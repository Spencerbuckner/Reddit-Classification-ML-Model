Admission that I was right all along.,"When Kenosha was still burning, when the riots were still raging, when the reports of gunfire and death blazed their way across social media, I withheld my judgement. Before the bodies of the decedents were even room temperature, the shaky, grainy, handheld smart phone videos of the incident, start to finish, from every angle, were all over youtube and other outlets. So, I watched them.

I watched a kid trying to help people out suddenly get chased by a large man who cornered him and then took the bullets from the gun in lieu of what he was really trying to take, which was the gun itself. Clearly, self-defense.

I then watched the kid running toward the police, not away, in order to report the shooting as quickly as possible. I heard the cries of ""Cranium him!"" I saw the people running after him. I saw them continuing to throw things at him until he tripped and fell.

I saw him get up and continue running away from the threats and toward the police. I saw him fall again. I saw him holding his fire through all of that pursuit, until he was trapped on the ground with one person jump kicking him. The kid fired twice at this assailant, but missed. Again, that was self defense. I saw the second decedent ""cranium him"" with a skateboard and take a bullet for it. Again, self defense.

I saw another would-be assailant with a gun in his hand advance on the still prone kid on the ground and displayed the only lick of sense among all of the kid's assailants that night when the kid pointed his weapon at him, but did not fire. The assailant same up short. But then, he did the shitty math, and in the instant his gun hand came down to aim at the kid, the kid fired for the last time, vapourizing the assailant's bicep. Again, clearly self defense.

I watched the kid advance toward the police with his hands up and I watched the police ignore him and move on. The kid did everything in his power to A) help people who needed help during a chaotic time, and B) not get made dead because of or despite it.

This is not to say that my judgement on those videoes, some more intelligible than others, was perfect. I was certain that the thing that the first decedent threw at the retreating Kyle Rittenhouse was on fire, owing to its true nature at a plastic bag which caught the intense lights of the parking lot in such a way as to give the impression of flames. When another person informed me that that was wrong, that the thing thrown was not on fire, I asked for evidence of that. The person helpfully brought my attention to another video from another angle that I hadn't watched yet. I watched it that same night, and I changed my mind. There was no flaming object thrown my decedent number one.

Everyone who is only now getting their information about the actions of and around Kyle Rittenhouse on that night in Kenosha and discovering that the opinions they'd formed about him had been wrong, I know what I based my first opinions of him on.

In honor of the 246th birthday of the United States Marine Corps here's a little history about the Gadsden flag.,"[The Gadsden flag](https://i.imgur.com/HwkKdh0.jpg) is a revolutionary war symbol.  The first recorded appearance of the symbol was at the first mustering of the Continental Marines and it was used during the first mission of the Continental Navy/Marines.  The timber rattlesnake was a contender against the bald eagle for the national symbol.  The snake on the flag has thirteen rattles, representing the thirteen original colonies. 

Here's what Ben Franklin had to say about the timber rattlesnake and the Gadsden flag:  
‚ÄúI recollected that her eye excelled in brightness, that of any other animal, and that she has no eye-lids.  She may therefore be esteemed an emblem of vigilance.  She never begins an attack, nor, when once engaged, ever surrenders.  She is therefore an emblem of magnanimity and true courage.  As if anxious to prevent all pretensions of quarreling with her, the weapons with which nature has furnished her, she conceals in the roof of her mouth, so that, to those who are unacquainted with her, she appears to be a most defenseless animal; and even when those weapons are shown and extended for her defense, they appear weak and contemptible; but their wounds however small, are decisive and fatal.  Conscious of this, she never wounds till she has generously given notice, even to her enemy, and cautioned him against the danger of stepping on her.  Was I wrong, Sir, in thinking this a strong picture of the temper and conduct of America?‚Äù  
  
He also had this to say about the snake's rattle on the Gadsden flag:  
‚ÄúOne of those rattles singly, is incapable of producing sound, but the ringing of thirteen together, is sufficient to alarm the boldest man living.‚Äù",Conservative,1636528744

ABOLISH the Filibuster and PASS The Women's Health Protection Act -- NOW!!

BODY COPY:

The House just passed the Women‚Äôs Health Protection Act which would guarantee a person‚Äôs right to an abortion throughout the US.

That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs more important than ever to abolish the filibuster so the Women‚Äôs Health Protection Act can pass the Senate and get to President Biden‚Äôs desk.

The oppressive Texas anti-abortion law has taken effect and states like Florida are already planning on copying it. It‚Äôs more important than ever to make sure a person‚Äôs right to abortion is protected on the federal level.

Abortion bans are state-sanctioned violence. They‚Äôre about controlling people‚Äôs bodies and lives, especially people of color and low-income folks.

The Senate needs to ACT NOW. We can‚Äôt allow Roe v. Wade to be stripped in state after state and people‚Äôs autonomy to be taken from them. ABOLISH the Filibuster and PASS The Women's Health Protection Act -- NOW!!",Liberal,1632515191

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgK4Io8pFPs&amp;t=144s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgK4Io8pFPs&amp;t=144s)

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=733qT1WT9aM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=733qT1WT9aM)

I started watching the first vid (from like 8min in because the link automatically goes there, lmk if that was a mistake) and it's clear that they are conflating their criticisms of the new pride flag from a visual standpoint (thinking it looks ugly or a unnecessarily complex is ofc a valid opinion) with the legitimacy of the pride movement itself

They think that the pride flag isn't needed, and therefore anyone who uses it is self centered and arrogant. The premise that they state directly is that lgbt people are doing just as well as non lgbt people and don't have any major discrimination

Anyone who looks at data would know that lgbt people still face increased rates of discrimination, violence, and social stigma and rejection. Literally the fact that most lgbt people still have to worry about how to ""come out"" to their family and friends, fearing anything from rejection to outright violence, is enough to justify people using whatever pride flag they like

They're trying to convince their audience that homophobia doesn't exist anymore and thus pride is useless or bad. But they don't bring up any data or reasoning behind their personal opinions of it being fine in the UK

Then they talk about the rapper, while doing so they imply that children who are too young to do xyz, can just cut off their genitals and change their gender

In reality, rarely does any trans child under 18 go through any kind of surgery. And if they do, it would only be after a medical doctor extensively observes the child and their records and finds it medically necessary for their mental health

And that only happens if the doctor is sure the child understands their decision completely. But that happens very rarely

But people like Sargon Akkad or whatever his name is want you to think that a 7 year old can just walk into a doctors office and demand a same day sex realignment surgery

In reality, it's more like a 16 year old talking to multiple doctors for years and everyone coming to the conclusion that the benefits of surgery outweigh the risks

The rest of that video is honestly just bad comedy ""haha trans people can't have kids but they'll try to get half the world"" or something like that.

Last thing about that one: straight pride isn't necessary neither is a straight rights campaign because no one is going after the rights of straight people. Is there any political group trying to reduce the rights of straight people? No, but there are many who try to make discrimination against gay people legal.

They outright reject that people rn are campaigning for lgbt rights because they think, for whatever reason, that lgbt rights aren't being threatened and lgbt people don't feel uncomfortable. Both are wrong ofc

2nd video

Okay they're hyperfocusing on one argument they disagree with so far

So people were saying that the shooter was racist because he chose to target a place where mainly Asian people were. Their argument is that since the shooter didn't say he had racist motivations that it's crazy to believe the shooting had anything to do with race. If someone shoots an Asian restaurant and then claims ""I just wanted to shoot a restaurant"" you couldn't blame people for thinking that there are more motivations given the location he chose. Or if someone shoots a black church only to claim ""I just wanted to shoot a church"" then you wouldn't blame people for assuming he still had other motivations.

Even if you disagree with people who say that we have to assume race was a motivation given the context of everything but the shooter's words, you can't just blame people for disagreeing with you or think they're crazy.

Wait the murderer first targeted an Asian spar and then drove 27 miles to shoot another Asian spar?

C'mon, they can't possibly think it's crazy for people to think he is racially motivated

They really think that unless the shooter explicitly says it's about race then it's unjustified to say race was part of it?

Subconscious bias exists for one, oh and he could have been lying. Racial terrorists tend to be treated harsher in court and prison than a random shooter.

Literally if they just thought for longer than a minute they'd figure this out.

It fits their narrative that people pay too much attention to race. That's the only reason why they are criticising people who say it definitely was racially motivated so much. They want their audience to think ""oh so people claim racism when there isn't any"" when it comes to other problems too.

Then they talk about the model minority myth. They mention how Asians on average are performing better than black people on average despite also having had systematic racism. They claim Asians are doing better because of cultural values and then dismiss the idea that slavery is still affecting black people

The systemic racism that black people had to deal with was and is completely different than Asians. And yes, centuries of slavery is actually a good example. They must think that all discrimination is the same, no matter the type or duration.

Third video:

So kids show is basically saying ""families with two dads, two mums, or two non-binary people and any sexuality can be happy"" and that's a bad thing? The show seems kinda boring to me but like I'm not gonna make a video and complain about it being bad lmao

Also, asexual people are accepted in the lgbt community because many asexual people think that there must something wrong with them or their lack of sexual desires may affect their mental health by affecting relationships or whatever, so ofc the lgbt community should be accepting. The lgbt community is about being happy with your sexuality, and asexuality counts.

""agenda"" lol I love it when they use that word cause the agenda is just accepting people for who they are. If I had a nickle for everytime they use that retoric, I'd be a billionnare by now.

Okay now he's saying that pride is forcing labels onto children and making them ""pick a box"". No.... It's about letting everyone know that if you are gay/lesbian/trans/whatever that it's okay and you should feel happy.

If some gay child thinks that something is wrong with them, they might be helped by their cartoons saying ""it's okay to be gay""

People like him think that if we wouldn't mention lgbt stuff at all then no one would feel bad. But our society is heteronormative (the norm is to be straight) so children might be confused if they don't feel heterosexual and we know as a fact that children who are lgbt face more difficulty accepting themselves.

And LMAO, he just said that it's a undeniable fact that the ""cultural forces"" want kids to be gay. That's just so ridiculous. Pride is about accepting people who are lgbt \*because\* many people want them to just be straight.

He says young people don't have a sexual identity yet, well what if someone gets bullied at school because they have two dads? Or because they like to dress differently or whatever. Why does this guy have such a problem with messaging that is literally just ""be proud if you're lgbt or have lgbt people in your family""

I'd love it if this guy pointed out where and when the videos said or even implied that you shouldn't be straight. Notice how these people never talk about anti-lgbt violence or discrimination? It's because they want their audience to think that all this pride stuff is for nothing

Also why would there be such a massive effort to turn kids gay? Like who is doing this and why? There is no monetary or strategic advantage gained from that. His conspiracy theory doesn't make any sense because even the simple question of ""what would anyone have to gain from that"" can't be answered.

Do you know anything about the upcoming elections to the Russian parliament?,"Most likely not as our media usually does not care about what is happening in other countries.

A very interesting political situation is developing in Russia at the moment: in the event that Putin decides to participate in the presidential elections in 2024 (and the recent amendments to the constitution allow [this](https://time.com/5857003/vladimir-putin-russia-fifth-presidential-term/)), he will need an obedient parliament. At least most of its members should be under his control.

Therefore, the Kremlin is now paying close attention to the upcoming elections to the State Duma (Russian parliament). Many well-known opposition candidates, such as the communist [Grudinin](https://www.dw.com/en/russia-communist-grudinin-barred-from-parliamentary-election/a-58626095) and the liberal [Shlosberg](https://www.rferl.org/a/russia-opposition-shlosberg-barred/31401176.html), were barred from participating in the elections. That is why they and many of their followers and oppositionists sympathizing with them call for boycotting the elections.

But some part of the Russian opposition, inspired by Navalny's plan, proposes another way - to vote for anyone other than Putin's United Russia party and thus prevent it from gaining a majority of the votes. And usually the ‚ÄúYabloko‚Äù party, probably the only truly liberal and opposition party in the country, acts as ‚Äúanyone other‚Äù. For example, Navalny urged to vote for Yabloko member Daria Besedina, and she eventually [won](https://meduza.io/en/feature/2019/09/09/navalny-s-smart-vote-for-the-win).

The Texas situation,"I consider myself a solution oriented guy.  So a few things come to mind here.

1.  The reporting site is getting kicked, but they could find another provider.  So when it comes up, flood it with two things:  Church member names and fake names.  Statistically speaking, the largest abortion opponents also comprise the ones who get most of the abortions.  They make excuses for themselves and because they come from ‚Äògood families‚Äô they look down on the selfish ‚Äòothers‚Äô.  But if they start having to worry, the law might change.  Very r/leopardsatemyface.  ‚ÄòI didn‚Äôt think ‚ÄòI‚Äô would be reported!‚Äô Yeah, it‚Äôs ugly, but let‚Äôs be real here, conservative  religious women have opposed every advance of women‚Äôs rights since suffrage.  They‚Äôre electing the same problem people.

2.  If you have single friends in Texas, tell them as an act of protest to go dark on Texans.  ‚ÄòWill not date a Texan‚Äô when that‚Äôs on millions of profiles, maybe the men of that stupid state will rethink their choices.  (Not really my idea, I got the idea from a story about how women in Ancient Greece ended a war by refusing to have sex with their husbands until there was peace)

3.  Relocation services and hosting services.  Help women move out of that stupid state.  Set up a fund to help them find work, housing, etc.  nobody should be trapped in ‚ÄòA Handmaiden‚Äôs Tale‚Äô.

4.  Rescue vans to help women get across state lines to clinics if they need it.",Liberal,1630728247

I need to get this off my chest.,"
Okay so just to start this I‚Äôm so sorry if this post is triggering or offensive I just have a few things to get off my chest. Please keep in mind this post is not supposed to be an excuse it‚Äôs just an explanation of what my life looked like at the time. 

Just yesterday I remembered something about the younger me and now I feel like the worst human on earth. 


Okay so when I was younger I was pretty sheltered and uneducated about social issues up until 15. I had an older brother who would use slurs all the time. He would say the f slur when he was annoyed with people or found them stupid. Me thinking he was cool at the time and wanting to be like him, I would say those words too. But genuinely I had no idea the word had anything to do with the LGBTQ community. I know I have said other slurs that he has. I hate to say it but I used to say the n word. I never said it at anyone I would just quote funny videos or vines that I said it. I never said those words targeting anyone, I thought they were bad words that were edgy and funny to say, but of course that doesn‚Äôt make it okay in any way shape or form, and in no way is an excuse. I regret it deeply. Once when I learned the weight of these words I stopped using them in my vocabulary.  Fast forward I‚Äôm 20 now and when I remember the old stupid me I literally get so angry and honestly feel so guilty. Like I‚Äôm so upset. I‚Äôve grown a lot since then and I recognize the amount of privilege I have in my life by not being in minority group, and I feel so sick that I would ever use words that are so harmful and hurtful just to be funny or edgy. I‚Äôm I a terrible person? Can I ever forgive myself, and move on? What do I do? 
It‚Äôs so far from who I am now that I forgot about the things I‚Äôve said. Now that I remember, I feel like I‚Äôm a fake and a fraud. I feel like the liberal tik tokers and the liberals online are perfect. I‚Äôm so terrified that what if I‚Äôm still a bad person because I used to act like that.",Liberal,1630591040

Our Covid cases are through the roof. It feels like what NYC described in Spring 2020. The difference is NY had nearly no warning Texas has had over a year. 

I will fully admit I could be wrong but, I feel like Biden is doing nothing. He made a post about not letting right wing Governor's stop states from protecting themselves. It feels like that is exactly what is happening though. 

School just started and hospitals are already maxed out and our daily death count is only rising. 

Is there no way to step in and stop the craziness???  Surely there has to be something. 

I would also like to add Houston has one of the biggest Hospital networks world wide and is no longer accepting patients.

All of the news networks lied to us about the situation at Kabul airport to keep our eyes glued to them.,The Taliban never entered the airport property. Yes they were in the city and everyone knew it. The people were scared. US troops had a confrontation with a few civilians on airport grounds. The civilians had weapons. They didn't disarm themselves. The troops shot them. This caused all the commotion. The locals all panicked thinking the Taliban were invading the airport. They were not. Then the scenes of the people cramming onto the C-17 and running on the tarmac. Some men thought thier lives were in danger even they they were not. At least 3 of them died clinging to the planes landing gear. The news networks let us believe that the Taliban were invading the airport for days and kept showing the same videos of the one plane even though they were flying out many more planes daily. They knew the airport was surrounded by thousands of Marines and Army Rangers. They also knew the Taliban had agreed not to stop the evacuation. Only days later when there was no news of a slaughter at the airport did they let on that things were under control moments after the infamous C-17 took off. All news channels are a business.

My Thoughts on Covid,"THIS RIGHT HERE! üëèüèªüëèüèª

I have done my best to respect the diverse opinions regarding COVID-19 over these past few months, however the ER nurse that posted this brilliantly sums up my train of thought :
Please just take politics out of it and read this with an open mind using common sense.üì∑

""Anyone out there who can tell me what our end game is with the covid 19?

What is the magic formula that is going to allow us to sound the all clear?

Is it zero cases?

The only way that will happen is if we just stop testing and stop reporting.

Is it a vaccine?

It took 25 years for a chicken pox vaccine to be developed.
The smallpox inoculation was discovered in 1796 the last known natural case was in 1977.

We have a flu vaccine that is only 40 to 60% effective and less than half of the US population choose to get one, and roughly 20,000 Americans will die of the flu or flu complications.

Oh, you'll mandate it, like other vaccines are mandated in order to attend school, travel to some foreign countries, etc.

We already have a growing number of anti vaxxers refusing proven, tested, well known vaccines that have been administered for decades but aren‚Äôt necessarily safe!

Do you really think people will flock to get a fast tracked, quickly tested vaccine, whose long term side effects and overall efficacy are anyone's best guess?

How long are we going to cancel and postpone and reconsider?
You aren't doing in person school until second quarter?

What if October's numbers are the same as August's?

You moved football to spring?

What if next March is worse than this one was?

When do we decide quality of life outweighs the risks?

I understand Covid can be deadly or very dangerous for SOME people, but so are strawberries and so is shellfish.

We take risks multiple times a day without a second thought.
We know driving a car can be dangerous, we don't leave it in the garage. Many speed and don't wear seat belts.

We know the dangers of smoking, drinking and eating fried foods, we do it anyway.

Is hugging Grandma really more dangerous than rush hour on the freeway?

Is going out with friends after work more risky than 4 day old gas station sushi?

Or operating a chainsaw?

When and how did we so quickly lose our free will and give up our liberty?

Is there a waiver somewhere I can sign that says, ""I understand the risks, but I choose a life with Hugs and Smiles, and the State Fair and go to Church and go hug my Mom in her retirement home?

I understand that there is a minuscule possibility I could die, but I will most likely end up feeling like crap for a few days.

I understand I could possibly pass it to someone else, if I'm not careful, but I can pass any virus onto someone else.

I'm struggling to see where or how this ends.

We either get busy living or we get busy dying.

When God decides it's your time, you don't get any mulligans, so I guess I would rather spend my time enjoying it and living in the moment and not worrying about what ifs and maybes, and I bet I'm not the only one.

The main belief in the conservative side is that Trump will run again in 2024 and will easily win vs most likely Harris. They don‚Äôt think Biden will be capable of another campaign thus he will decide not to run again and Harris will take over. 

The other belief is that either Crenshaw or Nikki Halley or both, will step up and run on the republican ticket.

Am I a part of the problem?,"
In no way is this post supposed to make me or my parents look like victims. I just need some perspective because I‚Äôm really struggling with this. So both my parents are conservatives almost in their 60s. They are both understanding people and have very good hearts. I myself am on the very opposite political spectrum as them. The thing that stresses me out is that they voted for trump. They are not trump supporters they just voted conservative because they always have because the way they grew up or whatever. I‚Äôm just so scared that my friends will find out they voted for trump and hate them. Neither of them are really educated about politics at all because they are constantly working and barely have any time to themselves. (I know that‚Äôs not an excuse it‚Äôs just what I noticed.) If they fully understood the weight of everything they might have voted differently. I know deep down they are good people that care deeply about people. And for some reason I feel guilty for not hating them. Am I a part of the problem for still wanting a good relationship with them?

Could randomly choosing people to serve in government be the best way to select our politicians?,"I'm a huge advocate of something known as **[sortition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sortition)**, where people are randomly selected to serve in a legislature. Unfortunately the typical gut reaction against sortition is bewilderment and skepticism. How could we possibly trust ignorant, stupid, normal people to become our leaders? 


# Democracy by Lottery

**Imagine a Congress that actually looks like America. It's filled with nurses, farmers, engineers, waitresses, teachers, accountants, pastors, soldiers, stay-at-home-parents, and retirees. They are conservatives, liberals, and moderates from all parts of the country and all walks of life.**

In the most commonly discussed implementation of sortition, lottery would be used to construct a legislature. Random sampling would be used to draw around 100 to 1000 people to form a house of Congress. Service would be voluntary, for a fixed term, and be well paid. From there, the selected people would have the responsibilities and powers of any elected legislature. These sorts of legislatures would have substantial advantages against elected ones:

* Because of [random sampling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_\(statistics\)), a sortition Citizens' Assembly would have superior diversity in every conceivable dimension compared to any elected system, including race, class, sex, religion, ideology, cognitive ability, profession, and anything else you can think of. Sortition is therefore the ultimate method of creating a [proportionally representative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportional_representation) Congress. 
* Without the threat of elections demanding ideological purity, a sortition assembly is better able to compromise with their fellow citizens and reach consensus. 
* Without the need for elections, legislators no longer need to waste time campaigning but can rather focus their time on their actual job.
* Legal bribery in the form of campaign donations is eliminated. 
* The nature of lottery creates a more egalitarian Congress ruled by regular people rather than the elites of society. 
* The nature of lottery possibly crushes the formation of political parties - parties that often form due to strategic campaigning needs to win elections. 



# Real World Evidence

Sortition is not a shower-thought. Sortition is thousands of years old and is the topic of active investigation by political scientists. Hundreds of sortition-based [Citizens' Assemblies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizens%27_assembly) across the world have already been conducted. The decisions they have come to have been of high quality in my opinion. For example:

 * The BC Columbia Citizens Assembly was tasked with designing a new electoral system to replace the old [first-past-the-post](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-past-the-post_voting) (FPTP) system. The organizers brought in university experts. The organizers also allowed citizens, lobbyists, and interest groups to speak and lobby. Assembly members listened to all the sides, and they decided that the lobbyists were mostly bullshit, and they decided that even though the university experts had biases, they were more trustworthy. This assembly ultimately, nearly unanimously decided that Canada ought to switch to a [Single-Transferable-Vote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_transferable_vote) style election system. They were also nearly unanimous in that they believed FPTP voting needed to be changed. This assembly demonstrates the ability of normal people to learn and make decisions on complex topics. 
 * In [Ireland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizens%27_Assembly_\(Ireland\)), Citizen Assemblies were instrumental in the legalization of both gay marriage and abortion in a traditionally Catholic country. These assemblies were used to resolve politically volatile subjects so that fearful politicians would not have to. 
 * Recent 2019-2020 Citizen Assemblies in Ireland and [France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizens_Convention_for_Climate) reached consensus on sweeping, broad reforms to fight climate change. In Ireland taxes on carbon and meat were broadly approved. In France the People decided to criminalize ""ecocide"", raise carbon taxes, and introduce regulations in transportation and agriculture. Liberal or conservative, left or right, near unanimous decisions were made on many of these proposals.
* [America in One Room](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/02/opinion/america-one-room-experiment.html) deliberative polling experiments have demonstrated the ability of regular Americans to deliberate amongst one another and come to compromises. 

The usage of sortition has also been documented in many societies:

* The greatest known example of sortition is its use in ancient Athens, where lottery was used to select magistrates, legislative councils, and the People's Court. 
* Sortition was also used in combination with elections for the selection of leadership in Renaissance-era Italian City States such as a Venice and Florence. 
* Examples of sortition have also been documented to be used in [Indian tribes](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/dech.12651). In these tribes, sortition results in an egalitarian government where power is shared. When elections were introduced into these societies however, the author observed the rise in power hierarchies and even ""toxic masculinity"". 


In these societies, you will find echoes of the claims I made above. Political parties in these societies are weak. Concentrations of power are reduced. 

# Comparing to Elections

All electoral methods are a system of choosing a ""natural aristocracy"" of societal elites. This has been claimed by philosophers such as Aristotle since ancient Greek elections 2400 years ago. Elections are biased in favor of those with wealth, affluence, and power. 

Moreover all voters, including you and me, are [rationally ignorant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_ignorance). We don't have the time nor resources to adequately monitor and manage our politicians. On average we vote ignorantly, oftentimes solely due to party affiliation, or the name or gender of the candidate, rather than actual qualification. We assume *somebody else* is doing the monitoring, and hopefully we'd read about it in the news. And yes, it is somebody else. Marketers, advertisers, lobbyists, and specialists pay huge sums of money to influence your opinion and construct your news reality. Every elections is a hope that we can refine our ignorance into competence. IN CONTRAST, in sortition, normal citizens are given the time, resources, and education to become informed using the process of [deliberative democracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deliberative_democracy). Normal citizens are given the opportunity to deliberate with one another and come to compromise. IN CONTRAST, politicians constantly refuse to compromise for fear of upsetting ignorant voters - voters who did not have the time nor opportunity to research the issues in depth. Our modern, shallow, ignorant management of politicians has led to an era of unprecedented polarization, deadlock, and government ineptitude. 


# Implementations

There are many forms which sortition could take. I list some from least to most extreme:

* The least extreme is the use of Citizen Assemblies or Deliberative Polling in an advisory capacity for legislatures or referendums. Examples of these have been implemented in Ireland, the UK, France. They have also been implemented in Oregon in the form of ""Citizens Initiative Review"" (CIR). Here, a random body of Oregonians are tasked with reviewing ballot propositions and giving referendum voters information about the propositions. 
* A hybrid, two-house Congress has been proposed where one house is chosen by lottery while the other remains elected. This system attempts to balance the pro's and con's of both sortition and election, and use both as checks and balances against each other.
* Random sortition legislators can also be added to existing parliamentary bodies to complement, rather than veto, the decision making capabilities of elected officials. 
* Rather than have citizens directly govern, random citizens can be used exclusively as intermediaries to elect and fire politicians as a sort of electoral college. The benefit here is that citizens are given the time and resources to deploy a traditional hiring &amp; managing procedure to make political appointments. This system removes the typical criticism that you can't trust normal people to govern and write laws.
* Most radically, [multi-body sortition](https://delibdemjournal.org/article/id/428/) constructs checks and balances by creating several sortition bodies - one decides on what issues to tackle, one makes proposals, one decides on proposals, one selects the bureaucracy, etc, and completely eliminates elected office. 



# The History of Sortition
Democratic lotteries are an ancient idea whose usage is first recorded in ancient Athens in 6th century BC. Athens was most famous for its People's Assembly, in which any citizen could participate (and was paid to participate) in direct democracy. However, the Athenians also invented several additional institutions as checks and balances on the passions of the People's Assembly.

* First, the Council of 500, or the Boule, were 500 citizens chosen by lottery. This group developed legislative proposals and organized the People‚Äôs Assemblies.
* In addition, lottery was used to choose the composition of the People‚Äôs Court, which would check the legality of decisions made by the People‚Äôs Assembly. 
* Most government officials were chosen by lottery from a preselected group to make up the Magistracies of Athens. 
Athens used a mixture of both election and lottery to compose their government. Positions of strategic importance, such as Generals, were elected. 

## Historical Beliefs about Democracy 

Athenian democracy was regarded by Aristotle as a ‚Äúradical democracy‚Äù, a state which practiced the maxim ‚ÄúTo be ruled and rule by turns‚Äù [2 pp. 71]. For Aristotle, ‚ÄúIt is accepted as democratic when public offices are allocated by lot; and as oligarchic when they are filled by election.‚Äù 

Renaissance writers thought so too. In The Spirit of the Laws, Montesquieu states, ‚ÄúVoting by lot is the nature of democracy; voting by choice is in the nature of aristocracy.‚Äù

How is it that ancient and Renaissance philosophers understood democracy to be selection by lottery, while modern people understand democracy to be a system of elections? Democracy was redefined by Frenchman Alexis de Tocqueville while he travelled through the United States in the early 1800‚Äôs. Tocqueville was impressed by the equality of the social and economic conditions of Americans in the early years of the republic. Importantly, Tocqueville believed that the institutions of American ‚Äútownship democracy‚Äù, law, and the practice of the tyranny of the majority made America a land of democracy. Therefore he wrote and titled a book, *Democracy in America*, that redefined America as a democracy rather than the aristocratic republic which its founding fathers had desired. Tocqueville‚Äôs book would become a best-seller around the world. 

With Tocqueville‚Äôs redefinition of democracy that excluded the practice of lot, the traditions of democracy were forgotten and replaced with the electoral fundamentalism of today. From historican &amp; advocate David Reybrouck, 

&gt; ‚ÄúElectoral fundamentalism is an unshakeable belief in the idea that democracy is inconceivable without elections and elections are a necessary and fundamental precondition when speaking of democracy. Electoral fundamentalists refuse to regard elections as a means of taking part in democracy, seeing them instead as an end in themselves, as a holy doctrine with an intrinsic, inalienable value.‚Äù [1 pp 39].



# Concluding Remarks

There are many legitimate arguments against sortition, and these philosophical arguments have been waged for thousands of years since democracy's invention. We might assume that yes, there are superior people, and that the superior ought to lead the inferior irrespective of the inferiors' wishes. If you believe in this kind of superiority, democracy is not for you, and elections aren't for you either (How ridiculous is it to ask the inferior to select the superior!). But if you do believe in democracy, if you believe that people ought to govern over themselves, then I think you need to take sortition seriously as a way to enhance democracy and finally take it to the 21st century.
