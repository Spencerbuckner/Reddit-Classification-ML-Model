1,Store music volume controls,"My most recent job, and hopefully last, in retail was as a store manager for a clothing/home goods store.  I did it well, but working in retail just kills my care about other humans, and I was a bitter person. 

We had a wonderful Muzac system in-store, which entailed getting a CD mailed from them (corporate approved) putting it in the system, and it would play the same \~20 songs on loop until you hated them. Eventually, another CD would come and likely only change up a few. The best, as you all know is the Christmas music...just the same Christmas songs on repeat over and over, slowly driving you mad. I soon realized that in our system I had control over the volume, despite not being supposed to be able to. 

It always made me feel good when a customer would mention how quiet our music was, especially around the holiday season. I just shrugged and said, we were working on it. There were times it was almost silent...",0,1636729678
2,Ways of Rejection,"I'll just hop right into it as there's no point in setting the scene. What are your guys'/gals'/nonbinary pals' way of rejecting customers who are overly friendly or, even the opposite, overly aggressive? I've tried the stern approach and grey rocking them but surprise surprise, that seems to make angrier/try harder and it's like man, just trying to do my job as painlessly as possible and get out on time. I am aware of the fact that i'm a 28 year old female in a traditionally male consumer industry, but even my boss and coworkers who are male can only do so much. I was thinking about doing a form of rejection business card, but I'd like to know what the people think",0,1636725427

7,Why is the music so loud?!?!,"I work at an office supplies store. This happened to my coworker (C) and I saw it all go down. 

A lady (L) comes in asking if we fix printers. She shoves a really beat up machine on the counter. 

C: Unfortunately, we don't. However, there's another store down the street called (redacted) that does. I can tell you how to get there if you want. 

L: What do you mean you don't?! You fixed my last printer! 

C:... Oh, I see. Well, we don't have any specific printer fixing tools or anything. Are you sure it was this store? 

L: Yes!!!

C: Ah. Well, maybe we did in the past, but we don't currently fix them. Sorry about that. 

It goes back and forth like this for a few minutes while the lady absolutely insists that we fix printers, as if we’re just pretending not to, simply for the sake of being a jerk. Eventually she seems like she’s about to relent, but points something else out.

L: Why is the music so loud?!

(For reference, we have the usual generic music playing over the intercoms like every retail establishment in America. It's not at an inappropriate volume by any means. I'd turn it down if I could just because the songs are repetitive, but that's neither here nor there.)

C: I'm sorry, I have no control over the sound system. 

L: Can't you go turn it down?!?! 

C: No, ma'am, I can't. It's all set by corporate. We can't adjust the volume or change the songs or anything. They actually call us if we try to adjust it.

L: But it's too loud!! 

C: I'm sorry, ma'am. 

L: Come on! There has to be something you can do about it! What if I came in here and just started screaming obscenities at everyone? 

C: I'd call a manager over to ask you to leave. 

L: Okay, so call a manager to have them turn down the music!!! 

He does. Our manager (M) comes up and basically repeats the exact same information about how there's nothing we can do. 

She sits there like a deer in the headlights for about ten seconds. 

L: Well, that's unacceptable to me!! 

M: I'm sorry, ma'am. 

She proceeds to slam her printer on the desk, and speedwalks out of the store. 

As always with these customers, we spend the next five minutes ruthlessly mocking her once she's out of earshot.",0,1636660906

10,Conflicted and,"So yesterday I let my job know my last day was the 17th. However, the unorganization is crazy. So tomorrow, i'll be telling them that my shift is the last one and I'm gone. I didn't have the key to access the cigarettes and so I had to call management when a customer bought the wrong ones, and I was told customers aren't allowed to exchange or bring them back after the cigarettes are bought. I didn't know this,  because aside from going through training on a computer I didn't get a formal training for the job. Yet I was looked at like I was crazy. 

Then the store manager idk if he was joking or not, but he stated I was leaving after he invested ""so much time in me"" which he didn't.  It took them two weeks, just to call and have me come in for training (which was on the computer). I politely told him that the other job called and offered it to which he said, ""I called you when no one else would."" (this isn't true, I left my previous job and I wasn't the one that went to them. I got the job throw connections, they pulled my resume). For him make those statements out on the floor while I was at the register was ridiculous and disrespectful. 

Then when I was leaving he looked at me, and while it might have been him just joking he called me a traitor. At that point I was done. Mind you, someone stood there watched me and helped during my first day on the register and that was the basis of my training. And I was the only cashier that day and today (my second day on the register).

15,"No, Sir. It is NOT my job to know","Shout out to my fellow retail workers who have dealt with this particular butt holery on the regular. We must stick together to preserve whatever semblance of sanity we have left.

Like all retail workers, I've dealt with more than my fair share of idiocy, rudeness, ""I wanna talk to your manager"" cry babies, and just breathtaking audacity some people with their ridiculous god complexes just because they went shopping... You are no god, Brad. You are not special, Karen. You're the same pre-designed embodiment of slowly decomposing natural soil fodder that I am. The only difference is workers like me know the rules better than you pretend to think you do because it is our job to know them. \*ahem\* Rant over.

I'm a cashier where I work, so you can imagine all the crap I deal with on a daily basis. It's not a physically demanding job, but it is extremely taxing mentally. One thing I deal with on a pretty regular basis is customers expecting more of me than I'm able to provide. Not so much because I don't know certain things but I'll be reprimanded if it do.

The other day at work, I had just rung up a customer when I greeted another one who came in. He immediately comes up to me holding something. I'll call him... Cliff. Cliff because he made me want to jump off of one with his attitude.

Anyway, Cliff didn't greet me back and just asked me, ""Where can I find another one of these?""

I didn't recognize what he had and asked him what it was. Cliff's head jerked back and looked at me like I asked him a stupid question. ""What do you mean you don't know?""

I blinked. ""Um, because I've never seen that before? But if you tell me what it is, I can get someone--""

Cliff interrupted me. ""I'm asking YOU. It's your job to know this stuff to help customers.""

I raised my eyebrows (a natural reaction, I can't help it) slowly corrected him, ""No, sir. It's NOT my job to know. MY job is to ring up customers at my register and occasionally look up items missing barcodes. Now, if you tell me WHAT that is (I pointed to the thing in his hand), I can get someone whose job IT IS to know and where to find it.""

At first Cliff looked like he was about to give a half-baked rebuttal but thought better of it. He apologized and told me what the thing was. Part of a toilet that he needed to replace. So I called for a plumbing specialist on the work phone and she told me exactly where it was. I repeated to Cliff the aisle she said it was down, Cliff walked off without another word. Not even a thank you.

I muttered, ""You're welcome.""",0,1636499296

22,The Story How Some Old Guy Spent $226 in 37 Minutes After Closing Time,"So the store I work at closed at 9pm. At that time, customer service makes an announcement that we're closed. Most people hear that and leave shortly after. But this night was different. It's about 8:55pm which is when we go around the store and check for any customers, simple as that. But when I was checking around our toy section, I see this old guy looking at the giant unicorn plushies. A little sus but whatever. I go up to him and let him know that we close in a few minutes. He says he has a few more things to get, but first he asks ""Where are your razor knives?"" (Apparently he meant hunting knifes). I take him to the sporting area to the knife lockup. He looks for a bit and doesn't even get one. Which I think was a good thing since he was just in the toy aisle. He decides he is done shopping and heads towards the front. But just when he was about to enter the cash area, he wanders over to the Automotive area, spends 10 minutes there and gets random car parts. At this point we have been closed for 15 minutes and he is now heading to the Hardware area. Now most of us are starting to worry about this guy. I mean he was looking at toys, then knifes and then hammers n sh!t. Finally after 25 minutes past closing he goes up to the cash lane. But first he grabs 4 bags of generic off brand chips and 12 chocolate bars. The time is now 9:30pm, half an hour since we closed, he is now at the checkout counter with his cart of diabetes and car parts. I overhear he spent $226 mainly on cash lane sugar. Now I don't know if he was just an old guy who doesn't understand technology but the cashiers have to explain to him how a debit card works. After taking 70 seconds to find the exit door, the sensors for not paid for items goes off (whatever its called). But we don't stop him becuase we just don't give a sh!t any more. At 9:37 his taxi pulles up and he finally leaves. So 37 minutes and $226 later, we clock out and go home.

I found out later that this isn't the first time he has done this. Apparently most days when he comes in, he gets multiple items, wanders for a few hours, and then just leaves without taking any of the items and leaves the cart in the middle of the store.

27,Just open up another register!," 

So I work in a smallish  sized store. On a typical day we only have two employees ( (usually management and a cashier) working at any given time. This means one employee is on the register while the other walks the sales floor and stocks. On a normal day, this is more than enough, but occasionally we get a rush of people in the store and we open up a second register, if the second employee isn’t in the middle of helping a customer on the floor, but they always jump onto a register as soon as they are available.

 Now, our customers are usually understanding and patient when these rushes happen. However, in the last week I had two separate occasions where full grown adults threw the biggest fits because there wasn’t a second register currently available. 

The first one happened during our shift change. These are the worst since things are chaotic already. To make things worse, it was the end of a new employee’s first shift. I had just clocked out and was gathering my things, double checking the schedule for my next shift and who I would be working with. 

The manager that just came in 20 minutes prior switched the other two employees out. During this time, there were only one person in line and maybe five groups of people in the store total, so it was the ideal time to switch them. She took the new person to the office to count their till and help them with clocking out. 

While I was heading out, the phone went off. The on duty manager was still busy, so I went ahead and answered it. It happened to have been another store asking questions, so I decided to sit down and answer a few of them before I left. During this time (about 2 minutes), out on the floor, everyone in the store decided they were going to leave. 

I finished talking to the  other store and walked out. Instantly, I was approached by man asking about what sounded like “I lookin’ for a job.” This isn’t uncommon and so I pointed to the poster next to the register that gives the website to apply and explained we were looking for new employees. And then conversation went like this:

Man “Yo, I only got a couple things. You mind opening up another line?” 

Me “Sorry, but I actually am off the clock and leaving. However, they are almost done in the office and be able to open it up in a minute.” 

Man “Why can’t you just open up the second line?”

Me “I don’t have a draw. I am off the clock.” 

Man “Why isn’t there another damn checker?”

Me “Sorry they are in the middle of a shift change and having some technical issues.” (New person was indeed having a hard time figuring things out.) “They are almost done and will be out in a minute.”

Man “If you weren't in that goddamn office yapping your mouths off, y'all be done. This is shifty ass customer service.""

This really pissed me off  because  the ""yapping"" he was hearing was me talking to another store about work related questions and the manager guiding the new girl through the end of shift process. By no means were we ""yapping.""

And then, as to make me even more irritated, some middle aged-teen (really hard to tell) girl jumped in. “Why do you have a shift change in the middle of the day anyways? It be smart if you don’t change shifts.” 

I was done. 

Me “I don’t make the schedule, I just follow it. Someone will be out in a minute. You can either wait here at this closed register or you can wait in line. Sorry, but I am off the clock.""

I walked into the office to let them know the tension on the floor and walked back out. 

The man must have also walked out because he left his small handful of stuff on the counter. Funny thing is, the woman that was originally behind him in line was up at the open register checking out. If he wouldn’t have waited 3 minutes, he could have left with what he wanted. 

I’ll share the second one on another post someday during the week since this one got to be long. 

TL;DR There was a large rush of customers during a problematic shift change. Man argues with me about opening up another check lane when I was already clocked out and ready to go home. 

For all of you working retail this holiday season, hang in there!",0,1636394038
28,Customer whistled at me,"This happened yesterday at a home improvement store. You can guess what I’m talking about. I work the paint department and it was a busy Sunday. I’m taking orders for paint at the desk and run down one of the aisles to grab paint for one of the orders. A customer stopped me and was asking for a specific color caulk (we didn’t have it). 

I’m still helping this man when I hear loud whistling from afar. I look around to see a man at the back wall in the flooring dept.  (about 200 ft away) staring at me and waving his arm. This man whistling at me had already frustrated me because for me, whistling is a very rude thing to do to get someone’s attention. Let alone that I was obviously helping another person. 

I politely excused myself from the man I was already helping (keep in mind I still have other customers waiting at the desk) and walk over to this whistler. As I walk up, I say in my customer service voice: “Excuse me I heard your whistling, did you lose a dog?” He yelled back in a confused but frustrated tone: “what?” I replied: “I was helping this man when I heard you whistling and looking around, so I assume you were trying to call a pet back to you. He angrily said, “No! I’ve been waiting here 15 minutes.”

“Have you talked to the people at the flooring desk?”

“No I’ve been waiting here!”

“Well I’m sorry sir but I work paint and am already helping a line of customers, but I can page someone for you.” And I turn to walk away before he can say anything else. He looked like he wanted to say more but I was already back in the paint aisle. I had considered not doing anything at all to help this rude man but I ended up paging for some in Flooring to help him. 

This may seem small and I may be seen as a jerk for what I said, but I will not tolerate those who whistle (or snap) at people.",0,1636390060

I did meet a lot of great people though, a few of which I’m still very close friends with to this day. I have lots of fun stories but this is still my favorite years later. 

One of my coworkers, a cashier named Julian, (name changed for all the usual reasons), was one of the nicest people I’ve every met.

One night, he and I were the only people left working. We were standing around, talking, not doing much of anything. It was a very slow night. Two men walked into our lane. They looked extremely similar, like brothers. One of them set a single pack of condoms on the conveyor, and nothing else.

Me and Julian didn’t think anything of it, we’ve checked out customers with all kinds of orders. We went through the motions, Julian cracked one of his jokes, they took their stuff and started to walk away. As they left, Julian said “you guys have fun!”

39,weird customer interaction,"i just recalled this story from a year or so ago. the customer i had this interaction with was a white male from in his mid 20s or so. when this happened i was around 21 and i'm a woman. i work at a shoe store and i was ringing him up at the register. toward the beginning of the interaction, he looks at my name tag and asks me the origin of my name. more specifically he asks, ""where is your name from?"" i don't want to type out my name, but i'll give y'all a hint that a famous model and a famous tennis player both have this name (idk if that really gives anything away but whatever). i tell him that my name is japanese.

next, he asks if i've ever been to japan. i reply, ""yes, several times."" he asks which parts, so i tell im ""you know...tokyo...kyoto..."" i list some random places in japan. then he asks which of my parents is japanese. at this point i feel slightly uncomfortable, but i assume he's just trying to make conversation (?). i tell him my mom is japanese. then he asks me which parent i'm more like, my mom or my dad. i reply, awkwardly, ""i guess my mom..."" this question really got me because no one has ever asked me that before. as a biracial person i get asked some interesting things, but never this. and i still have no idea why he asked that. i mean, i have some ideas but i don't know for sure.

then he says that he's never been to japan, so i kind of awkwardly say, ""oh...yeah you should definitely go it's great there."" at this point my coworker has walked over and she's doing something at the next register over and i can tell she's hearing our conversation. at this point i want to end the interaction bc i'm done ringing him up and i really don't want to talk to him anymore, so i tell him to have a good day and nudge his bag with his items inside toward him. he leaves soon after that and my coworker and i kind of exchange looks. typing this out, it might not seem like the conversation was that weird, but the vibe was kind of uncomfortable and i didn't really know why he was asking me these things.",0,1636160752

50,An Entirely Justified Chewing Out,"This story is a little bit different than most of what's on here. It's more about the absurdities that can be created by the retail environment than how despairing and terrible working retail itself can be.

When I was in my mid-twenties and in my last years of college, I had a job at a deli in a grocery store. Being an actual adult that came in sober 90% of the time, I was a prize stallion in the stable of 17 to 19 year old children that were working at this place to afford beer for the weekends. Not saying that I was good at my job, just that I wasn't abysmally terrible at it.

One day, when it was slow, I was chatting with one of the stock guys, Matt, while he was hiding from the manager out of fear of being assigned nonsense busy work. He claimed, in the middle of some rant or another, that being a stock guy at the store was actually a really dangerous job, probably the most dangerous in the store. I corrected him on this, reminding him that my job involved plunging my hand towards a blade that was designed to cut flesh(the same stuff my hand it made of) literally thousands of times per day, all with no protection beyond what a latex glove could provide. I can think of at least 4 instances where I was slicing a small piece of meat and shaved the fingerpad of my glove off. Whereas with im, outside of tripping and hitting his head on something, there was nothing particularly high-risk about being a stock guy. 

We end up discussing this for about thirty minutes before he said, ""Well, what about the Crushinator? That could hurt someone.""

The Crushinator was a large, heavy piece of machinery in the small warehouse out back that someone had named after a thicc robot from Futurama. It could take an enormous pile of cardboard and pneumatically smush it down to a dense cube of mashed trash that would be held together with wire-ties fed through some ports. It was huge, made terrifying sounds, had a lot of power behind it, and was the safest piece of equipment in the entire store. The thing would only operate if you held down two buttons that were a foot apart. You practically had to hug the thing to make it work. If the door for getting a trash cube out was open, it wouldn't turn on. If the gate for throwing cardboard in wasn't latched, it wouldn't turn on. If the internal pressure sensors detected uneven resistance, like a panicked human hitting the descending slab of steel in mindless terror, it would turn off and required a key to reset it. The Crushinator was less dangerous than a cargo dolly.

I pointed all this out to Matt, but the kid still insisted that it was hazardous to use. I got fed up so I offered him a challenge. If he or any of the other stock guys could figure out some way to actually kill themselves with the Crushinator, I would give them $50. Matt called bullshit, so I showed him the money. $50 was more than enough for an evening's worth of malt liquor and weed, so he took the challenge.

For the next few shifts, I would get called away numerous times by one of the stock guys so that I could review their theoretical scheme to off themselves with heavy machinery. The first one said that the thing had hinges and braces that would easily crack a skull if you tripped into it. I pointed out that that was true of the walls, the sink, and the weird pile of cinderblocks we had out back and denied him his half a benjamin. Another one involved crawling into it and having someone else operate the buttons, but I told him that assisted-suicide didn't count.

They must have brought at least a dozen plots to me over the next few days. This came to a head when the manager went into the back to see all 6 stock guys on shift trying to build some extended mechanism to operate the buttons from a distance. When asked, the children tattled on me, as children are wont to do. I got called into the office and got *heckin*' yelled at for a solid twenty minutes. I couldn't fight it, I legit had it coming. I was the best guy in the whole deli though, I think that was the only reason I didn't get fired then and there.

One of the stock guys did end up winning it a few weeks later. He figured out that if one of the wire-ties for a crushed trash cube failed it would whip out at terrifying speed. He showed me how one coming undone would rip through cardboard if it hit right. He claimed that if the wire sliced a vital spot, it could kill you. It wasn't technically the machine doing it, but I gave it to him anyway. The next day, he called off due to being super hungover.

This was more than ten years ago at this point. I work in an office now, dealing with completely different absurdities, but I don't think I'll ever forget the image of a bunch of children desperately trying to figure out how to off themselves.",0,1636040984

52,Customer Service Or...,"I manage a store and early in my management career I was a newly minted Supervisor closing up for the night. Our store closes at 8PM so we're cleaning and counting our tills, the usual bit. At around 8:15 theres a sudden loud banging on the door. One of the guys cleaning looks out the window and sees a couple looking absolutely irate. They gesture we're closed and point to the hours sign. The guy takes none of that in and keeps banging on the door. This continues until the associate gets tired of being a mime and comes to grab me while I'm closing the till. I say I'll talk to him and head over to the door.

When I open the door I say, ""Sorry sir, we closed fifteen minutes ago."" Before I can even finish the sentence the guy looks me dead in the eye and loudly proclaims, ""CUSTOMER SERVICE OR FUCK OFF."" It left me reeling for half a second before I said, ""I'll take the latter. Have a good night!"" and locked the door.

The next day my manager was in and we had a great time reading an email to the store, HR, and Customer Service, where the 'customer' states that whoever I was should be fired for opening the door and addressing him at all since we were probably counting the till, and that I had zero sense of customer service, and I should never be promoted beyond my position.

The irony was I looked him up and he actually worked at a local music store a friend of mine worked at. My friend told me the dude got fired a few months later for unprofessional conduct, and I've been promoted to store manager.

54,A customer called me aggressive years ago and I’m still pressed about it!,"So I used to work at a shop that sold macarons. My town is a huge tourist destination in Florida and we had these chocolate tours, basically a guide will take you on a tour of the city and you go around and sample sweets from all the different sweet stores. I apologize in advance as I’m bad at paraphrasing so this will probably be long. 

One day one of the tour guides comes in with an elderly couple. We had just opened and I had yet to see my boss that day. She told me that we had been added to the chocolate tour and my boss said her guests could have two macarons and two pieces of chocolate on the house. I hadn’t been told about this so I was a little confused.

I wanna preface the next part by saying: I have worked in customer service jobs since I was a young kid. I don’t want to sound cocky especially as I’m not confident about a lot of things in my life, but I do know for an absolute fact that I’m fantastic with customers and I treat every one of them like we’ve known each other for years. I have never broken my retail persona and have always maintained a calm, friendly composure. Every boss I’ve had has loved me for this.

So, I tell her “I will be happy to do that for you, but I haven’t heard anything about this so would you mind if I called my boss real quick to confirm there wasn’t any miscommunication?” And she’s seemingly totally fine with this, both her and her guests said they totally understood, it was no problem at all, they didn’t want me to get in trouble, etc. So I call and get the go ahead. I apologize multiple times for the confusion and there doesn’t seem to be any problem. Because of the confusion I make an extra effort for them, I pull out the cute silk bags we reserve for events and tied their sweets up real cute with a little bow, just basically made it a little extra special while having a nice chat with the guide and her guests. She’s all smiles, they’re all smiles, I think we’re all good. 

They go to sit down and eat. I can hear their whole conversation (this is important later) and they’re just having a nice chat about the town, the guide is asking if they enjoyed their tour as this was the last stop, nothing about me whatsoever. The guide gets up and says goodbye to them and leaves for her next tour, and the couple likes the chocolates so much that they come up and ordered a few more and throw a few bucks in the tip jar. Nothing seemed off whatsoever and I forget about the whole thing and go about my day.

Later I hear my phone go off with a text from my boss, but I don’t get to read it because we get hit with a small rush. Towards the tail end of the rush my boss comes in and asks me if I saw her text. I say no and she tells me to go read it, so I do and it’s a screenshot of an email from the guide. It basically said something along the lines of: 

Your employee was very rude and aggressive. My guests and I spoke as we were sitting to eat and they said he made them very uncomfortable and they felt unwelcome. They said they wanted to order more but didn’t want to talk to him again so they didn’t. It was very unprofessional that he didn’t know about the chocolate tour and he gave us attitude about it.

I walk over to my boss after reading the text and just say “aggressive? what?” And she pops OFF. She loved me because I was one of the few working there who actually worked instead of spending my whole shift on my phone. She’s going off, like “How dare she say that! You’re my best employee I know you would never be aggressive to ANYONE! This is so ridiculous! I watched the cameras and you were SO nice to them! It’s not your fault that I forgot to tell you about the tour!” The cameras have audio so she could hear every word I said and every word the guide and her guests said. They didn’t say a single word about me, they were very happy with their sweets, and like I said earlier they DID order more stuff after the guide left and we had a very nice interaction. So basically, at no point did they have the chance to talk about me to where I could hear them as the tour guide and them parted ways while they stayed in the store. She straight up lied about multiple things. 

The only possible reason I could think of for the bad review she sent my boss (luckily she didn’t leave a public review anywhere) is that she was embarrassed because there was the small hiccup in the tour with me being confused when she first walked in and I was the easiest person to take it out on. The doors to the macaron cooler do make a kind of loud sound when you close them, and I tend to be a little heavy handed anyway, so maybe she interpreted the smack of the doors as me slamming things around in anger? My boss and I were both confused as hell. I’m lucky that I had the cameras to back me up as well as my boss’s trust, I know a lot of bosses will stand by the customer no matter how ridiculous the complaint is. She ended up cancelling all future tours because she didn’t want their business after that. But man! I work so hard and exert so much emotional labor in order to give people the best experience possible so I feel very…… indignant about the whole thing.

It's funny because I figured the day I finally left the joint would be a triumphant moment, kind of like my previous job before it. Instead...I felt rather melancholy like my first job (which I was forced to leave due to closure). I actually came close to crying, though I'm not sure if its because I'll genuinely miss the place or just fear of being jobless because I currently don't have another source of income (until I get the new job, presumably). Regardless, hopefully the next joint I go to will be easier on the frustration since it's something I enjoy working around...holiday season not withstanding.",0,1635909332
60,The Bath Bomb,"First time poster, mobile, etc. 

I work as a cashier at a large supermarket chain, usually running the self-checkouts. 

One day, I’m on break grabbing a quick snack to make it through the shift, when a bath bomb comes rolling across the aisle into the next one. A few seconds later, it comes back the way it came. This repeats a few times until it gets stuck under one of the shelves. 

After a moment, my manager looks into the aisle looking for it. We stare blankly at each other for a few seconds before she dies laughing. 

Apparently she was trying to give it to a coworker who refused it, and they had started passing it back and forth like a soccer ball. 



To this day, I make it a point to roll something toward her at least once a shift.

61,Customer Goes Off On Me Because I Asked Her Non-Verbal Autistic Child To Stop Chewing On The Merchandise,"This happened a few years ago, back when I was working at a certain outdoor/hunting store. Y'all know which one I'm talking about. I was a cashier and most of the time I had very pleasant interactions with the customers. I was an anxious kid at the time, so having pleasant encounters was much more relieving than the unpleasant ones, of course. But now and then you get that one customer interaction that makes you want to say and do irrational things. This particular customer made me want to go off on her. 

So, it's about an hour to closing and this older couple comes up to my lane with presumably their kid. Kid doesn't really say anything, but he's grabbing all the magnets and other little crap we had to offer at the cash lanes. At first I was preoccupied with ringing out the couple's stuff, just a couple toys and fishing gear, whatever. It was when the mom decided to return one of the toys when I noticed her child was full on putting the reusable twist ties in his mouth. Like, handfuls of twist ties in his mouth. Parents don't have a single f*ck to give, clearly. They were just letting him do it. 

I'd like to think I'm good with kids, so I took a gentle approach at first. This backfired horrendously on me. Here's how that interaction played out: 

Me: ""Hey, buddy, please don't chew on the twist ties. That's yucky, and we don't wanna put yucky things in our mouths, right?"" 

The kid seems to understand and puts the chewed on ties back in the container they were in. Gross. 

Mom: ""Don't you dare tell my son what to do! He's autistic! How can you expect him to know any better?!"" 

Me, sputtering: ""I- uh.. Excuse me?"" 

Dad: ""Yeah, and he's non-verbal too! You should be ashamed of yourself, telling an autistic child not to do something!""

How was I supposed to know the kid had autism? 

By this point, I'm starting to get overstimulated and shaky. I don't even have words to say, just sputtering nonsense trying to get anything out. 
Then, by some really damn unfortunate coincidence, a woman at my coworker's register swoops in like a hawk to gang up on me too, and side with this couple I was ringing out. 

Other Woman: ""Hey, I have an autistic son too! I know how hard it must be. It's a shame this cashier girl doesn't know how to handle an autistic child."" 

Mom: ""It is hard, and she should have known better than to tell my son what to do. Do you want to exchange phone numbers? Maybe you and I could get in touch about our kids being autistic."" 

Okay, now I'm just pissed off. I don't care one way or another whether or not your kid has a disability. It's still your responsibility to teach them right from wrong. Chewing on twist ties is just gross and I don't think I made a bad call politely asking the kid to quit doing that. 
This customer went off on me, which led to me having a breakdown in front of everyone. I was crying, shaking, and I felt guilt tripped because I had no idea her kid was autistic. 

Eventually they all left and my coworker tried to console me, reassuring me that I didn't do anything wrong. Even my manager told me I did the right thing. She sent me on an extra smoke break to calm down. Still, it made my blood boil to be embarrassed like that and to have to let my anxiety interfere with my work. Needless to say I don't miss working retail, not when people like that are becoming so much more common.

62,"""Special Assignment""","I work for a well known grocery chain as a Courtesy Clerk. My story just took place:

So, I get done helping a customer out to their car. As I come back in, my dept. head comes and asks me to do a ""special assignment"". I say sure, even though I haven't had my last break yet. So, me and my manager (ill refer to them as M now) head out to his car and drive down the road. He got a report that people had been leaving shopping carts down the road at a little thrift store near the location where the store I work at used to be before moving to it's current location. We get down there and there's about 10 big carts and 2 small carts there. Me and M decide to split the carts and take 5 big carts and 1 small cart each.

Now, picture this: you have to carry 6 heavy carts to another location, and we're talking really heavy carts. Now imagine, if you will, that the location you have to carry aforementioned carts to is 3-4 miles down the road and you have to walk back there with these carts. Not a fun time, is it? Well, that's what we did. It took us a minute, stopping to break and catch our breath so often. 

Finally we got back and M let me go on break. Unfortunately, I now have to go back to work, and guess what I have to do for the last 30 minutes of my shift? Cart retrieval....

65,That Bank life (Sometimes It Ain't Worth It),"Just some interactions I had with customers. I'm a teller at a local bank. 

Me: ""Alright, since you have cash I just need you to fill out this deposit slip.""  
Customer: ""Do I have to? I don't know my account number.""  
Me: ""That's okay, I just need a name and amount on the slip and I can use your debit card or ID to find your account number.""   
Customer: ""Okay, well my name is -""  
Me: ""On the deposit slip sir.""  
Customer: ""Oh.""

Me: ""I'm sorry sir but we aren't open yet.""

Me: ""We open at 8:30AM.""

Me: ""830AM sir.""  
I'm still confused about this one. He's been there since 6AM, and thinks we open at 2?AM?PM? I don't know.

Customer: ""Can you tell me what my balance is?"" Hands me a card from a different bank.  
Me: ""Sorry, but you need to call different bank for your balance, I wouldn't be able to do anything with this card.""  
Customer: ""But you're the bank, I just need my balance and I'm not gonna pay a fee from the ATM. Just tell me what my balance is.""   
Me: ""I can't sir. Different bank is a separate entity. You should be able to call the number on the back of the card to speak to their customer service or call the local branch.""   
Customer: ""Can you call them for me?""  
Me: ""...they're not going to speak to me about your account.""

Customer: ""I need to open an account for my boyfriend.""  
Me: ""Okay, is he here with you?""  
Customer: ""No, why does he need to be here with me? I just need to open an account for him.""  
Me: ""He needs to be here.""  
Customer: ""But I have his information.""  
Me: ""Yes, but you're not him.""  
Customer: ""I don't understand why you can't just let me open the account. I know him, he's my boyfriend.""

67,I decided to be nice to the rude customer,"I am working as a cashier and naturally you get to meet all kinds of people on the job.   
It was near the end of my shift and I've had some especially nice customers, so I was in a pretty good mood when dudebro arrived. Anyone could immideately see that he was pissed. He comes up to me and just **slams** his items down. I ring up his items while he mumbles under his breath. His total comes up to approximately 9€, he hands me a 50€ bill and says ""give me two tenners"".  
Being the helpful fool that I am I ask him if he would prefer 4x 10€ or 2x 10 and 1x 20?   
His response: ""Yo *I said* give me two tenners!""  
Me, feeling a bit sassy ""yea communication can be difficult at times"" 
Him ""what did you just say""  
I decided to leave it at that, because I didn't want to risk an escalation, or my good mood for that matter. Dudebro picks up his things and while doing so drops the two 10€ bills without noticing. At this point I am just staring at him, while my shoulder Devil and Angel started a violent cage match and he is ranting about some machine in pur store not working properly. Sadly there are no children in line, which might just pocket the money and be happy about it, but instead only two nice old ladies who I know will give the money to me, where it will just end up in the registry.  
So with the guy already going ""Why are you looking at me like that, whats your Problem"", I point out, that he dropped his money, he goes silent, picks it up and leaves.  
  
  
For the rest of my shift I debate, whether he deserved to loose the money, but done is done. Until the next day, where he shows up again. He was paying at another registry and seemed to be less angry, so I just ignored him until he showed up next to me after paying.  
He actually came back to apologize for his behavior the previous day, because and i quote ""I was so angry and mean, but you still told me when I dropped my money"". I thanked him for apologizing and he went on his way.  
I felt fucking amazing for the rest of the day and to this day it is one of my favourite customer interactions I've had on the job. If I'd been in a worse mood that day I probably would have kept silent to punish him for being so rude, but I am very glad that I didn't",0,1635838386

""Which?"" the colleague asked.

&amp;#x200B;

""The lady near you in the bread aisle,"" the manager replied.

""Got her.""

From my position, I could see my colleague, a petite woman keeping an eye on the alleged shoplifter.

""I can see something in a green bag.  But I can't see what's in it,"" the colleague said.

&amp;#x200B;

""I'll go offer a basket,"" I offered and left my position at the cash desk.  I took a basket from the metal holder.  I pressed on my headset and said, ""Which aisle?""

&amp;#x200B;

As if right on cue, the lady placed her basket of groceries and asked for some cigarettes.  I opened the cupboard, took out the cigarettes, and showed it to her to confirm it was the correct one.  It was.

&amp;#x200B;

I then placed it on the cash desk after scanning them so that she couldn't reach for them.  She paid for the groceries and scanned her membership card.  Bingo.  Now we can trace her details.  After she left, I printed another copy of the receipt and left it on the manager's desk.  He said he will forward the detail to HQ and they can either trace the lady and send her a ""nice letter.""

74,Difficult Customer Wants His Steaks,"So this is not really my story, our evening manager told me about this and I felt the need to share.

At 9:15 PM a customer calls wishing to speak with the meat department.  The department closes 9 PM, so the evening manager, Steve, takes the call.  A man wants to know if we how many of the strip steaks we have on sale are left.  Steve checks and tells him there are 7 left.  Man thanks him and hangs up.

15 minutes later the man calls back.  He doesn't believe Steve and wants him to check again.  Although annoyed, Steve agrees to check and tells the man there are now 6 strip steaks.  The man shouts angrily, ""I knew it!  You lied to me!"", to which Steve calmly responds, ""No sir, another customer bought one since your last call.""  The man retorts, ""We'll see about that.  I'm coming down there right now, and you'd better have those steaks.""

So a little before 10 PM this middle aged man comes to the registers with a few strip steaks asking for the manager.  Steve comes down and the customer rips into him.

""You lied to me!"", the man accused, ""You said there were 6 steaks left and there are only 4!""

Just barely keeping his cool, Steve replies, ""There were when you called, but like last time another customer bought some.""

Now fuming the man demands that Steve go back and cut him some more strip steaks.  Steve refuses since he's not a trained cutter, and even if he was the department has been cleaned for the night.  The man then demands a raincheck for 30 strip steaks, since this is the last day of the sale.  Steve says no, he can give him a raincheck for up to 4 steaks, and to make up for his troubles he'll let him have one of the 4 steaks he's buying now for free.

Not good enough for this customer, he leaves without any steaks or raincheck and promises he'll be calling the store director in the morning for such terrible customer service.

All the sudden this older man walks up to me with 2 kids about 3 and maybe 5 years old. He approached me close and whispered "" I need you to take these kids, i dont remember taking them or where I got them."" My first thought was to climb the counter and tackle the guy and ask for help. A second went by, i took a deep breath and my line noticed I am not okay. I was about a millisecond away from grabbing the guy and not letting him leave my sight. For some reason I started being insanely friendly to the guy and Offered support, he started crying and surrendered. I was friendly with the guy until i got near the front doors and locked everyone inside the building. I had to play it off as if i had no idea what was going on with the doors. But I was not gonna let anything happen to these kids. I dialed 911 and had to explain the situation. Meanwhile the kids were really quiet so i grabbed them 2 waters. When the police arrived i unlocked the door. About an hour of the guy being in handcuffs, it turns out the guy was watching his grandkids and was on drugs., I volunteered to keep the store open for the police and kids until the parents arrived and keep them all warm. Unfortunately when the parents arrived one of them had a warrant out for their arrest and both parents were under the influence of drugs as well and the kids didnt get to go home that night. After the police had left I walked out of the building and almost every customer during the scene was still there to hug me and shake my hand.

Okay, so I work at retail in a clothing store (it’s also a family business), and today a lady entered the store. She picked maybe five jackets to try them on in the dressing room, she then went inside and spent maybe forty minutes inside, then left putting all the clothes in the table. It wasn’t enjoyable to see the jackets inside out and even with the hangers inside the dressing room, but I didn’t care much since it wasn’t the first time that happened.

The thing is that before leaving the store — I already put the jackets in their places —, she was still inside looking for whatever else. I was tidying the clothes from the table and she was trying on a hat, then left it in the wrong place. I was getting pissed off but still I kept chill. I told my mother that she was being very disrespectful and that I didn’t like her (I didn’t). She then picked three more clothes and then went to see some others in another place of the shop, I was kind of next to her, tidying some other clothes and… wow… she dropped the three clothes from the other side of the shop to the ground, and then, to add the cherry on the top, she then also dropped four shirts from their hangers to the ground. I was very very hoping she didn’t do that on purpose, and that she would pick them up or whatever, wanna know what happened? She didn’t. She just looked at them in the ground and was kind of walking away. I then went to pick up the clothes and said “oh joder, venga ya” (kind of like “oh fuck, come on”) and she noticed. I locked my eyes onto her and when she saw me, she said “It’s your job, right?” and then walked away. I was paralysed but was hoping to say something but I just didn’t… I just picked the clothes up and placed them in their places… went inside the storage room and had a muffin, very upset.

TL; DR: A mid-age lady knowledgeably dropped some (7) clothes to the ground, didn’t bother picking them up nor tell us about it, and when she saw my upset face, she then told me it was my job to pick them up.

91,I said what?,"Let me know if there is a better sub/reddit to post this. It did happen in retail but isn't customer related. I am a sales merchandiser working exclusively in WM stores. While I work in several different stores, my colleague only works in this one WM. She works for company AC while I work for company AD. All of my colleagues for company AC have their own individual stores and I would get along with them well, no problems at all. This particular colleague came up to me one day and said someone told her that I was complaining to them that I was criticizing her work ethic and all AC employees were lazy. I figured it was probably an employee but it could have been another merchandiser too. I assured her that I hadn't done that and I gave her reasons why.

First of all, I used to work part-time for company AC and considered them in high regard. I had tried to get a full time job with them before finally accepting a job offer from company AD.   
Second, I had no problem with this colleague. We talked every time I visited this store.   
Third, I had my own job to do. I had no idea what her job entailed and certainly wasn't going to criticize her.  
Forth, She was always busy from what I could tell and like I said, I really didn't care. It wasn't my business.  
Fifth and finally the nail in the coffin, This person described me telling them that it was the company that carried around the red Ipads. I'm color blind and don't go around describing things by their color. If I try and I miss, it's always embarrassing. 

I managed to convince my colleague that it wasn't me. It could have been someone else and a case of mistaken identity, but I'll never know because she wouldn't tell me who it was. All I know is there is someone in that store that doesn't like me for some unknown reason. I am glad she confronted me about it though. It gave me the chance to defend myself.",0,1635520379

93,A customer is incensed he has to pay for what we do. An ongoing saga. Caution: long story,"In the interests of anonymizing the people involved, let's say this incident happened around the time the death Star was built. Updates will be post dated when they are released from the ancient archives.

Cast:
Owner- lovely bossman who is gentle and kind, but has nerves of steel
Customer: someone who doesn't understand how business works
Me: me

Backstory: So I work with firearms. The laws where I work say that a firearms dealer holds the firearm until it is licensed to a person. For various reasons, this can be easy-ish, or it can be hard. We charge storage at $1 per day to store a firearm. We have lots of people who happily leave their firearms with us for years at a time because reasons.

Story: customer bought a firearm. It is a very nice one, they chose well. It arrived at the store 5 years before death Star construction. They applied to license it and were denied. That sucks. They applied two more times, denied two more times. This took ~4 years to play out.

While this was going on, customer never paid storage. Owner called customer and told him fees were owed, customer always promised to come in and sort it. To the surprise of no one, customer never came in and sorted it out.

Now we can see the death Star orbiting peacefully over our skies, and owner asks me to help. I message customer and let him know fees are due, and if he didn't want to pay fees he could let us sell it to recover costs. He calls and says he didn't know he owed money, but he would come in and sort it out. Shockingly, he didn't.

8 weeks later I messaged him again. I informed him that we needed payment withing a week or we would sell firearm, deduct costs and pass on the remainder. No answer.

I gave him two weeks because I'm a nice guy. I messaged customer and told him we would be selling the firearm because he hadn't paid, and giving him the remaining balance. No answer.

I advertised the firearm and had someone offer the full amount within the hour, which was 50% above his purchase price because collectibles. I messaged customer and informed him he had a few more days to pay storage or it would he sold.

Phone rings. Customer is livid. He asks how I can sell something that's not mine, he was never told he had to pay money for storage, he is taking this to solicitors etc. I remind myself that with the desthstar overhead all problems will soon be over. Customer says he will come to the store within a few days and sort it, do not sell firearm. Owner said he will chat to customer and work it out. Not sure what archives will reveal about that chat, but I'm looking forward to it.",0,1635516236
94,A complaint,"Alright, strap in fellow retailers. 

TL; DR: lady buys a plain white $5 shirt she doesn’t like and tells me about how disappointed she is in my company. 

I work at a women’s higher-end clothing store, which generally caters to the 40+ population. Some people refer to it as the “old lady store”. Rhymes with Rico’s. Many Karen’s to be had and I have a plethora of stories from my 5.5 years there.

One day, i was helping a lady who had picked out a few things and I was ringing her up. Towards the end of the transaction she kind of started getting fidgety. And then, and I promise, this is word for word:

Her: “okay, so I’m not going to return or exchange or anything but... okay, really, I just want to b*tch. I want tell you how disappointed I am in a T-shirt I got here a few days ago. I got home and put it on, and I realized half the shirt was *single* stitched instead of *double*, and there is a small hole near the bottom of the front of the shirt. I can’t believe (store) would sell something like this. I mean really the quality has gone down. I am a LOYAL (store) member and have spent thousands here! I’ve been shopping here for DECADES. Never have I seen something like this. I’m really disappointed in y’all. I just can’t believe you would put out a product like this and sell it. I will have to stop shopping here if this continues”. 

She proceeds to pull out said plain white t-shirt… that she had bought from our final sale rack. For $4.98. Originally it’s priced at about $35.

Now. We can’t take final sale stuff back. But if we had had the same exact shirt, in the same color and size, I would have just traded her the new one for the damaged one and damaged the bad one out; it’s a work around in special cases since it doesn’t require going through the register system. I’m fairly positive the hole was from someone shoving a hanger back on the rack below the shirt, and not being careful, so it snagged. No big deal, it happens, I’ll be fair to you. If you’re nice.

The reason I didn’t say this was A. We didn’t have it. And B. If you preface something by saying “I just want to b*tch” AND have the shirt you supposedly don’t want to return on hand, then I will already know you have every intent to try to return something you were told you could not even if you say you don’t want to. Not only this, but 1. you are upset at me about something I have 0 control over (I do not manufacture the clothes, lady) and 2. are obviously expecting an additional discount or coupon (on top of the 40% off we were offering at the time). 

I politely listened to her rant and let her know that I was sorry she had had that experience, and that she should be sure to check that any final sale items meet her quality expectations before being purchased. I then told her the total for her new transaction, and when I handed her the bag I apologized again for the less than satisfactory top she had picked up a few days prior. She kinda just huffed and left. Also I looked up her account and she has not spent thousands. Lol 

Long story short - Please don’t have a rant at an employee about the quality of a shirt you bought and didn’t look at... I can’t control the quality and I don’t have anyone I can get in touch with at corporate to tell them about your issues with a heavily discounted $5 T-shirt. Just wear it to garden in or clean or around the house.",0,1635487966
95,Customer gets mad over a swapped price tag,"When I worked for a charity shop, I was doing stock work for the day.  I would put ""new"" stuff out for people to poke around and purchase.  I put out an item tagged about $15.  I didn't think much of it but I had the price in the back of my mind.  A couple of hours go by and ""Ruth"" brings up the item I put out on the sales floor.  I notice that the $15 price tag was covered up by another price tag of $10.  I totally remember this item being $15 so I told Ruth that the price WASN'T right.  I go to my assistant manager (""Bob"" from here on out) to show him and Karen followed me over, berating us for taking her time to ""go back and forth"" to get prices on items (earlier, I had to do something similar).  Bob then told her that the item WAS $15 and that I had the right to question a price if need be but told Ruth that she could have the item for the lowest sticker price.

I go to ring her up and Ruth is stewing mad. I apologize to her for taking her time and she said something about ""calling the company.""  I try to explain to her but she didn't want to her me or accept my apology.  Ruth's friend stood by outside the line to the register and never once corrected her behavior or called her out.  She put her card down to pay and then I ask if she wanted her discount for the day, totally forgetting about her card.  Then I ask her to pay and Ruth gets snippy at me for not paying attention and not putting her card in the reader for her.

Ruth finally gets her things and leaves but not before asking my co-worker what my name was (and I knew exactly why).  Even though none of this was my fault, I naturally freak out and get teary eyed so I go tell my Awesome Store Manager (ASM from here on out).  I told her what happened and Bob who had to answer to Ruth corroborated my story (my co-worker who named me said she'd back me up because she also knew the right price of the item).  

Later, ASM asks me how I'm doing and I told her that I was doing okay for the time being.  She then told me not to worry because she had my back and that the woman who did this to me was out of line.",0,1635485134
96,"In today's news, lady complains that fresh ground beef weights aren't exactly a pound to the decimal.","I'm like the rookie apprentice in a store meat department run by two 30+ year pros. They're good at being meat guys. When they grind our burger, individual trays typically weigh between .95- 1.1 pounds give or take, with some outliers in the .80s.

Today a lady was digging through all our packs of ground beef on display looking very dissatisfied, so I asked her if I could help her. She said, and I'm quoting, ""I'm trying to find 1 pound of beef but the closest I can find is POINT 98! My recipe calls for a pound. I don't understand why you do this. See? There's all this extra room in the tray for the extra little bit!""

Wow. It was hard not to laugh. I was just bringing out a fresh cart of burger so she had more options (settling on 1.03 pounds), but as she searched I tried to explain,

""We don't exactly weigh each tray as it's ground, but the meat cutters do their best. It's all by eye.""

I think she actually understood for the most part, but she definitely left slightly dissatisfied with her purchase of beef that wasn't a perfect 1.00000000000000 pounds on weight.",0,1635477370

103,Fired for being sick,"A post in another sub reminded me of this story. 

Back in 2002ish I was working at a clothing store that was fairly popular in my region. They sold a lot of jeans and other casual clothes. 

One week into working the store manager quit. Since I was the only full time with two part time girls I was unofficially moved into manager position. All the responsibilities, none of the manager pay. So I was opening the store 7 days a week, working by myself for 9 - 12 hours depending on the day and occasionally got an evening off. But often I was opening and closing and had help for a few hours in the evening. 

Two months into my glamorous underpaid position I was struck with bronchitis, tonsillitis and a UTI all at once. I managed to sneak away long enough to be seen at the walk-in clinic in the mall and get a prescription for antibiotics.

When I went back to the store I called the regional manager and told him what was going on.

His response was “well I told you that you could close the store for half an hour to go to the doctor but you couldn’t be any longer.”

“Well I’m sorry the doctor took longer then I expected but I’m super sick and this was the only time I could be seen. We need more staff”

Next day I come in to open and he’s already there with someone else. Told me she was the new manager and asked me to show her the ropes.

Two days later I was fired. They accused me of stealing from the petty cash. Then claimed since they had no real proof they wouldn’t press charges.

Shortly after that I was on a bus with all my worldly possessions and moving to a new province to take on a working student position at a large farm.

Next time I was home for a visit the store had gone out of business. All locations across the region were gone.

Well, this one lady came in and with a small handful of ‏‏‎ things to buy, delivered me a prewritten check well over the total for cash back. It raised numerous red flags right away. Here’s the thing, our store is the one of the few in my city that that takes out of town checks. But we don’t take checks from out of state. So if you have a check from Florida, you won’t be able to use it here. Her check was from Minnesota, though her ID was of this state. Second was that it wasn’t a bank check. We will accept credit union checks only if the union is one from our town but we don’t take checks from out of town unions. I usually distrust prewritten checks. It’s my own personal thing, I prefer to see the check written when people pay with one.

But when I explained it to her, good Lord you’d though I hit her and then threw her dog off a bridge.

Of course, she never came back my shift, I informed my boss and left a note for the manager in the morning.

109,Thanks... being kicked in the gut is exactly what I needed!,"So I'm stuck in retail for a while because my husband's unemployment last year financially ruined us.   
 We're rebuilding, but the path is long and frustrating.

Normally, I don't get recognized at all except by repeat customers, but recently, I was surprised by the mother of one of my college friends.  She was shocked to see me and asked, ""But why are you here?  You were so brilliant in school.""

My reply was not brilliant at all; it was a barely coherent jumble of 'lost job' and 'it's helping me get by right now.'  I have no idea how much of that she understood, but she hoped 'things got better for me' and left with such a sad look on her face.

She claimed it 'didn't work,' so I tried it out - I plugged in a nearby lamp and it worked just fine. Despite this she kept insisting it didn't work.

This was getting weird, so I asked her to show me how it didn't work, because it worked just fine for me. She plugged the lamp into the power bar...and plugged the power bar into itself. The look of triumph on her face when the lamp did not light up was really something to see.

It took way too long to explain that the power bar does not, in fact, MAKE power. Once that sunk in, she demanded a full refund on the power bar and would be bringing back the television she'd bought with it (her plan had been to run the television on the power bar, to save on electricity). At no point did she seem to see any humour, irony, or sheer idiocy in any of this.

112,You Want to Return This Sweater because the Fabric is Cold!?,"Obligatory First time poster, long time lurker here. 
       Sorry if the formatting is a mess, I'm currently writing this on my phone.
  
This story takes place yesterday when I was working returns for a large US retail chain, let's call them Bullseye.
    Anyway, this older customer comes up to my register, let's call her K, and I go through all the formalities, ""Hi"" and ""How are you,"" all the stuff you have to say to the customer even though all you want to do is process their return as fast as possible with as little talking as possible. And K wants to return a light green sweater from one of the more, pricey brands we have in the store.
   I scan the receipt and scan the tag on the item, now one of the things the system requires us to ask is if anything is wrong with the item or not, if we hit no, it goes through, it we hit yes we have to figure out if we can put it in salvage or if we have to defect it. 
  So I ask her ""Is there anything wrong with  this item?"" 

K: ""Yes, it's very cold""

Me: *freeze-frame* ""excuse me?""

K: ""the fabric is very cold, feel it? I got it because I wanted it to keep me warm but it just made me cold instead!""

Me: *is currently holding the slowly warming sweater in my hands.* ""Yes, I feel it, but ma'am, it's a sweater that you've only tried once, of course the fabric is going to be cool until you wear it long enough.

K: ""But it's still cold, it didnt keep me warm when I went outside""

Me: * is currently regretting all of my life choices* ""Well ma'am unfortunately Sweaters don't keep you as warm as a jacket does, but I will be happy to return this for you.""

Store policy is that they can return it for any reason as long as they have proof of purchase and it's still in good condition or was broken within the 30 day return period.
  So I go through the rest of the transaction, and hand her the receipt confirming the return was successful.

K: ""Oh thank you so much! Maybe I'll go see if I can find another sweater here that will actually keep me warm.""


TL;DR: Old woman returns sweater because fabric is cold, and it won't keep her warm after she only wore it once and walked outside wearing it without a jacket in cold, weather.",0,1635347686

114,Old tale of when I got to tell a lady off with impunity at geek squad.,"I used to work geek squad back in 13-14 time period. One of the things many department stores used to do, was delayed shipping for christmas gifts. 

Well if you remember the christmas season of 2013, you will remember the great ice age level ice storm which destroyed the world. At least according to the news.

What this did do, was shut down UPS and Fedex for a full 2 weeks. In December. 

Welp if you all will remember as well, the ps4 came out in november of 2013. Meaning many parents bought their kids one, and had the shipping setup to be delivered close to Christmas. This all brings us to the great ice age and the Karen who demanded a supervisor. Side note, the geek squad counter was the same counter as the customer service counter. The idiots in charge decided geek squad had to pull double duty.  

There I am at my geek squad counter into my 6th hour with literally, not figuratively, zero customers entering the store. The DM demanded the store be opened and refused to accept anyone claiming ice prevented them from coming in. (Yes this did cause an outrage and YES this did directly lead to both the store manager and district manager being fired.)

The store manager finally said screw it and went home for the day. Telling everyone to close up at their normal times. I was scheduled to leave in about 45 minutes when this lady come into the store mad as hell. 

She slammed a printout onto the counter and said ""LOOK My package has been delayed until next year."" I took a look and shrugged. ""Yeah everything is. UPS, Fedex, and amazon are all delayed due to the ice storm affecting nearly the whole country."" She gets even more angry. ""WHat are you going to do about it?"" I just shrug again. ""Nothing can be done. This would be on the shipping company."" She scoffs. ""No this is YOUR fault right here. You are responsible. I want you to fix this."" I just looked at her. There are no managers or supervisors in this store anymore. ""How? A refund can not be offered until the store has the ps4 back in stock. Without knowing the precise location no one can go get the ps4 from UPS, and even if we did there is no way for us to even get the package from hub."" (I used to work UPS LONG time ago.) She tapped her foot and said nothing. SO I pulled out my galaxy s3 and she was about to reach for it. I gave her crazy eyes and she stopped. ""You realize there is nothing that can be done. This will simply arrive a week after christmas."" She slammed her foot down and screamed that this was unnacceptable. ""Well unfortunately nothing can be done. If you want a refund you will have to return the PS4 to us. Which would mean taking it away from your kid. You could ask for a refund from UPS but because you spent more than 500, you didnt have to pay shipping. So you will have to accept it."" 

Her eyes lit up and she was about to say something else when a friend added. ""There are no managers or supervisors here."" There were only 6 of us in the store at the time. The ice was so bad that NO ONE was driving. The 6 of us were just idiots who wanted the overtime pay.

115,Refund on an item you got for free?,"The most infuriating interaction, I swear. For context, once or twice a year my store gives out what is essentially free money. During the slower sale months, we’ll give people back 5% of every purchase on a coupon set for the following month. It gets people back in the store when things are slowing down, they love it, and it usually ends up only giving each customer around 1-10 dollars maximum. Depending on how much they spend, of course. 

We are currently in a month of collecting these coupons. People can bring them in and redeem them for any purchase, but once spent they’re gone. We shred them, they literally disappear so people can’t take them from the garbage and reuse them. 

A woman came in and asked to return something. No problem. She has her receipt and she’s ready to go. I look at the receipt and I can see how she paid for this - $36.59 from our coupons last month. Nonrefundable. She didn’t pay a dime out of her own pocket for this item, and now she’s asking for a full refund. 

Me: I’m sorry ma’am but I can see here you paid with a coupons, which are non refundable. There isn’t any money for me to refund you for this item, because there wasn’t any money used. 

Customer: what? The total is $36.59. You can refund me the exact amount. 

Me: I’m sorry ma’am but I can’t actually do that. My system won’t let me refund money that wasn’t spent. Coupons are nonrefundable. 

Customer: that doesn’t make sense. I bought this item for $36.59, I’d like a refund of that amount. 

Me: Well you actually got the item for free, since it was coupons we GAVE you that paid for it.

I work at a dry cleaner and we have a bin for people to drop their laundry bags in so they don’t have to stand in line. It’s about a 50/50 split of people who actually use the bin and people who just leave their bag on the counter. It truly doesn’t matter; either way, we’re going to bring the bag to the back counter and take everything out to go over it for stains, etc. A customer just came in to drop off her bag and was apparently unhappy with my service.

C: customer.    Me: it’s-a me!

*C walks in with bag full of clothes*

Me: Hi! Just dropping off?

C: Yes. I’ll just leave it in here (bin) but I wanted to point out some stuff on this dress. I don’t know what I got on it.

Me: Ok!

C: *looks at dress for a minute but can’t find spot* Do they look for stains?

Me: We go over everything before we send it out.

C: Alright. *Struggles with drawstring for a few seconds before giving up* I’m actually just going to leave it up here (counter). I can’t get this bag closed.

Me: Ok!

C: …You don’t want me to leave it?

Me: That’s fine! I’m just going to bring it back here either way.

C: *sighs* It’s fine. *stomps out still holding her bag*

131,Policy is Policy,"I work as a cashier at a construction store. So, when people make returns and have no record of making a purchase they have to present a form of government ID so we can issue them a gift card. Their ID needs to be shown or scanned if they want to use the gift card, and if it's the wrong ID, even if it's a spouse's, we won't accept it. 

I had a guy come into my line who was making a rather large purchase, mostly wood, nails, etc. Just your basic building materials for whatever construction project he happened to be working on. When the guy got ready to pay he handed me the gift card I took it as per usual. 

Me: Hon, I need to see your ID. I just need to see the name. 

Guy: -hands me his ID- 

Me: -I check it over, realize the names don't match.- Sir, not that I'm an expert, but I don't think this is you. 

Guy: -glances at the name on the screen- That's my boss. 

Me: Is he here with you?

Guy: No. 

Me: Then I can't accept this, you'll have to pay with something else. 

Guy: He made a return and he wanted to use the money to purchase these!

Me: -trying to think of the best way to be diplomatic about this- Well I get what he's doing, he wants to keep all the purchases on one card, right? So he doesn't want to give you cash?

Guy: Yeah. -is glaring at me as I talk-

Me: That's smart and I like that idea. I have people that do that, but if he's not here with you I can't take the card. -smiles brightly and hands it back to him- 

Guy: I can call him and he can tell you. 

Me: Sir, even if does call and I speak to him, I still can't take the card. 

Guy: Fine, I'll pay with something else. 

At this point, I figure it's the end of the issue. He asks a few questions about items he purchased and asks me to re-check prices on certain things. As he's finally pulling out another card he starts up again. 

Guy: Why can't I use the card? He's my boss!

Me: I get that, but I still can't run it. It's policy. 

Guy: -grumbling and then raises his voice- What do you think, I stole it?

Me: -gives him a puzzled look-

Guy: He GAVE it to me!!

Me: How could you have stolen it if he gave it to you?

Guy: I didn't STEAL it!

Me: I didn't say you did. YOU -I make a point of gesturing to him- brought that up, not  me. Like I said, I get it. Your boss is trying to make it easier so you can do your job and he can do is. But I can't break policy for you, next time just have him come in with you or I can explain it to him if you want. 

Guy: -stumbles a bit over his words after this explanation, quickly pays, and then leaves-

Me: -moves on to the next customer-

Guy: -comes back in after fifteen minutes- It was wrong of you to do that. 

Me: -just gazes at him, waiting for him so I can move on to my next customer-

Guy: I want to speak to your manager. 

Me: You're more then welcome to, but that's not going to change the policy. 

Guy: -getting angrier and raising his voice- WHY NOT?! What's it even for?!

Me: -still being diplomatic- It's to protect hardworking people like you and your boss from someone trying to use their money. It's a pain in the ass, but it works. (This isn't true, it's to prevent theft, but at this point I was trying to get the guy to leave.)

Guy: Where's your manager?!

Me: -motions to the large sign posted across the store- At the customer service desk, you can talk to him if you want. 

Guy: You should've let me use it!!

Me: Sir, I told you, it's policy. 

Guy: But I HAVE the card!

At this point, I've had it with him. I had two customers patiently waiting for me to finish up this fiasco so they could checkout. I decided to put my proverbial foot down and make it VERY clear the conversation was done. 

Me: Sir, I'm NOT breaking policy for you nor risking my job. I have to get back to work -motions to the very kind people waiting for me- if you're going to make a complaint, then please do so. 

Guy: -starts spluttering angrily in Spanish-

With that said, I deliberately turned my back to him, and started ringing the next person in line. Guy hung around for five minutes trying to get my attention, waving his arms and making exaggerated hand motions to get me to look at him. I refused to acknowledge his presence at that point because the conversation on my end was over, and if he wanted to file a complaint with the manager, I figured he would go do so.

I had yesterday off, so I only got this story secondhand when I came in today. 

She came back first thing in the morning yesterday to get her phone despite saying she had work. Since it's a small business, the owner was the one working the front at that time. He'd already looked over the camera footage to hear the store's side of the conversation as well as listened to the THREE voicemails that she and a friend had left. 

Apparently the first words out of her mouth were, ""Is that RUDE woman here? You know, the *fat* one?"" To which his response was: ""Oh, you mean the one who is 9 months pregnant? Who kindly answered the phone after the store had closed to let you know your options to pick up the phone?"" which predictably left them without words.

I manage the retail side of a video game and electronics store/repair shop. When we get phones in for repair, we tell them up front the turnaround time is about an hour and a half to two hours. We especially emphasize this to the people that drop off ~2 before close. 

So, today was a decent day and we actually managed to get the store closed out by the time we closed at 7. Both registers counted and turned off for the night, trash taken out, everything cleaned for the night, money on it's way to the safe. Our store phones automatically send calls to voicemail starting at 7, and one call tonight just managed to sneak by by all of 5 seconds, so I did the kind thing and picked up.

This is how that went:

Caller: ""Y'all close at 7, right?""   
Me: ""Yes, we close at 7 and we are technically closed for the night.""  
Caller: ""Well I dropped my phone off for repair.""  
Me: -checks name- ""Yep, I do have the phone right here, repaired and ready for pick-up in the morning as our registers are already closed for the night and with how the repair system works, they do have to be rung through the register.""  
Caller: ""WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME EARLIER. I LIVE THIRTY MINUTES AWAY. I HAVE WORK IN THE MORNING. I NEED MY PHONE TONIGHT.""  
Me: ""I'm sorry, our registers are closed for the night. I was also present when you dropped the phone off and did hear the associate let you know that the repair would be completed sometime between 6:30 and 6:45 and to be in the area around then.""  
Caller: -yelling to someone in the background- ""AND NOW SHE'S ACTING LIKE SHE DOESN'T EVEN CARE AND YOU KNOW DAMN WELL SHE'D BE DOING EVERYTHING TO GET HER PHONE BACK.""  Then to me: ""Y'ALL ONLY CALLED ME TEN MINUTES AGO, I DON'T LIVE TEN MINUTES AWAY. YOU NEED TO OPEN THE REGISTERS BACK UP. I HAVE THE CASH I CAN JUST GIVE IT TO YOU.""  
Me: ""I did also check with the technician and it looks like according to our records, we reached out to you around 6:00 tonight. I'm very sorry you're not able to pick it up tonight.""  
Caller ""I NEED YOUR MANAGER OR SOMETHING.""  
Me: 😈 ""I am the manager. I've let you know what options you have, but unfortunately I can't open the registers and store back up.""   
Caller: ""I'M LEAVING Y'ALL A ONE STAR REVIEW AND I'M NEVER COMING BACK TO Y'ALL AGAIN.""

For those unfamiliar with Country Concert, it's a huge music concert with events spread out over four days  with big names like Larry the Cable Guy occasionally performing. As you may have guessed, its *the* big event of the year. On top of that, our newest corporate overlords decided that was going to be the same weekend they took over, rebooted our systems, pumps, et. al. making any already tedious weekend much, much worse.

Roughly two hours before the end of my shift, I was seriously considering offing myself and taking the station with me when an elderly woman walked through the doors. Turns one of the people who had threatened to kill me earlier was her son and she wanted to reassure me that that was not how he was raised, especially as she herself used to work retail in her youth. 

She then slid sixty dollars over the counter and told me how a customer had helped her after a really bad day and she wanted to pass on the favor. Without thinking, I asked if a customer really gave her sixty dollars. She laughed and clarified the man had ""given"" her a spectacular night but felt she was a little too old for me  and opted for cash instead.

I used to work as an attendant for the largest gas station company in my country. At the time I'd been working there for about two and a half years. The job itself was actually really enjoyable and I loved my time there. Currently I am working at the same company as a recruiter and whenever I am offered shifts as an attendant, I always accept them.

On to the story. I was finishing up one of my last shifts as an attendant. Cleaning the oven, doing the dishes, mopping the floor etc. When a Russian speaking man came in and wanted to fill up his truck. I tried my best to tell him, in my broken Russian, that we are a fill-first-pay-after type of gas station. And with the help of a regular customer we managed to get the point across.

He then went and filled up his truck, the total was about 350L (approx. 92,5 gallons). It was an hour until the end of my shift, when he came in to pay. After entering the PIN for his debit card, the terminal gave an error. After two more unsuccesful tries, I decided to contact our in-house IT team. Turns out his bank did not have a contract with our service provider hence he couldn't pay with his card. All that time the regular stayed there and helped me as a translator.

By that point I was all out of ideas, had the regular tell him to wait a bit util I could get ahold of my Station Manager. Unfortunately she didn't answer the phone. So I decided to call the Regional Manager. She advised me to call the Head of External Partnerships, since he has more experience in dealing with foreign banks. Unfortunately that was a dead end, because he hadn't even heard of the customers bank. So off I go calling the Regional Manager once again. 

Meanwhile the truck driver had called the owner of his company and told him about the whole ordeal. The owner requested to speak to me. Thankfully he spoke a bit of English and asked me if there's a way to bill them and have the charge paid via a bank transfer. That lit a bulb in my head - we have a debt certificate form we can fill, which basically says that the customer agrees to the charge and agrees to pay it by a certain date. 

As I was finishing up filling the forms, my Station Manager called me back and after explaining her the whole story, she told me to call the Head of Security at our company. He on the other hand told me that the debt certificate was a bad idea, since the company and the driver were from Poland and if they decided to not pay, it would be too expensive to seek legal action. He also asked me why I hadn't just told him to use a nearby ATM to just retrieve the cash from his card. I literally facepalmed in front of the customer - how had I missed the simplest solution to the problem at hand.

Had the regular tell the truck driver to follow me and I drove him to the ATM. The driver successfully retrieved the cash. While driving back we chatted a bit, as much as I could atleast. He boasted to me how his boss had wired him so much money for the trip, that he could buy three cars just like mine with it. He also told me that the first thing he'll do when he gets back to Poland, will be to go to his back and make them sign a deal with our company's provider. When we made it back, the regular had gone, truck driver paid for his fuel and all was well.

I gave both the regular customer and the truck driver a free coffee and a pastry of their choice for the inconvenience. In the end I had spent almost 3 hours and made a dozen or so phonecalls to help the customer. Thankfully the truck driver was understanding the whole time and didn't make a fuss about the whole ordeal.

For safety issues, our restrooms are for employee use only, locked with a keypad. This change happened the first week I started working there so I never really asked any questions. We are literally a 30 second walk to several other stores that do have public restrooms. 

me: “hi, is there anything you need help with?”

customer: “I have been driving all day.. and I really need to use the restroom.”

(he put extra emphasis on the “all day” part and I could tell that he already knew our restrooms are not public but he was trying to make me feel bad for him.)

me: “oh I’m sorry, we don’t have public restrooms, but [insert closest store name] right next door does.”

(awkward silence for a moment)

me: “is there anything else I can help you with?”

customer: “where’s the cat food?”

me: “the next few isles in that direction are all cat food!”

the next half hour includes him grabbing a single bag of cat food and then proceeding to walk around and have the exact same conversation with all of my coworkers. every. single. one. he’s yelling about how he’s been driving all day and needs a restroom immediately. interesting, you could have gone 20 minutes ago to the one next door.

he comes back to the isle I’m working in and meanders around a bit.

me: “is there something else I can help you with?”

customer: “what I need help with is that i’ve been driving all day to get stuff from your store and I just need to use the restroom!”

(he had a very common brand of food in his hand that can be found in most grocery stores)

me: “I’m so sorry there is nothing I can do about that.”

he storms off yelling over the fact that he’s spending money so he should get to use the restroom. He’s not the first one that’s angry either.

The workday went well enough until an hour before my shift ended when a female customer record scratched my day. I can't exactly call her a Karen per se, but she was close. I'll call her Amanda (never met one I liked. No offense to the other Amandas out there, just stating a fact).

Anyway, I do the usual ""Hello, how are you?"" and scanned her items. A tiny bag of washers (a buck and change) and a small paper bag with two cut keys inside (just under 3 bucks each).

Me: ""$7.38 is your total. Would you like a bag for your items?""

Amanda: \*stares at me like I just sneezed in my hands\* ""OF COURSE I want a bag. Why would you ask me that?""

Me: ""Oh, well, you only have a couple little items and sometimes people don't want a bag for those. Some people say no, that's why I ask in advance.""

Amanda: \*snobby scoff and eye roll...seriously, she rolled her eyes at me\* ""Well, I'm not one of those people and I want a bag. Why even ask? Save your breath and do your job.""

I had to bite my tongue because that's EXACTLY what I'd been doing. While she's muttering under her breath, the prompt on the pinpad asking if the customer wanted an eReceipt came up. Her email was on the screen too. Rather than get her more annoyed, I just waited for her to notice it while she was aggressively putting her wallet away and pulling out her phone. This took maybe all of fifteen seconds.

Amanda: \*looks at me and scoffs again, raises her voice\* ""What, are you keeping my receipt now?! I need it in case these keys don't work. Give me my goddamn receipt so I can go! I have more important things to do than waste my time with you. Blah blah blah get a real job blah blah blah manager blah freaking blah...""

She taps ""no"" and her receipt prints out. I give a huge smile (I'm wearing a mask but have large cheeks so it's easy to tell I'm smiling) and waved at her. I heard her, not so quietly, call me a female dog on her way out, just as I shrugged and sipped from my water canteen.

By some twist of fate, the head cashier said she found Amanda's receipt on the floor, saying she saw her drop it on her way out. Amanda was, in the head cashier's words, ""stomping out the door"" and ignored the head cashier trying to get her attention.

I told her everything that happened, including the female dog comment on her way out. As soon as I said that part, the head cashier wordlessly proceeded to shred the receipt into confetti and sprinkled it into two separate trash bins.",0,1634788416

164,"Customers who want things that don’t exist (or, a guy refuses to listen when I tell him what he’s actually looking for)","I’m a manager in the plumbing department of a large midwest home improvement chain. Now, I’m by no means a plumber, nor have I been trained extensively in that trade, but I’ve picked up things along the way and know how to research in order to help people find solutions to their problems. Most of the time, I’m working with contractors and other tradesmen who just need to be pointed in the right direction or are having trouble finding a part amongst the hundreds of fitting bins. For fashion items (showers, faucets, things that are more “emotional” purchases than anything else), I stand by while the customer talks themselves into what option they want. 



Every so often, I’ll have a person come in who has done just barely enough research to have an inkling of what they want/need, but in truth they have no idea what they are talking about or asking for. Unfortunately, this population of people also tends to be the type to have no desire to listen to me or be told that what they think they want does not exist. This story is about one of those guys.


He called the department yesterday about a 1HP deep well pump, and whether we had one in stock. Deep well pumps, also called submersible well pumps, are all, well, SUBMERSIBLE. We also carry shallow well pumps that can be converted to deep well applications with an optional conversion kit that we also had in stock. The team member he spoke with on the phone confirmed that we did indeed have deep well pumps, and so the man made the trek in to make his purchase. When he arrived, he took one look at our deep well pumps and claimed that we had lied to him, as he needed a deep well pump that was NOT submersible. I showed him the convertible shallow well pumps, but that of course was also not he was looking for because he needed it for a DEEP well, not SHALLOW.


After going back and forth several times about how these were his only two options, he called me an idiot and left. At this point, I had no desire to help him, and thought that this would be the end of it.


But of course not. He came back wandering up to my desk again today, asking if there was anyone else working in the department aside from me. I was the opening manager, and it was still too early for any of the regular team members to have arrived. We only have one team member who is very knowledgeable anyway, the rest are teenagers or young adults who would have passed him along to me anyway for assistance. The only other person there was my morning stocker (we’ll call him John). John is an older man who does know a bit more about plumbing than I do, but he wasn’t going to be able to make a non-submersible deep well appear out of thin air. I explained to John what the man was looking for, and we both led him over to the well systems.


Sometimes, customers just don’t want to listen to people younger than them, and will only accept information from older (“more knowledgeable”) employees. I know that I look young, and long ago I gave up on being offended when a customer only accepts an answer from one of my older guys even if I had just told them the exact same thing. I was hoping that would be the case with this customer, mostly because I didn’t want to deal with him anymore but also because I felt bad that he had been without water for over a week now. 


Our stock had not changed in the slightest of course, so the customer was not happy when we still could not show him what he wanted. John attempted to explain, again, his two options of either buying a submersible pump or converting a shallow pump. No dice. The customer asked if we had any special order options of what he wanted. In the 30 seconds it took for us to walk back to the desk, the customer looked up on the store website and found what he thought was a non-submersible deep well pump. I quickly brought the same item up on my computer.


“Sir, I know this says deep well pump, but it’s actually a convertible shallow pump. We have one just like it on the shelf that we showed you earlier. You’d still have to purchase a conversion kit for this to work.”


“But it says deep well in the name! I don’t get  what is so hard for you guys to understand when I say I need a non-submersible pump! I’ve been all over the place and everyone tells me that they have deep well pumps in stock, but when I get there they don’t have it.”


At this point, the customer huffs off before John or I can say anything else. John just looks at me and shrugs before walking away to continue stocking. In one last bid to convince the customer of what we had told him, I go into the department training program and pull up the pump packet. I print out the two information pages on well pumps and walk down to the registers in hopes of catching up with the up with the customer but he is already long gone.


Oh well. Maybe he’ll be back tomorrow.",0,1634771299
165,"Customer wanted a 6-inch length of hose, so I got him one","I used to work for an automotive parts retailer. One of the things we sold was different diameters of rubber hose, priced by the foot. You can buy however much or little you want, but the minimum price will be that of one foot.

Customer (C) comes to my counter and asks for 6 inches of hose in x diameter.

C: ""How much does that cost?""

Me: ""I'll have to ring it up to get the exact price, but I think it's a dollar or two plus tax.""

C: ""Ok""

I went in the back, cut the hose, and brought it back to the front. I rang it up, and it came up as $1.99 per foot.

Me: ""Okay, so the exact price on this is $1.99 per foot. It's priced by the foot, so your cost will be $1.99 plus tax.""

C: ""YOU SAID IT WAS A DOLLAR .02!""

Me: ""I said it was a dollar *or* two."" (that one's on me, I shouldn't have worded it like that)

C: ""How can it be more than a dollar if it's $1.99 per foot and I'm only getting 6 inches anyway? I want to see the manager!""

Manager (the coolest guy ever - we'll call him M) goes through the whole thing again with the customer. The customer eventually gives in and just buys the hose at the correct price. He then states that he's going to call corporate on us.

C: ""What's your name?""

M: ""M.""

C: ""What's your last name?""

M: ""M.""

C: ""What's your full name?""

M: ""M.""

C: ""M is your full name?""

M: ""My name is M.""

The customer left after that and neither of us ever heard another thing about it. ""M"" was the coolest manager I've ever had. I always liked him but after that day, I knew he had my back.",0,1634770445

167,‘Your 16” saw chains are the wrong size’,"I worked in DIY for most of my career. The bulk of that was spent at a hardware chain that no longer exists for the most part, but these stores were everywhere 10-15 years ago. One of the types of items we sold were replacement chains for chain saws. They are sized to fit specific models, and nothing else. We carried 3 or 4 different 16” saw chains. 

Enter customer, who is by now complaining that ‘your 16 inch chain isn’t 16 inches, because it didn’t fit mah saw!’, and that, ‘I’m going to open all your packages and measure them.’ 

I tried to explain the reality of the situation but he wasn’t having any of that. The discourse rapidly turned into an argument, and I told him firmly he wasn’t going to be opening our saw chains today. Imagine wrestling an oily metal snake with sharp teeth everywhere back into the small package. Truly no fun. 

This man just couldn’t understand how a 16” chain isn’t a universal part. I finally told him, ‘Can you put a Ford carburetor on a Chevy engine?’

173,Trolley boy coming dangerously close to killing two girls,"Guess I'll start by talking about my role. For three years I worked at one of the big supermarket chains in oz, in one of the biggest shopping centers for my state. Before quitting, I was one of the trolley boys and would drive around in a Ford courier and trailer to collect the trolleys from all the car parks. On a busy day I could be stuck for 20 minutes in one car park waiting to travel several hundred meters to drop off 36 trolleys that are immediately snapped up by angry shoppers waiting for one, then I get to do it all again, yay...

Anyway, I could go on about some dumb, dumb, DUMB customers, but I digress. When I first started this job I thought it was great. Probably there for a month or two before having one of the scariest experiences. This was on a weeknight doing the usual run. Driving through the bus depot area of the block, going a little under the speed limit, I kept my eyes focused on the road while glancing off to make sure if any busses were about to pull out on the road. All seemed fine, but next moment two girls charged out in the middle of the road, directly in front of the car, where they froze up. It's like that that saying, 'a deer in headlights'. I mean seriously, these two girls saw how close I was to hitting, stopped running, then literally hugged each other, as if they thought they were about to die. I only had a split second to react – so I slammed on the breaks while swerving to the next lane. Reminding you, this is all while having a trailer hooked on the back. Was probably going 50kms and knew I couldn't slow down in time. Probably two of the dumbest people I've had to interact with at that job. I've told a few about that incident, and the reactions I've gotten has been whack. I trained up one guy several months before leaving, and he basically said he wouldn't care if he killed them because it was there fault. Told mum about it and she said, I quote ""silly strays.""

178,Showing up early before your order is ready," 

So once upon a time I worked in a printing store and surprisingly customers who want copies of documents can be jerks, this is the most interesting stories I have about said type of customer. So one day a customer came in during our rush hour with a huge stack of papers, and wants one copy of each and there are a decent amount of papers of all different sizes ( you have to change the settings and type of paper when this happens. we say okay, come back in 2hrs and it should be done . (2 hours to get threw the rush) customer says okay and makes us promise that they should be done by then.

A hour goes by, the rush has calmed down and one employee has gotten a start on the copies, the customer comes back in and ask if his copies are done we say no were still working on them, he demands to know when they will be done, we inform him he's technically early and that they should be done within the next hour. He demands them now and starts yelling at the employee working on them. The manager steps in and tries to calm him down. He starts going off about how he has trust issues and that this is why you cant take anyone's word on anything anymore. He starts trying to back the manager into a corner of the store and starts talking about how he knows people and how he use to be a pilot and starts getting aggressive. So we threaten to call the cops.

At this point we decide to just not finish his print job and give him back the originals and sheared his copies. He gets big mad and says he's never coming back and were all happy to hear that.

about 15 minutes go by and we get a phone call its the customer saying we forgot one of his original documents, so I look around the counter and assure him we retuned them to him, and that we double checked that we did, he gets pissed on the phone and hangs up.

another 15 minutes goes by he calls again says he doubled checked his documents and he's sure something is missing. In the background you could hear him speeding and his tires screeching as he yells about his copies. I offer to transfer him to the manager and he hangs up.

another 15 minutes goes by and he calls again this time the manager answers the phone the customer is just screaming at this point. ""YOU FORGOT MY COPIES AAAGGGGGHHHH AAAAGGGGH AGGGHHHHH YOU FORGOT MY COPIES AGHHHH"" click. the manager hangs up the phone. at this point were pretty sure he's likely coming back up to the store. The manager goes in the back to figure out what to do, and another 15 minutes comes around and there is no call, but I sense something is about to happen.

So I decide to take a 15 minute bathroom break. When I come out the bathroom, there he is up at the front of the counter demanding his lost documents. when I come out the bathroom and see him I kind of duck behind a store shelf, at the same time the manager was also coming out from the back and also ducked behind a store shelf. The associate that was up at the front of the store also ducked down behind a printer. After a moment we were all like well guess we got to at least go talk to him.

So me and the manager walk up and he's yelling about talking to me and how his copies were not made on time, I remind him that he came in early and he refuses to leave the store until he gets his copies and we call the police, the customer rants and raves that this is what's wrong with America and why you cant trust people. The cops show up and escort the man out and tell him he's banned from the store he does not leave quietly.",0,1634621661

183,"Why do you have your card information in an app, pulled up on your phone, and expecting a cashier to just enter it into the computer...?","Hello there, Reddit! My, it's been a while since I posted here, but I have a good story or two to share here, and thought that they would be worthy of entertaining or otherwise distracting you.

For some context, I work in a hardware store in North Carolina as a sales associate. Translation: your everyday soul-sucked drone that comes in only to count the hours to when she can finally catch the bus home. This happened to me on Saturday during my mid-day shift while I was on register. I had this one older gentleman come up to my register to pay for a set of screws that came up to under $8.

To be fair, this man said to me that his card information was on his phone. To me, I was thinking things like, ""it's probably just mobile pay"" and ""ok....why is he telling me this"". Anyway, I quickly rang him up and told him his total. This is where it goes from a somewhat normal transaction to a transaction that makes me question how this dude was able to just get by in life. 

He pulled up his credit card information. On his phone. Possibly in view of other customers.

I told him that I couldn't accept this payment and asked if he had anything else to pay with, and even if he had mobile pay. He said no, his wallet was in his other car. I basically told him that I cannot accept his payment then. I had not explained to him why, and while I should have, I would think that it's pretty self-explanatory why. For those who don't know, some stores will not manually key in your credit card information because A) (from my understanding) It's illegal for us to take you sensitive information and store it in our system and B) it's literally store policy that we cannot do that as we also do not know if this is a fraudulent or stolen credit card, or if the person is just that inept.

Anyway, I suspended his transaction and he left. I mentally make a note to put his stuff away before I left, as 90% of the time the customer never came back to purchase their items.  

Later on, he came back and purchased his screw set.....with cash. 

I will never understand why he wanted me to make one form of payment work when he had another one ready.",0,1634584020
184,Lady tries to steal over $300 worth of stuff,"I work in a really bif retail chain, it finally got slow enough to get off my register last night so I was covering a break standing at the door. The self checkout host noticed when she helped a lady that the lady had a bunch of items in bags that weren't on the check out terminal screen. It's possible that she had a separate receipt but she asked me to check it just incase. Of course I obliged.

Red flag #1: On her way out she got on her phone.  I don't know why but people assume it they are looking at their phone that we won't ask them. So I asked her for her recipt, which she said sure and showed me. 

Red flag #2 she IMMEDIATELY stated that the self check was ""giving her issues when she tried to ring stuff up"" She had probably around 25 items and the receipt only showed about 10 of them. As it's not my job and also recommended to be accusatory, I was nice about the whole thing and so was she. The receipt was hard to read so I was UPC matching all her items and separated about 15 things that were not paid for to which she claimed it was an accident. She said she still wantes to by 3 of the things so I took the rest and told the self check attendant to ring her up on the actual register inside the self check.

As this is about to happen, an assest protection associate just so happens to come through to by a soda, I show him all the stuff I took and said, ""You're gonna want a report, she just tried to leave with all this"".

He immediately stopped her transaction with the self check host and told her she needed to either go with him right now or promptly leave the store. Of course she chose the latter. 

It really didn't look like the stuff would be worth that much but she had a toy that was like $40. About 50$ Worth of clothes she didn't ring up, and she had a kids phone and tablet. The ones that are used for like learning simple things. The total on the items came out to over $300 worth of items.

I was doing my usual work, helping customers finding what they need - the store I work in is huge and part of a world known chain - and just being my friendly and helpful self. When this take place, I was helping a customer using our in store customer screens that can help the customer find where things are on their own. He had never used them before, didn't know how to use them, so I was happily helping him. When there was a natural pause in the conversation, we were interrupted.

Rude customer: ""Where can I find xxxx?""

I turned to the customer interrupting us, having not heard what she asked for.

Me: ""Sorry, but as you see I'm currently helping someone. I'll help you as soon as I'm finished here."" I smile, though I get irritated that she could see I was helping someone and couldn't wait until I was done. I turn back to the customer I was helping, apologizing for the interruption.

Rude customer walks away, but not without sending a few words my way. ""You could just have answered my question instead of being so rude."" She was gone before I could even respond, which probably was for the better, because my usual high tolerance was totally gone at her behavior.

Not a long story, but a reminder that rudeness comes in many shapes. Anyone else hating to be interrupted when you're helping someone else?",0,1634571572
186,Granny Hulk and the Hidden Valley Vitamins,"I was a cashier at an overpriced corner store when I was 16. 

Granny Hulk came to the counter and wanted two bottles of Hidden Valley vitamins, a two liter of diet A&amp;W rootbeer, and a few misc items. She was a pleasant--and a rather tiny--elderly woman and we chatted for a minute, but when I told her the total, she seemed flabbergasted and distressed. 

""But the vitamins are buy one get one free!!!! Can't you read your own signs??""

Hidden Valley vitamins priced $12.99-24.99 WERE on sale that week, but the vitamins she bought up were $29.99 each and unfortunately the ONLY type not included. This come up with another customer I'd had, so I apologized and showed her where it specified the price range of the vitamins included. I even went over with her to the signage (again, since I had checked it earlier) and confirmed it was correct.  

It didn't matter. Nothing I did mattered. She didn't want an explanation, she obviously just wanted the sale applied to what SHE wanted to purchase. Her unholy shrieking got louder and louder until finally a manager came out of the back office from the noise, but it was too late. 

This sweet old woman under five feet tall who had just been telling me about her little dog suddenly transformed into a Banshee of Chaos and hefted the two liter above her head like Hulk throwing a car, and yeeted it right over the counter at my face* while yelling that she was going to our competitor. She rammed the cart into the counter, dropped her own purse and yelled that that was ALSO my fault before devolving into ""I Need an Exorcist"" gibberish as she picked it up and stormed out. My manager had just frozen mid-stride to the counter watching the exchange, and I didn't blame him. 

Little old ladies can be scary, man. 

Tl:dr; Granny Hulk got angry and yeeted a two liter of diet A&amp;W rootbeer at me before going full Exorcise-Me.

187,"We just wanted you all to know, your coworker died. Now get back to work!","Throwaway account because this just happened today so it’s very fresh. We all know cart pushers are severely under appreciated, and they tend to not be noticed by the employees working inside unless they are slacking. So when the carts got low today, management thought the cart pusher was slacking off. However when a greeter went to push the rows of carts up, she found his (already dead and cold) body lying beside the carts. A lower level manager checked his pulse and felt nothing and a nice customer performed CPR while waiting for the ambulance to arrive. He was pronounced dead on arrival to the hospital. At this time, his cause of death is unknown and nobody knows how long he was dead before he was found, but there have been rumors about him having a heart condition. This all happened around noon, and by 2 PM (which is our “zoning time”) management had called all available associates to the lounge. They sat us all down and told us the news and we all said a prayer for the kid’s family (he was about 19 or 20). As soon as we are dismissed, I overheard a manager telling their associates “well its 2 so you need to go zone now” which seemed incredibly insensitive. At noon, immediately after the body was found, management called in the other cart pusher to come in, because god forbid they don’t have a cart pusher, without telling him what happened. As soon as he got there, they told him what happened and the poor guy was bawling. That was a friend of his as they worked together almost everyday. They told him to take 15 then get on pushing the carts because they were low. Mind you, this guy came in two hours early for his shift, just found out his friend died, and he’s also been told they still expect him to get off when he was scheduled to then made it seem like they were doing him a favor because he was going to get overtime when nobody else is allowed to. And the grand gesture to show their appreciation for the cart pushers was to buy them a new cooler for there water which they have literally been begging for FOR MONTHS. To make matters worse, management kind of just went on about the rest of their days like nothing happened. Later I hear from a coworker that nobody was contacted by management to inform them that he was even taken to the hospital. A deli worker who knew his girlfriend had to call her and let her know and the girlfriend had to be the one to tell this poor soul’s family what had happened.

Manager came by, honored the coupon, and she left happy. That was until she read the screen and asked why one of her coupons was voided.

193,The customers who don't care if you're dying...,"I'm currently researching how to retrain to get out of retail- the main reason being I have a disability that prevents me working full time in the retail environment. That's not the point of this post, but another reason is that I'm so sick of having to defer to heartless shitty customers.

My current job isn't so bad (i actually quite like it!) But a previous old job of mine was so bad that I think it left me traumatised.

My old job was at a well known hardware chain, and I recall very early on in my time there, there was a day when a lot of staff were off for the funeral of another member of staff who had passed away just before I started there. I didn't learn how they died until after I'd handed in my notice a few years later.

Before I tell you how this death occurred I should point out that this was a toxic work environment where I was assaulted by customers and frequently (but unofficially) reprimanded for ""conflicts"" with abusive customers...and management gave NO support.

This member of staff suffered a stroke on the premises. The building was a warehouse on the top of a hill and the roof was unable to bear the weight of a helicopter...he urgently needed an air ambulance to take him to hospital. So the staff put out a tannoy announcement urging customers to please return to their cars and vacate the car park so that the air ambulance could land.

Customers started to complain, and it took some time for the car park to be cleared.

The member of staff later passed away in hospital. Now, I'm sure some will say that the customers didn't directly cause his death (although, I worked there, that job could have caused a stroke -_- ), etc etc...but they wasted the precious time that was desperately needed to save this guy's life.

I had actually already made up my mind to leave by the time I was finally told this story, but I was astounded and disgusted...the very woman telling me this story had berated me for being depressed at work, for not laughing off being hit by customers, for being ""too sensitive"" when customers were mean, and yet she gravely told me this story about what horrible *see you next tuesdays* those customers had been.

I was recently reminded of this while at my current job. Now I work for a charity and it's a nicer job all round, and less customer facing. Last week, one of our elderly volunteers fainted and had a fall on the shop floor. We were on the phone to the emergency services, keeping the elderly lady comfortable, didn't move her yes, while we tended to her. (She's ok btw)

Some customers watched on with concern but kept out of the way.

Others were heartless morons.

One tried to interrupt me while I was talking on the phone to get me to serve her (I waved her away and turned away from her. I don't have my previous fears at this job! Go on, just try to complain lol).

A woman edged towards me and said ""can I just step over her?""

Another man started to try and step over her and my colleague and I barked at him to go around.  There was an alternative pathway.

194,"Wait, I have to read the sale?","This happened when I worked at a grocery store in high school. I didn’t check much anymore but it was the weekend before Thanksgiving so all lanes were open. We had a sale on 9” frozen pies and a lady came through with several of the larger 12” pies. As I started scanning them she stopped me to tell me I was over charging her and that these were on sale. Having worked several days in a row I knew it was the smaller ones and explained that to her. She got louder, accused me of being an idiot and insisted I follow her to the pies so she could prove me wrong. I tried to reason with her but she just got louder and louder, and more insistent that I follow her. I figured it would take less time to do that than to continue the discussion so I did just that. When we got to the frozen pies she pointed to the sales tag and gleefully told me I was wrong and that she was right. I pointed out that the sales tags were all over top the 9” pies to the right and not the 12” pies on the left (big chest freezers not the stand up ones”. I also pointed out that all of the tags clearly stated 9” pies. Watching her face go from triumph to embarrassment to anger was pretty satisfying. She next yelled at me “What am I supposed to do, sit here and read the tags to figure out what is on sale and what isn’t?” Yes ma’am, that is how most people do it, and I turned around and walked back to my register.",0,1634482310

202,Unmasked brat contaminates candy,"One night at my job we had some parents and their two unmasked brats, where I work we have firm mask rules that are not negotiable, so my manager started to tell the parents that they had to put masks on their kids  


I wasn't close enough to hear what was said but they were arguing with my manager, apparently complaining about how their youngest has a medical exemption because of asthma (I have severe asthma, if I can handle wearing a mask for an 8 hour shift your brat can wear it for 15 minutes in a store)    


we don't accept medical exemptions in our place, it's just what the owner has decided, and that's his rights as the business owner  


While the parents were arguing with my manager the brats were running wild around the store with not even an attempt from the parents to control their kids, and one was like the definition of a snot nosed brat there was snot like dripping out of his nose.  


So as me and my coworker are watching this from across the store I say to her ""I know we're not supposed to judge but I'm absolutely judging, control your kids""  


Then, it happened.  The unmasked brat \*\*\*LICKED HIS HAND!\*\*\* and shoved it into one of our candy bins, my coworker and I ran over to try and stop him but it was already too late, the brat stuffed the handful of candy he took into his mouth and ran off.  My coworker and I just ended up standing in front of the candy display and wouldn't let anyone touch it until our manager was done arguing with the parents and we were able to tell her what happened.  


She took the whole candy bin and dumped it in the trash and refused to refill it until after it had been to the kitchen and thoroughly cleaned and sanitized (which is absolutely the right decision)

207,"Lady refuses to pay for product she damaged because she ""doesn't need it""","A lady in her 30s came into my store today and asked if we had clear treat bags to put small candies in. We were all out so instead I showed her the only thing we had left on the shelf: a pack of opaque silver foil wrappers for treats, similar to what hershey's kisses are wrapped in. 

She asked me what the difference was between treat bags and foil wrappers and I explained it to her, but she apparently couldn't understand because she then proceeded to ask me FOUR TIMES EACH ""are these see-through?"" and ""are these bags that you can put candy inside?"" She was holding the package of wrappers in her hand, and the palm of her hand was not visible, so I honestly do not know how she was not understanding what the product was. I also explained to her four times that the foil wrappers were not bags, they are individual sheets of paper that you wrap around candy. Every time I answered her same two questions, she followed up with ""but I need something see-through!"" and ""but I need bags!"" We legitimately went in circles for like five minutes until she finally said okay and seemed to understand. I went about my work. 

A few minutes later, I turned down the aisle to put something away and I saw her open the pack of wrappers and try wrapping something in one of them. I was stunned but there was a customer waiting to cash out, so I didn't confront the lady then and there. 

As I was cashing out the other customer, all I could think was ""that lady better be paying for those wrappers when she cashes out,"" but lo and behold, she came up to cash a few minutes later with two products, neither of which were the wrappers. 

So I decided that I was going to try and overcome my confrontation anxiety in the face of this blatant disregard for store rules. The conversation went as follows: 

Me: So, are you buying the wrappers, ma'am? 

Lady: No, they're not what I want. 

Me: Ok but did you open one of the packages? (Giving her an out even though I saw her with my own two eyes) 

Lady: Yes. 

Me (sighing internally): Ok ma'am, I have to charge you for the pack since you opened them. Could you grab the pack you opened please? 

Lady: But they're not what I want! You told me wrong! Those are wrappers, not bags! 

(I was beyond stunned at this point and irritated that she accused me of explaining it wrong to her when we spent five minutes going over the difference) 

Me: No, ma'am I explained to you that those are not clear bags, they are silver wrappers. I think you misunderstood. 

Lady: Well I can't use those wrappers, I need bags! 

Me: You still need to pay for them because now they've been opened and can't be resold. 

Lady: But those are wrappers, not bags! You told me the wrong thing! I can't use them! 

This went on for ANOTHER five minutes until I finally just told her that I would let it go since the wrappers were only $4, but that she's not supposed to open items she doesn't intend to pay for in stores. She seemed a bit apologetic at least and genuinely just confused, not malicious, but holy hell! 

I went into the aisle after she left and found that she had ripped the package open so violently she tore the barcode and then just left it in the wrong spot on the shelf. Unbelievable that people like this exist. 

This was my first day back after a ten day break and it just affirmed to me that I am just so done with retail.

208,Love shopping but hate those pesky retail workers? Here are some sure fire ways to make them miserable!,"1. Is the picture on the box not enough? Do you need to open everything to see exactly how it looks? Instead of opening the box carefully by using the specially crafted mechanisms, why not just rip the top right off? And once you’ve carefully inspected each item take care NOT to put it back in the box, but ensure you’ve left each item in a completely different area of the store!

2.Have you filled your cart full of useful things and just realized you have crippling credit card debt? Just leave the cart and don’t bother to tell anyone you’ve changed your mind! Bonus points if you block an entire aisle with your abandoned merch!

3.Whether you break something by accident or on purpose and blame it on your child, make sure not to alert anyone and slink away to avoid disgrace.

Customer: Closes the phone and says ""sorry for that.""

Me: No worries, how can I help you

Customer: Starts digging her bag and takes out a ceiling lamp socket. ""Do you have two hooks for this socket and the sockets for it?"" (She meant plugs but I understood what she meant)

Me: Unfortunately no but we do have the plugs for those.

Customer starts digging her bag again and doesn't stop anytime soon so I ask her ""so do you want me to bring you the plugs?""

Customer: So do you have the hooks or no?

Me: No unfortunately, but I can bring you the plugs

Customer: Yeah bring me the plugs

Me: So how many do you need?

Customer: *inhales loudly* TWOO

Me: alright. *I bring them to her* Looks about right?

Customer: how should I know you are the worker here not me why should I know

Me: Ok, it's 7€.

Customer pays and I give her the receipt. I didn't say thanks because of how she was acting and she didn't say thanks either.

Customer: You could act nicely and say thanks.

Colleague next to me: thanks

Customer walks away and colleague asks ""what's the matter?""

Me: Just a basic customer.

Customer: *Turns around* ""You can also tell me what you said""

So I got angry and raised my voice telling her to get out already.

Customer: Why you acting like that

Me: Get out already or I'll call the guards in.

Colleague: Wait wait wait pleae come here customer tell me what happened

Customer: Your colleague didn't say thanks and I told him he could say thanks and be nice so idk why he got angry. I work at customer service so I know how he feels he should be ashamed.

Colleague: alright I'm sorry for what happened.

I just ignore her and help another customer. She walks away while looking back.



This is the first time I get angry at a customer to a level I shout at them. Even a colleague said they haven't seen me get angry like that before.

If she worked at customer service she wouldn't have acted like that. I knew she's gonna act like that right when she started shouting at the phone in front of me. Why would she expect me to say thanks when she acts like that. Above all, it was the last 3 minutes before we close.

213,The Battle of Plastic vs Paper Never Ends,"Hello,
Got another fun story that happened a few days ago. I’m 20F, and have been working in a grocery store for 2 years.

So the other day, I was scheduled to check. I don’t get scheduled to check much anymore because I’m trained to do a lot of other stuff in the store, but when it does happen, I enjoy it because it’s the easiest thing I can do imo.

This was pretty early in the morning on a weekday, one of our checkers was on break, so it was just me and one other checker, but we were pretty busy. I had an older guy at my register and he had probably around $50 worth of groceries. As he’s paying, I decide to start bagging his groceries. So I go over and start putting his stuff into plastic bags and putting them into his cart. I only have a few items left when he finished paying. Then this happened…

He walks over to me, his hands in front of him, and he says to me, as if he’s scolding a child, “What part of all paper and no plastic did you not understand?”
I’m completely shocked, because up until this point we were both perfectly polite to each other. I look at him and say, “Excuse me? I didn’t hear you say that” and I start pulling out paper bags. He mumbles something about how we should be “outlawing plastic like they do in the west” and he starts taking his groceries out of the plastic bags, very slowly. To speed things up, and because I was irritated, I start grabbing the plastic bags and taking the stuff out of them very quickly so I can get rid of him and get to the next customer. Then he says, “I don’t mean to make a big deal out of this.” He didn’t even say sorry, which if he did I definitely would’ve forgiven him. I just said “Mhm”, finished bagging his stuff, gave him his receipt, and said “Thank you.” He said nothing and left.

I understand that people like their groceries bagged a certain way (we got a few people who do “paper inside plastic”), but it’s really not that serious. Just a polite “Oh I said paper please” would have worked fine.",0,1634187387

Ok so what happened was a bunch of teens and a few who were likely in their early 20s came into our small grocery store and stole all the mobility scooters and we're jousting with them in the parking lot and in the store and absolutely trashed the back, which was in itself a pain to clean up since we have a Renaissance festival nearby this time of year which swamps us with customers, but what really sucked is after we caught them all and kicked them out the exact moment I started to relax again another employee came running up the the front and told the manager the kids from earlier had trashed the men's restroom as well. See I didnt think this would be to bad when I was immediately sent to clean it but I took one step inside that door and vomited hard. They had covered the entire restroom in SOY SAUCE and no I'm not joking, I mean like up the walls in the toilet and urinal and all over the floor and by the goddess that stuff smelled so bad. Then when I had finished cleaning it all up the same manager who told me to go back there berated me for taking so long even though I told them that I had no experience with legit cleaning supplies ( kinda poor so rags and water were about the jist of it ) which was icing on the crap cake.

221,"Customer Thinks That Because She Wants It, Everyone Else Does Too.","So the story happened a few years ago before Covid. I had been with the store for maybe four years roughly. 
A woman walks in looking for a certain item. I can’t remember what it was, but I told her “I don’t think I keep that kind of item here, but we will head down to where they would be, and take a look.” She was groaning a bit about how she needs the item and hopes we have it. 
So we get down to the aisle, I look around, and don’t see anything like it anywhere. 
So I tell her that we don’t have it, but before I can offer anything else, she says, “Well, I really need it, so I’m gonna have to go somewhere else. But get that item in the store. I’m not the only person who could ever need that.” 
She was being rather snarky when she said that. So I told her the truth, and said, “I’m not going to order it in for stock, because in the so many years I’ve been working here, you’re the only customer who ever asked me for that item.” 
She quiets down a little, and simply gives a defeated “Oh.” And turns and leaves. I shake my head as she walks away. Thinking “Because you need it, doesn’t mean everyone does either. And before anyone asks, I was going to offer to see if the item was stocked by my company, and I would’ve ordered in for her before she got snarky.",0,1633979956

223,Hated my team way more as any customer while working here,"So a few years ago I worked at a small clothing store. Surprisingly, I have little to complain about the customers. But my work team was down right awful. Here is a list of the things they pulled:

1. Didn't teach me how to close down the store for like 1.5 years even though I asked like at least once or twice a month. New hires were taught how to close. They then bullied me for not knowing how to close.
2. I worked many 8-9 hour shifts with often only 2 or less customer coming in, and when I tried to have some small talk to pass the time/boredom of folding the same clothes for hours got asked, ""Do you have any friends at all?"" mind, this was a 30 year old woman with a toddler at home saying this to a 17 year old.
3. My 'manager' was only a manager when she felt like it. Meaning that when I needed her assistance with difficult customers / didn't know how to do something got told that I should have known by know how to deal with these things on my own, but when it was in her favour, i.e. making the schedule, suddenly she was the manager.
4. A coworker of mine stuck me on working the register and helping customer while she tagged the new sale items. She made many mistakes with tagging, like putting things on sale which were not supposed to be on sale. When the manager asked about it, I simply said that I hadn't done that since it hadn't been my task. Got bullied for the rest of my time working there for having said that it wasn't my task. Coworker got off without even a slap on the wrist while having cost the company possibly hundreds of euro's and many man hours fixing her screw up.
5. There had been a mistake with shipping and every code for every clothing article had to be handwritten on the deliverypaper (these were like 12 digit codes, none of which were anywhere close to being the same). My manager tried for an hour and got like 1/5 of the way done before deciding that she'd rather help the customers. I got the rest (4/5) done in like an hour and a half. Manager told me I wasn't fast enough and a lazy employee. Then insulted my handwriting (which was perfectly readable) and told me that I needed to work on that if i ever wanted to graduate collage (?).
6. Saw me writing something and immediately flipped out and demanded to know if i was resigning. I wasn't. Got scolded for doing homework. In the breakroom. During lunchtime. Which was unpaid.
7. Despite point 6, when the store was closing down and on its last days the manager found it necessary to tell me that she had wanted to fire me many times. Got insulted when I told her that I had wanted to quit many times.
8. On black Friday it was a madhouse. I worked the register the whole day and worked the two dress rooms next to the register on my own. Made about 1000-1500 euro's in sale that day. The 4 other employees all worked together on the 5 dress rooms on the other side of the store. They made about 4500-5000 between the 4 of them. Accused me of stealing their sales. Got insulted when I told them that if they had wanted to know their exact sales instead of me guessing who they belonged to (always picking one of those 4, not me), they should have worked the register for their own sales, as was policy. Mind you, I did not steal their sales.
9. After work hours on this black Friday tried to tell my manager about something important. Got interrupted like 4 times by one of my coworkers. Asked her to stop interrupting me so I could tell our manager what she needed to know and go home. Was scolded by five 30-45 year olds for being a bitch.
10. We got a new CD with music to play in the store like every month or so with 12-15 songs. They would never let me change it and I had to listen to the same 3 CD's for like a year before I took the supply closet's key while they were on break and accidentally 'lost' those CD's in random CD sleeves. They got pissed at me for loosing their favorite CD's. I still cant listen to a good 30 or so songs without immediately getting pissed off. I don't even feel the slightest bit of remorse for this one.
11. When closing down the store some info had to be put into the PC. Usually this would take my coworkers up to 45 min. When a new hire caved and taught me how to close, it took me about 5 minutes to get it done. So all of my coworkers basically spent 40 minutes goofing off and sitting on their ass while I was still working every time they closed. For the 1.5 years I worked there.
12. Got in for a evening shift (6-9 pm). Because I always came straight from collage, I always ate in the backroom. On my own time, mind you so before 6. Got told by one of my coworkers to get up and go in despite that it was like 5:45, I hadn't eaten my dinner yet and wasn't on the clock. Coworker told me that's not how things work here and to be a team player. Told her to be a team player and let me eat my dinner in peace and not shove her hours onto me. Got a lecture from the manager about being a bitch. Again.
13. Manager planned me in for 5 pm despite having in my contract that on weekdays I couldn't start  earlier as 6 because I often had class until 5, had 30 min commute to work, and then had to eat. Manager told me that work was important and that I needed to prioritise what was important. I don't know if she actually thought I would throw away my education for a minimum wage job that I didn't really need. Told her she could expect me at 6 or I'd quit on terms of her breaching my contract. She didn't like that and threatened to fire me anyways. Even though the store was desperately short staffed and they couldn't fill the positions because the store was to close down in a few weeks.
14. Always had to start working half an hour before I was actually on the clock. And half an hour after I was off the clock. Didn't get paid for either.
15. Got angry with me when I didn't specifically remember everything that they wanted me to do when opening. While literately every employee (8!) wanted me to do something else every morning. Even if I hadn't worked with them for weeks / months.

These are just a few of the things that made me absolutely hate every single one of that store's employees. I now know that I should have quit that place in a month or during probation, but I was a dumb 17 year old working my first job.",0,1633960262

Most women's dress type shirts are v-neck, and I am rather large chested, so for modesty sake I always wear an undershirt for additional coverage. 

A customer comes over to my department to pick up a special order. I ask her name, look up her order and then grab it from the bins underneath the counter. 

Customer: I can't believe they let you wear that. 

Me: Excuse me? (Me thinking I misunderstood what she just said to me)

&amp;#x200B;

This happened maybe 2 years ago when I was still a cashier at the grocery store I used to work at. This happened so long ago so the numbers are only vague estimates. I also want to point out that we weren't allowed to change prices at all; All price overrides had to be approved by a supervisor or manager. A guy comes up to my register with his groceries, of which is some produce. He had around 10 or so celery root (not 100% sure at this point, but either way it was some low volume produce) that were $1.50 each. When I'm done ringing him up, I tell him his total and this interaction takes place:

&amp;#x200B;

""Why is my total so high?""

&amp;#x200B;

\*Scrolls through the item list\* ""It looks like those celery roots were about $15""

&amp;#x200B;

""Why are they $15?""

&amp;#x200B;

""Because you got 10 of them and they're $1.50 each""

&amp;#x200B;

""Well I don't want to pay that. They're only $0.75 at \*Some other store\*.""

&amp;#x200B;

""Well unfortunately we don't price match sir, and I can't just change the price because you don't like it.""

&amp;#x200B;

He then asks for my manager, to which I oblige. My manager comes over &amp; tells him basically the same thing. He grumbles about it but eventually pays &amp; leaves. An hour or so goes by &amp; I see him come back into the store with the celery root. He heads over to the guest services desk, and i see him talking with my manager and after a few minutes he walks off, celery root still in tow.

&amp;#x200B;

Later in my shift, I ask my manager what happened. She tells me that he called corporate &amp; complained; Corporate said that he could go back to our store &amp; get a refund for the difference (about $7).

228,“Can You Read?”,"Hey good evening r/talesfromretail!  

Just wanted to share this experience I had today at my store. 

I am the Assistant Manager at a store that sells a variety of products. Including but not limited to; tshirts, beer bongs, adult toys, shot glasses, and piercings. I get a lot of customers, of all walks of life and it’s my job to make sure the customers leave happy. 

Not just happy. But safe. 

My entire county that my store is located in is still under a mask order, in where anyone shopping in our stores MUST wear a mask.  

Most people are really cool about it, “Hey guys gotta wear a mask in the store!”  “Oh man I’m sorry” and they’ll put the mask on their face. You can probably tell where this is going. 

Today this couple walked in, both without masks. Of course I stopped and said “hey guys do y’all have masks?”  And both went “no”. 

“Oh that’s okay!  I got some for you!”  And I went and grabbed my package of disposable masks. The girl of the group was totally understanding and put on the mask that I gave for free and as I turned towards the guy to give him one, this happens:

“I’ll do you one better man. Read that.”

And he passes me this little card about the size of a post it note. It looks like [this](https://imgur.com/a/hewVjow).

In complete honesty, I was waiting for this to pop up. 

I looked at it for less than 2 seconds, handed it back to him and just a simple “get out.”

He looked at me in complete shock, and responded with “no you have to read that!”

“I did read that. Get out”

“Can you READ?”

“Yes I can read, and I’m telling you to get out of my store.”

“I’m allowed to shop here!” And he took a step forward like he was about to fight me. 

“No you’re not. Not anymore. I’m denying you service. Get out of my store.”

As he walked away, one of my associates said, “oh have a great day guys!”

Dude responded with “enjoy your muzzles.”  With the nastiest look he could give them. 

I heard through the other store managers around the area that he kept trying in other places and they kept doing the same thing. Kicking him out immediately.

229,“This is false advertising!!!”,"This was about a year and half ago now. I was watching Karen videos and it triggered this memory. For context, I worked in the windows department of a large department store. 

On to the story:

A woman made her way over to the clearance section of our window coverings. She scanned the shelves for a bit until bringing over about 6 of a specific type of curtain. 

I began to ring them in as she watched the total add up.

Karen: “Whoa, your system is wrong. Those are supposed to be $30 each why are they ringing up as $60? There was a sale sign”

Me, with a brief smile and nod: “I can go check that sign with you if you’d like so we can make sure they aren’t ringing incorrectly.”

Karen: With a huff, “Yes.”

We made our way over to the sale sign. It simply stated SALE with a list of three different styles of curtains reduced to $30

Me: “Ah, I see the confusion. This sale only applies to the 1, 2, and 3 style. The one you picked is style 4” (can’t remember the exact names, so I’m just numbering them for this post)

Karen: “I want a manager NOW” 

I radioed my manager over. As soon as he arrived she started to yell

Karen “THIS. IS. FALSE. ADVERTISING. DO YOU SEE THIS? This is RIDICULOUS! I want these reduced to $30 as you are all trying to trick me into getting attached to this curtain and then selling it for MORE money than listed”

He stared in astonishment before gathering his composure and saying, “Ma’am, this is not false advertising. It is clearly listed on the sign which items are discounted to $30, and I know for a fact that the one you picked out is discounted as well. That is a $150 curtain you have in your hands that is now reduced to $60. It is simply not listed on the sign. False advertising would imply that the sign is presenting false information which it is not” 

She ended up just throwing the stuff on the ground and storming out. My manager was defeated, kind of just looked at me like “wtf” and walked away to the back of the store.",0,1633918646

237,"No, we absolutely will not return that","Long time lurker, first time poster. This happened about a year and a half ago.

I worked for a chain adult store, selling things like lingerie, supplements, lube, adult toys, dvds, etc. We had a very strict no return policy for obvious reasons. Not only is that, well, gross, it’s a safety hazard and state law where I live. This is something that every employee tells every customer before cashing them out. It’s also printed at the bottom of the receipt and we would circle that part of the receipt in highlighter so there was no way anyone left without knowing about our no-return policy.

It’s a Friday night, we’re fairly busy around 11pm and everything is going smoothly. In walks Karen holding a vibrator that’s still in the box and the receipt for the item. I already know how this is gonna go, but I greet her and ask what I can do to help. It should be noted that this specific toy doesn’t have a “seal” on the box so there’s no way to know whether or not it was used. Some companies did this because it was our policy to test all of the toys (plug them in to make sure they charge, pop in batteries and turn them on to make sure they work) before someone bought them, that way if there was a defect we could just switch it out right then since we didn’t offer return or exchanges once the product has left the store. I’ll refer to myself as Me and her has K

K: I need to return this
Me: I’m very sorry but we do not offer returns or exchanges on any of our products. Is there something wrong with it? If so it’s probably still covered under the factory warranty.
K: No there’s nothing wrong with it, I bought it last week as a gift for my girlfriend’s birthday but we broke up so I’m not giving it to her
Me: Okay I’m very sorry to hear that, but again I can’t return this item
K: Well why not? I didn’t even use it
Me: I understand that but unfortunately there is no way to know whether or not it was used, and for safety reasons we cannot return it. The employee that sold you the product should have told you that before you purchased it and I’m sorry if that piece of information wasn’t communicated properly. 
K: This is ridiculous. I brought the receipt and everything, see? I only bought it last week
Me: Yes I do understand that, but as you can see at the bottom of your receipt it states that we absolutely do not offer returns or exchanges 
K: I want to speak to your manager 
Me: Alright I’ll get him, but he’s going to tell you the same thing 

At this point I’m annoyed of course, and there are other customers standing around waiting to be helped, so I grab my manager and explain what’s going on. He goes to Karen and tells her the same thing I did.

K: I want a refund! We broke up and I’m not going to use this! I swear I never even opened it!
Manager: I understand your frustration but unfortunately there is nothing we can do. I can offer you a 20% off coupon for your next purchase and I’ll throw in some free lube samples for your trouble 
K: That’s not good enough. I’m going to be calling corporate about this tomorrow and I’m going to tell that how UNHELPFUL all of you were
Manager: Okay, you’re welcome to do that, the corporate number is at the bottom of your receipt.

Karen proceeds to storm out, yelling about poor customer service the whole way out. Idk if she ever called corporate or not, not that it matters because they would have told her the exact same thing. It still baffles me to this day that some people think we can take a (probably used) sex toy back and just put it back on the shelf. Nobody would shop there if that were our policy.

238,Why can’t I use my ripped up receipt for a return?!,"This was about a year ago, but It’s still super vivid in my mind. 

I was working as a cashier at a craft store and a lady comes in to return some fabric. I ask her if she has a receipt, to which she pulled out a receipt that was ripped in 1/2

For me to pull up the transaction I need the bar code on the receipt.  Of course that was not the part of the receipt she kept

Cast 
OP: Me
L: lady
M:Manager 


Op: ma’am do you have the other half of the receipt? 

L: no, i rip them so that they fit in my wallet

Op: okay well I don’t see the fabric on this 1/2 of the receipt so did you possibly pay with card? I can look up the transaction otherwise. 

L: No, I paid cash. I expect cash back since I have the receipt 

Op: ma’am it doesn’t show me on the receipt how much you purchased this fabric for. I can’t help you

L: no your policy says if I have a receipt I can return it

Op: you have …1/2 of the receipt 

L: well how else would I get it to fit in here *shows me the little wallet slot she puts them in. I see other torn up receipts* 

Op: maybe fold them…

L:get me your manager 
At this point she’s whispering under her breath how useless I am..of course, like I’m the one that tore her receipt 

Now my manager has been working here for over 40 years at this location and seems to get a kick out of dumb karens. 

M: sorry I can’t return the fabric without a receipt or a credit card to look it up in. 

L:well..how..

M: Maybe you should fold them instead of rip them in 1/2

L: excuse me? But your return policy states…

M: yeah and for that to happen you need the full receipt. We don’t even know you bought the fabric from here. 

L:*starts opening the folded fabric to try and see if there is our logo or something on the seamed edge which has ANOTHER fabric stores name on it. 

M:see that’s why we need the full receipt this isn’t even our fabric. This is store XXXXX

L: *scoffs* well hopefully they will do a better job at returns then YOU GUYS

M: not if you only have 1/2 the receipt they won’t.

240,"Lady, if you've got a problem with the radio, go away.","I spend some time working in my family's business, a gift shop, toys, books, stuff like that. The other day it was fairly quiet but I was busy with stuff to do myself. I was wrapping books, cleaning, etc. Two or three other people were there looking around, one of them, a woman of about 30. She spent about half an hour browsing around and while I was walking around, I have only realized now in hindsight, she was looking right at me frequently like she was dropping a hint about what was playing on the radio. I was literally so occupied my mind was elsewhere that I wasn't even listening to it. She then comes to pay for something small, which might just have been bought only so she had something to break the ice. She essentially says what they are talking about on the radio is a bit insensitive for a kids' shop, what if there are children walking around hearing that, etc. 

Now to be fair, she wasn't rude about it, but I really did not know what she was expecting me to do, so I said ""Thanks for letting me know, I didn't even notice, I've been so busy here.""  I also ask what it is they're talking about, apparently, it's someone mourning a family member, talking about their life, etc, I pay attention myself and the details don't seem graphic or anything, it's more about bereavement. But even after I said that she was still looking at me like I was supposed to do something. WHAT? Again, she goes on about essentially what's been discussed on the radio in a kids' shop, children could be listening to that. By now I'm feeling fairly uncomfortable, am I supposed to get on my knees and beg for forgiveness or what?

As I was checking this lady out she asked can I have discount? 
For no reason?? Like why would I just give you a discount for no reason. The audacity of some people lol. 
I said no sorry, there aren’t any discount for these but we have discounts on these (other bracelets by a different brand) and she was like no I want that discount for these bracelets.
Lady that’s not how discounts work wtf. You don’t go into a chain store and ask the cashier for a discount on stuff that isn’t marked down why do it at a small business?? But of course I just politely said I’m sorry, I’m afraid we can’t do that. 

Then as I was bagging her stuff she stepped around the cash desk into what is obviously a staff only zone and told me she didn’t want our regular paper bags. No, she wanted nice cloth gift bags. I told her this brand she got did not provide us with packaging, &amp; these cloth bags are for a different brand. The branding is obviously marked on the bags. She’s like give me those. And I’m like I can wrap it really nicely for you in tissue and give you an extra paper bag if you need. And she’s like no I want the cloth bags. 
I’m very non confrontational so I gave them to her to get her out of my face. But I feel bad cause it’s like “stealing” from the other brand. I know packaging is but a small cost but these brands are all very small businesses, I know a lot of them personally and we are all humans hustling to make a living from our craft. and a cost is still a cost.

247,You should have explained why I am late better!,"I used to work in a store that sold glasses and also did sight tests. 

I was working the reception desk one day and this lady comes in with four kids and a cast on her leg. She tells me that she has appointments booked for all four children. 

So I check the system and see that she's actually about a half hour late. Each appointment is only allotted a 15 minute slot on a rolling basis. So if one appointment starts late, every appointment after that is also going to be late. 

She had the four kids booked in one after the other, but because she was a half hour late, they had essentially missed the first two appointments. 

I relayed all of this information to her and said that she would be able to see two of the kids, but that we didn't have time to see all four as the first two appointments had been missed. 

I'll now refer to myself as M and her as C for customer, the discussion goes roughly as follows;

C: well, it isn't my fault I'm late, the bus was late. 

M: I understand, but unfortunately those first two slots have been missed.

C: Can't you just squeeze them in??

M: I'm sorry, but unfortunately not. There are no more open slots this afternoon. 

C: Why can't they just see all four of them in 30 minutes!? 

M: 30 minutes will not be enough time to adequately perform all four tests, I'm afraid. 

C: *stands there huffing and looking annoyed*

M: I am sorry to rush you, but I need to know if you still wish to keep the other appointments, as you are now beginning to run late for those as well. 

C: Oh this is ridiculous! Why would I want to have appointments for only two of them!? What's the point in that!? 

M: Ok, should I just go ahead and cancel the other two then? 

C: No, no! Can you not call upstairs and tell them it isn't my fault I'm late and see if they can see all of them?? 

M: Ma'am, I can call upstairs if it would make you feel better, but they are going to say the same thing. 

C: Just do it!

Just for context, the appointments were done on the first floor of the building, currently we were on the ground floor. Once I had checked people in we would send them upstairs.

So I called up, basically explained that this lady was 30 minutes late but wanted to know if there was any way we could fit in all four kids. As expected, they checked the system and told me the exact same thing...no other slots available, we could only fit in two (by now probably only one) of the four kids. 

Once I got off the phone I told her the result of the discussion and she went mad. 

C: Oh my god, you didn't even tell them it wasn't my fault. You didn't tell them the bus was late and you didn't tell them about this! *gestures to leg in cast* it took me longer than usual to get here, that isn't my fault! You don't even want to help me! I won't be coming back here again! 

Then she stormed out, slowly because of the cast, with her kids in tow. 

I mean, I will never understand people who take so little responsibility for themselves. This woman managed to plop four kids out of her but can't accept that if she is walking slower because of a cast then she should have maybe planned ahead that it might take her longer to get places. 

Also, if you are late for your appointment, we don't care whose fault it is, I cannot change time! It isn't a personal slight against you when we tell you that you're late! It is a very simple and basic fact! I don't need intimate details about your life and all the reasons you are late...it is irrelevant. If you're late, you're late. All I care about at that point is whether I can fit you in or not. 

And, whoever's fault you think it is that you're late...I don't care about that either, it certainly isn't mine.",0,1633766817

She requests to speak to the highest available manager.   There about 5 I could have chosen from that day, but I’ve learned how to field some of these calls to keep them off my boss’s desk which she appreciates.

At this point I have to stop and think.  WTF.  Do I even have a cashier that would find that amusing?  No.   No.   Wait a minute…

Me: “Ma’am.  Did we check your ID?”

I told her she needed to purchase 3 items with a total of at least $60, she agreed.

This large makeup store has an AMAZINGLY generous return policy:

IF you're a member you have 90 with or without the receipt or packaging as long as its not more than 20% used.

253,You want me to risk jail for a $7 bribe.,"I've been helping out at a friends private game store the past few weeks in my spare time because they recently fired 2 of their staff that were caught pocketing money from bogus returns. The ""Customers"" would return items that weren't bought here and give the employees a cut of the return. Both were arrested. Games were taken for evidence, likely stolen.

Policy has always been returns require a reciept in any circumstance. The 2 employees would print out the receipts a few days prior and later the ""Customers"" would use them to return the product bought elsewhere. Old register, didn't have a new computer system that kept track of the reciepts. It has since been replaced with a new system and new cameras.

Yesterday while I was minding the counter I had a few customers come in with returns and the old register receipts. Both couples, both trying to return games that were still in the plastic/not opened. After checking the receipts I noticed that they were dated for Sept 17th. They were trying to return FIFA 22. In my area  FIFA 22 was released on October 1st. I knew they were part of the crew of bogus returns. I probably should have called the police but as I didn't have solid proof and I was currently alone, I decided just denying them was best.

Both couples of course didn't feel this way. A fair amount of yelling, cussing, blaming, threatening lawsuits and eventually trying to bribe me with $7 per game. I asked for a contact number so my friend (the owner) may be able to come to an arrangement (with the police).
As I picked up the phone in the back for a moment, they quickly left. They spooked after I asked for their contact info. Cameras show nothing else was taken, and the neighbors building caught their license plates.

We had a nice flower corner with plants and flowers close by that sold well. We had some really nice daisy bushels.

Yet it was about to change. Not because of a Karen or Ken but because two men decided to do something naughty and ruin their own days.

It all started with me seeing my manager pacing behind the cash registers. Curiousity got the best of me and I decided to ask what was going on.   
The conclusion: Two men were in the hygiene and personal care department and stuffing every pocket they had with expensive tootpaste and facial creams. When their pockets were full things went down their underwear. (yuk, yuk, yuk)  


They were caught and brought back to the office of the manager. Excitement was rife along the employees.  
 Important detail. The manager's office was after the cash registers and had no obstacles to the exit of the supermarket. You passed by the service desk and the flower corner.   


So the two thieves were in the office. The moment the manager picked up the phone to call the police they bolted out of the office for the exit when....

One of them was bodyslammed by one bulky male cashier (MC) right into the daisybushels. MC managed to get on the back of thief # 1 and started to elbow his back all the while screaming to him 'Stay down, stay down'.  From my front row seat at the service desk I skipped towarts MC and asked if he was all right. He confirmed shorty and then continued to scream 'Stay down!' at thief #1.  
 Thief #2 was pushed into the rows of carts by a co- worker who was training to be a police officer and an off duty officer. He was  whimpering a bit and not looking happy at all.  


With everything under control I skipped to the manager who was looking a bit non plussed and told him everything was under control. Not long after the thieves got some shiny new bracelets and a free ride.

Then the least fun bit. I had to scan every item they tried to steal under the 'stolen code'. Before I started with that I found a box of latex gloves before I even contemplated touching the goods the thieves tried to steal.

And that is the story how one thief met up with some daisybushes up close.",0,1633515031
266,Sandwich Kiosk Rage!,"Okay so at the gas station I work at we have a subshop, and late last year we installed a couple of kiosks for people to order from, and thus Kiosk Rage has come to our store! Let me break down how they work, the customer touches the screen, puts in their first and last name, then places their order. The buttons are literally pictures of the different ingredients with the names of said ingredients under them. Now, if you have 2 brain cells to rub together, this is a simple enough process to figure out, but who are we kidding here? EVERY DAY since December, we've had people losing their minds! ""Why does it need my name?"" ""I can't work this fucking thing!"" ""Why can't you just take my order?"" I could understand if the things glitched out, but honestly they're the best running system we have in the entire store! It's literally pictures!",0,1633506187
267,Old lady wants the chicken,removed_asdf_fix,0,1633497645
268,"""Enough is enough!""","So, this happened earlier today.

I work at a Pet Supply Store. Shortly after starting my shift this morning, we got a call from a lady asking if we carry ""The flea stuff with the plus?"" I ask if she means Frontline Plus, she confirms that yes, that's it, and she wants it for her cats. She asks if it's okay for kittens. I tell her we've got it, and it's okay for kittens over 8 weeks. She says kitten is 11 weeks, and she'll come in to buy it. Okay, cool. I continue my shift as normal.

A few hours later, a lady walks in asking for the Frontline Plus for cats.

**ME:** \[Donning my Chipper Retail Persona\] Oh, are you the one who called about it earlier?

**LADY:** Yes, that's me!

**ME:** Oh, I took your call! Let me get the keys for the case and I'll grab it for you.

I go get the keys and get her a box of the Frontline.

**ME:** Here's the Frontline! Right here on the back it says it's safe to use on kittens over 8 weeks and 1.5lbs.

**LADY:** \[Sounding a bit snippy\] Well, hold on! Give me a second! \[Pulling glasses out of her purse\]

**ME:** \[Thinking, *Oh, she must need her glasses to read*\] No problem, take your time!

**LADY:** \[Putting on glasses\] My friend killed her cat using some flea stuff that she wasn't supposed to.

**ME:** \[Thinking, *Oh my fucking god, poor cat!!*\] I'm sorry to hear that. There's definitely flea stuff that, while safe for dogs, is highly toxic to cats. 

**LADY:** Well, I have a kitten. She brought the fleas to the two older cats. What do I use?

**ME:** Well, like I said, the Frontline is safe for kittens over 8 weeks. You said she was 11 weeks, right?

**LADY:** I don't want to give her that. I don't want to give her anything too strong.

**ME:** \[Thinking, *alright then.*\] If you'd like, I can help you find a different product that would be safe to use on cats, and on kittens.

**LADY:** Well I'm getting that for the cats. I don't want it for the kitten.

**ME:** Okay, we should have another product or two that's safe for kittens if you want something different. \[I move over to look at a spray, reading the label to myself. It's not appropriate for the kitten\] Hmm, this one says kittens over 12 weeks, so she's still a little young. 

I picked up another spray next to it. At this point, I notice her pick up a spray that clearly has a Golden Retriever on it and says it's for dogs. 

**ME:** Oh, that one is specifically--

**LADY:** Alright, enough is enough! Stop it! Leave me alone! I don't want to hear it, stop trying to sell me things! Leave! Me! ALONE.

I promptly and quietly fucked off, shaking slightly.

I don't know what the *fuck* happened there. I was being polite and helpful, and she just went off on me. It was a weird fucking moment. I was *pissed* because *hey lady, I'm just trying to* ***keep you from killing your fucking cats****, like your friend apparently did.*

I left the Frontline at the counter. One of my managers rung her up. I didn't see what else the lady bought, and I wasn't going to ask. 3 of 4 managers were on today, and I got the chance to tell 2 of them about the interaction after the lady left. The first one I told had heard part of the conversation, but missed the weird blow-up. It was a fucking bizarre interaction.

I hope she doesn't kill her poor cats because she wanted to be a bitch. Like, you *went out of your way to mention that your friend killed her cat* ***using the wrong flea product***. I would *think* making sure you buy the *appropriate* treatment would matter to her? Like, I understand that she might've just wanted to shop without help, or someone hovering over her. I totally get that. I'm the same way. But like? She never indicated she didn't want help, aside from when she jumped down my goddamn throat, and also *you're a fucking* ***adult****, have some goddamn courtesy*. ""I'll just have a look myself"" or ""Oh I don't need any help"" would have fucking *sufficed,* and I would've left.

I'm fully expecting her to show up again soon to return something. If she does, I'll flat-out tell her that I won't serve her, refuse to speak to her any further, and get one of my managers. Any of them will back me up, no matter how hard she complains. Thank fuck I have a good team.",0,1633493437
269,"""But I want *this* one.""","Greetings fellow overworked, retail friends. Today I bring you the story of a dear woman who was *determined* to get a product that I couldn't sell individually. Allow us to proceed.

So, I work at a big box store where I am the Key person. I cut keys, whether it's regular house keys, auto keys, or general keys I'm your gal. I've two machines, one that is super easy to use and one that's a little older, but still extremely trustworthy.

It's about an average Tuesday morning, somewhat gloomy in my small corner of the world and my keys desk has been somewhat busy. Everyone is out doing renovations and determined to get keys for their new doors and what-not.

Unfortunately, I'm moderately grumpy, but still that retail chipperness. In comes our stars of the show, C1 (Customer 1) and his wife C2 (customer 2). They'd like some keys. Sure! No problem! I'm the wizard of the keys.

While my machine is aligning the keys and cutting, a woman has a little tag to add onto the key for a description that she pulled from a basket in front of my desk where the homes are for the packages of about 5 tags.

""And I'd like this please."" C2 says.

A few things: 1, I don't sell the tags individually, as one can guess, and two, I can't cash out anyone at my desk. Thus, I inform her of such, and am met with a dead eyed stare.

""But I want this one.""

""I understand, but like I said unfortunately I can't sell you that one. I believe someone pulled it out of its product packaging.""

The same, dead stare.

""But I want *this* one.""

Ma'am.

""I understand that, but unfortunately I do not have a product code to sell you that one, and can only sell them in packs.""

THE LARGEST SIGH IN THE WORLD, FOLLOWED BY

""But I don't need *all* of them! I just want this one!""

Y'all, I nearly lost my mind and remember just stating at her, so confused. A happy ending, a customer behind her pulled the package that had them and told her ""I'll sell you one for a dollar."" As if sensing my complete and utter loss of emotions this customer came to my rescue (though I'm unsure if it was technically allowed) and proceeded to buy the whole thing, selling C2 her *single* tag  while going off about how I couldn't sell her one of them.

Guys, I just... yeah.",0,1633488678
270,"""I need the 3""","Vape shop 

Had a dude call earlier in the day asking if we carried T3 coils. I told him we don't have any T3 specifically, but we have a Kanger coil that is compatible. He sounded visibly confused and told me he would talk to his wife. 

About an hour later, a man comes in saying he's the one who called about the coil and immediately walks over to a section of our coil wall where the coils for a completely different device than the one he was asking about are. I ask if he's wanting the Kanger T3 ones and he goes ""no, I'm looking for the coil"". I don't know what that means but I ignore it because he seems to have known where to look in the store for whatever he was actually after. 

After a few seconds of him staring at the Voopoo coils he goes ""it's for my wife, she needs the 3"". I now want to die, because that is absolutely not sufficient information. The best he could do was show me a picture of her Drag and I point out the two coils it could possibly be, the PnP VM3 or the PnP VM1 which is a .3 ohm. I sit them down in front of him, he tells me he doesn't know and calls his wife. 

On speaker, the wife confidently announces ""I need a 3"". I fight the urge not to punch a hole through the glass display case as I swallow my frustration and calmly repeat the two options that she could possibly be looking for. ""We have the PnP VM3, or the PnP VM1 which is a .3 if that's what you mean by '3'"". She responds with ""it's the PnP 3"". There's literally no such thing as a PnP 3 and I really wanted to tell her that point blank but I decided it wasn't very professional. 

""I've honestly never heard of the PnP 3, the only two we carry that will fit your mod and have 3 somewhere in the name are the VM3 and VM1 .3 ohm"". She then proceeds to get a salty attitude, as if this dog and pony show that is unfolding is somehow my fault. She lets out a frustrated sigh and goes ""let me DIG through the trash then, I already THREW the box out"". Ok have fun. 

A minute or so later she comes back and reads the box aloud. ""IT'S THE P...PNP....PNP VM3"".

274,T-Bone Steaks are $1!!!,"So this one happened a number of years back now. I was working the cash one night at a large grocery chain here in Canada. It was a pretty slow night; only a few customers an hour type of evening. 

I was standing at my register and talking to one of my co-workers when a lady and her kid pull up to my lane and starts unloading her shopping cart that had about a dozen large packages of T-Bone steaks. I didn't think too much of it at first since sometimes people come in with big orders for BBQs. 

I finish scanning her order and give her the total (a few hundred dollars as each pack was about $20-25). She immediately goes full Karen and yells at me ""You scanned those wrong! They are $1 each!"".

I asked her if she meant the steaks and she yelled again ""Yes, of course the steaks!"". I explained to her that steaks are priced by weight and they couldn't be $1 each. She continues to freak out and yells some more about how I'm an idiot and will never amount to anything (I was in college at the time and am a fairly successful accountant now for the record haha). Her kid is standing there the whole time looking horrifying, but also likes they've seen this before. 

She then yells ""If you're calling me a liar come and see and I'll show you they are $1 each!"". As I said it's a slow night so I say sure and follow her to the cooler section. Once there she point to a sign near the streak cooler and yells ""Look! It says right there! $1 each! Or can you not read!""

I look at the sign, look back and the woman and say ""Well ma'am it does say $1 each...for the bottles of ketchup in the display the sign is clearly hanging off of.""

She looks at the sign again and realizes her mistake but yells one more time ""Well why would you put it so close to the steaks!?!?"". With that she storms off; her kid looked so embarrassed. To this day it was one of the most satisfying things that has happened on the job.",0,1633317972

How was your experiences, and so on type of questions.  


When I phoned the customer to find out why he felt this way, he told me:  
""Oh no the girl that served me was amazing she got me precisely what I wanted and then you helped me move over my contacts. But recently the tower near my home has been done and I was without signal for 6 hours.""  


Explained to the customer that I can set up a compliant for him and get a decision maker to contact him. But what he had just done was to cost a worker their entire quarter bonus pay, forcing them to survive on minimum wage.  


He asked me to change it he did not mean it against the individual but it is not my decision its the company policy all feedback is permanent and the comments go no further then to that individual and their manager.  


Have been involved with 10 customer facing companies in my life and this is not known at all. If you want to make a point just use the word compliant do not use interaction feedback forms. Make your compliant public if you want the company to listen.

284,Plausible deniability,"I work at a convenience store. In our store, we have some customers who have issues with alcohol. Because of this, we have instituted a policy of “once per shift, per customer.”  There are some people though, who are regulars. They’re our buddies. And if we think they are not impaired and not driving maybe we don’t feel like we enjoy enforcing that rule. 

Hence the “plausible deniability break.”  In other words, if Jeff* comes in and buys a mikes hard lemonade, then two hours later I see Jeff coming to the store, I may think, “I know him. He walked down here from his house 2 blocks away to buy more alcohol.” And I will take my plausible deniability break and run off to check the laundromat or something while my co-worker sells to him. 

The other night I see Jeff coming. So I tell my co-worker I saw a few six-packs that needed stocked. I go into the cooler and while I’m stocking the cooler the door opens. In walks Jeff who yells, “sure is a cold place for us to make out!”

285,Closing time chaos,"So this was a few years back.  I worked in a clothing store.  At the time we had a buy one get one 70% off sale on clearance.  Brought in lots of people.  The type of people who would drive 30 minutes home and then another 30 back to the store so we could adjust their bill and save them 50 cents.

Now, the 70% was taken off the lowest priced item.  This is common.  What it meant for us, however, was people standing at the till for 20 minutes sorting out their piles to try to get the best deals.  Buy the $30 stuff in one transaction, $40 stuff in another, $10 stuff in yet another...because who wants 70% off of $5 when it's all bought together, right?

And to be honest we didn't necessarily mind doing it. Most people were at least semi decent about it and we liked getting them the best deals.

Except for one night.  These people were in just before closing.  And...we weren't allowed to say anything to make them leave.  We also only had 30 minutes to clean, count tills, do the bank deposit, fill out all the reports, etc. and get out.  So, these people were in and out of the fitting rooms, browsing away, and finally 15 minutes after closing came up to pay.

My manager rang them up.  Put everything together on one bill to get them out faster.  And cue the meltdown.  They want to know which ones got the discounts.  Got mad when they realized they could be saving more.  Demanded we redo everything.  Manager sighs and starts undoing everything on the computer.  While that's processing and the customers are sorting piles, manager picks up the phone behind cash and calls her husband and tells him not to start dinner.  Customer gets livid and says we're incredibly rude.  Tries to storm out the door, except it's locked.

I followed them to the vestibule to unlock the door and said ""I'm sorry for what's happened but we're closed.  We have been closed for a while now and we only have a certain amount of time to get the closing tasks done before we're supposed to leave.  We're just...running out of time...""

They look from the door to me and one replies ""you might be closed but she doesn't have to be so rude!""

By then manager was also there.  She told them she would still ring up their stuff if they wanted it.  Their choice.  They came back in and got their stuff.  We let them out.  I don't think many chores got done that night.  Manager and I were both frazzled.  I ran around grabbing hanger bins and garbage and she did as quick a count as she could manage.

288,I'm an employee. Not store security.,"Yes this is a personal experience, but I feel it is also the case in a *lot* of other work places, and needs addressing.   

The (large) company I work for is too cheap to hire any kind of security despite the fact they know full well that their chain attracts a ton of theft, which purposes quite a danger to their employees. Apparently we're supposed to do our already underpaid jobs, but also take time to ""inconspicuously"" follow around anyone we think is stealing. Not supposed to confront or stop them ""for our own safety"" though.   

How does this make sense? So we follow them around wasting our own time only to do nothing in the end? Then get written up for letting it happen and not getting what we need to do done, because we were told to follow and watch them, but we're also told not to do anything because it's ""not safe""?

289,Grandma saw this one happen.,"I can't find a sub for this story, but it is about retail, just from a third party POV.

	My grandmother used to tell stories that I always took to be amusing anecdotes. I actually don’t know if any of them were true stories but I think they were. The following is one such story. The names are changed even though the story is so old that it’s likely that nobody could identify anyone in the story.

	Back in the northern town where my grandma lived when she was young there was a general store (you younger readers may think of it as a small department store with wood floors.) Such stores were usually run by the owner or the owner’s family. The owner of this store (John) was teaching his son (Issac) about running the store so the lad could take over when the time came.

	One day John told Issac that he would be taking care of the next customer but John would be watching in case he needed help. It should be noted that John had been trying to give Issac a sense of ownership by referring to everything as “your” when talking to Issac about the stock.

	The next customer was an older lady who ordered a number of items and finished up by asking about getting new dress pants for her husband. Now back then a general store would have a few samples and the actual clothing was ordered by sending the measurements of the person that the garment was for out and waiting for the clothing to be shipped back. Issac was happy to lead her over to the rack where the samples of pants hung. Issac was explaining the different kinds of pants she could order and what sorts of fabrics they came in when his father tried to whisper in a voice that was actually too loud for a whisper the advice to make it easier for the lady to see and feel the different samples which according to the story went: “Issac… Issac… Take your pants down, show the lady what you got.",0,1633034334

The cast: (M)anager played by me, (L)ead Cashier, (O)ld Lady

It's a fine Wednesday afternoon and I'm working on some frozen and refrigerated items my employees forgot to work when they came in about two hours prior when suddenly L appears. 

L: I have a customer up front who is trying to return a tube of flea medicine for her pet but she doesn't have any proof of purchase. No receipt, no box, and no loyalty account to look up the receipt. I told her I would come back and get you to see if you can do anything for her. She seems like one of those people that would ask for a manager if I just told her no.

M: I can't do anything for her but sure I'll go talk to her.

L hands M the tube of medicine.

M: Good morning ma'am. I hear we are trying to return this. *places tube on the counter* Now without the receipt, box, or account there isn't much I can do for you.

O: It's been two weeks since I bought this and my dog still has fleas aren't you going to stand by your product?

M: No I'm going to stand by the return policy. It's a no questions asked sixty days return if you have any of those three things.

O storms off towards the door making it about ten feet before turning around. M walks around the register to hand it back over to L so they can help the next guest.

O: Who keeps the box and receipt for flea medicine!?

M: If you had kept it I could have done the return no questions asked.

294,Our patience is not unlimited,"When I sold cars I had a customer come in on a Grand Cherokee Limited. We had one left over that was new, but a previous model year with a significant discount. This was the last one at that price.

Well the customer bought it, he had inspected the vehicle prior to purchase as he was a bit anal on its condition. But hey he was spending good money on the vehicle. When our lot tech went to go grab the vehicle to be detailed the lot tech took a turn too sharp and rubbed up against a concrete barrier. The passenger side door paint was all jacked up and was obviously in need of repair. The customer was informed, and we went over his options. At this point he was not the owner of the vehicle and if he wanted too he could back out. So his options were as follows

* Back out of the deal completely and walk away with his trade/deposit/etc 
* We'd let him change to a different vehicle and he'd get $1,000 extra off
* We'd repair the vehicle at our body shop, in addition we'd discount the car another $500
* We'd allow him to have another shop of his choosing repair the vehicle with a max cap of $500 in repair, in addition we'd discount the car an additional $500

Both repair options involved him keeping his trade until the repair was complete so he'd have a vehicle to drive. He opted for option C. So he took off in his trade, and we told him we'd call him in the morning after our body shop gave us a time estimate on how long it'd take to fix. He agreed and left. 

Next day we called him and told him how long it'd take to fix, and he said fine he'll come back in then to make sure its all good. A few days later the repair is completed, I inspect it, looks good. My GM inspects it, looks good to him. Repair was perfectly fine. 

He comes in and immediately complains the paint doesn't match. We explain the paint does match, our body shop is certified and this is a brand new car we work on often. We ask him to point out where the paint doesn't match, he's unable to point it out because the paint does match. Then he goes on about how we need to discount the vehicle more since its value has been diminished. We ask him what he's talking about he says when a car is in an accident you get a check for the reduced value. We point out the fact that the total repair was under $500, also the accident wasn't reported as we dealt with it in house so it'd never pop up on a carfax or anything like that.

Long story short he takes the vehicle. 

A week later he calls me and tells me he's not happy and he wants to get the vehicle fixed at another repair shop. I go to my manager, and my manager really doesn't want to say yes, so my manager tells him that he needs to pick a repair shop, and I will go with him. If the repair shop says the paint matches, its final and done. If the repair shop says the paint doesn't match we will pay the shop to make the paint match. He chooses his repair shop, which is a well known body shop in the area.

He picks me up, we go to the repair shop. Repair shop (who is independent of us by the way) looks at the vehicle and says they can't tell the door been painted, the paint matches. To which he asks the repair shop if the fact the door been in an accident would it reduce the value of the vehicle. The shop even backs us up by saying no, cause you can't tell and unless we filled an accident report or made a claim with insurance (which we didn't) it wouldn't even show up. He's frustrated at this point, because the shop won't agree the paint doesn't match (cause the paint did match)

We go back to my dealership, he's not happy. My GM makes the unusual gesture of saying ""we still have your trade, if you want to return the vehicle we will unwind the deal, you take your trade back and we part ways"" he goes ""No I just want you to make things right"" to which my GM basically says, we let you pick an independent repair shop, they agree that the paint matches, the paint matches, if your still unhappy lets just take your car back, we give you your trade back and we go our separate ways because its quickly becoming obvious you won't be happy. He doesn't want to do that and he leaves.

Two week later he calls me, by this point his car is fully registered and titled meaning if we took it back, it'd be treated as a used car. He wants us to refund $1,000 for his troubles, we tell him no. He then asks if we can unwind the deal. We'd take a massive financial loss if we did that, and we tell him no. The back and forth gets heated, and I'm exhausted so I hang up on him which was wrong of me.

He then complained, his compliant quickly escalated to the dealerships owner. I was told the owner was going meet with the customer, which was VERY RARE and it was likely I'd be suspended for 5 days.

Apparently in the meeting with the owner, things got heated, the owner made him an offer which included $500 refund + he can have the repair shop that we went too repaint the door again just to be safe. The counter apparently was $500 refund + he can have the repair shop repaint the door at our expense, and my termination for disrespecting him. That last part rubbed the owner the wrong way. 

So the final offer was the customer is blacklisted from ever doing service, warranty work, or purchasing another vehicle from us and he gets absolutely nothing in terms of compensation. My GM called me aside and told me I should feel lucky that the customer royally pissed off the owner and that I wasn't going get suspended.",0,1632988813
295,"Wrong price, wrong time of night.","So this is short.

Had a guy come in, he was buying about $5 worth of items. We have a sale on brownie mixes where they are $1. Well one rang up full price, so not an issue it’s slow, so I walk with him to the display. The one that rang up is excluded but understandably it’s with the dollar ones. So, he goes “see! They all say a dollar!” I simply said “well the ones at the bottom (the one he had) don’t have the dollar tag.” He then says “don’t f’ing argue with me.”

I’m like okay. No problem. “Sorry sir I wasn’t arguing just pointing out the sale.” Well he just says “you were arguing, just f’ing take it off.” So I come around the counter and he’s swearing the whole time. So when I get to the register I was just “look do you want me to just cancel the transaction?” He swore a bit more and declared he wanted me to just cancel it all.

I smiled, said “okay! You have a great night sir!” And then he paced back and forth for a few seconds, huffed and stormed out.

Not sure if he wanted me to argue with him or concede and just make it a dollar. Had he not been confrontational I honestly would’ve just adjusted the price to $1 since the signs were misleading. Instead he decided to throw a big boy tantrum, over what came to 35 cents…",0,1632980940

Of course, 3 minutes until close, an older man walks in. This is the person from the call. We know this because he asks to see the dehydrators. No mask, so my coworker sitting door shift (we always have someone to make sure people are wearing masks- it’s policy) offers him a mask. He grabs it and starts walking further into the store. My coworker lets him know we actually need him to put the mask on before he fully enters the store and as he is fumbling with the mask she tells him that the mask is slightly different than some others as it goes over your head not your ears. He then proceeds to put it on wrong, with it just dangling on his face. He says “are you satisfied?” My coworker replies, “no, we do need you to wear the mask properly if you are going to shop here”.

304,So When Are You Gonna Pay?,"I work at a popular retail chain and this happened two days ago. So I was ringing up these customers; a mother and two daughters, and the transaction was fairly large. With larger transactions it usually takes me between 5 to 10 minutes to ring everything up depending on how many items the customer is getting, this one took me about 5-7 minutes (it’s hard for me to keep track of time at work because I can’t have my phone on me and the clock on most of the registers don’t display the correct time).

I was looking forward to my break during this transaction as I was supposed to go earlier but the line got busy and my other coworkers got sent before me at the time I was supposed to take my break. After I finished ringing the family up, they were trying to figure out which card to use, to me it looked like they were going to use Apple Pay so I pulled up the card transaction option on the register. I believe the mother was trying to transfer money, and one of the daughters decided to try using after pay so she downloaded the app - which obviously took a moment. I waited about 5 or so minutes before the pin pad timed out because there was no response. The mother was periodically apologizing for taking a while.

The app finally downloaded, and I pulled up the pay screen again. The daughter was able to log in and she wasn’t sure if it would work, but it did and this all took about 3 minutes. After I printed their receipt and handed them their stuff, I went on break. After I clocked out and was headed downstairs I noticed they were still in the same spot I rang them up at. 

I’m not sure why it took so long for them to pay, as I would’ve assumed they’d prepare to pay while I was ringing up the items, but maybe they wanted to see how much it would be. Maybe they didn’t have the money, but at least they were able to use after pay.",0,1632852874

I worked for a supermarket, that scans items very fast and encourages customers to pack their bags at the packing bench. 

It was 1st thing in a morning so very quiet, just a few customers milling about. I had just served a lady, who was packing her items into her bags but acting very strangely. There were no other customers around so I jumped off the register to see if she was ok. 

I wasn't normally this nice, but first thing in a morning I still had a bit of humanity and dignity left. 

Me: Are you ok madam? 

Customer tries to hand me what looks like a lunch bag and asks if I would dispose of it for her. 

This is a nice lunch bag, not a disposable one, would probably have cost about £5, so I thought it was weird, and before taking it off her, I asked what was in it. 

Her answer? - A dead mouse! 

I almost screamed (I'm quite squeamish) and started stuttering. A dead mouse? OMG, did you find it in the shop? Or in the car park? Was it alive when you caught it? I was getting a bit panicky and ready to call the manager. Would we have to close the whole shop down? 

Oh no, she replies. My cat killed it this morning before I got into my car to come shopping. 

I stared at her incredulously. 

What I wanted to say - So you put a dead mouse in a bag, put it in your car, took it out of your car when you arrived at the supermarket, carried it around in your trolley while doing your shopping, then asked the store assistant to get rid of it for you? 

What I actually said- I'm sorry madam but as this shop is a food retailer, we are unable to dispose of vermin for you. It would violate many health and safety laws. Please take it home with you. 

She just shrugged, finished her packing and went home.  There's one bin on the car park, so I watched her to see if she would bin it anyway, but no, she just packed her car and went home!",0,1632820407

310,Asphalt Meltdown,"I was managing a convenience store that the company I worked for bought. It had a gravel parking lot. After a couple years (1992), they decided to pave it and took bids for the construction. It was agreed that I would get my dad to help out in order to keep cars from driving on it. When the construction crew arrived, I heard a bunch of yelling and screaming. It turns out that the owner of the crew was a real d\*\*k. All he did while he was there was scream at his employees. I even mentioned to one of the workers about how bad his boss was. It was then that I decided that I wasn't going to put my dad in that situation. He was in his 70's and he didn't need this guy screaming at him if a car slipped through. 

The boss then goes into my backroom and takes out a bunch of empty pop crates to put around the perimeter. When I saw that, I wasn't having it. Those crates have a $1.60 deposit on them. I grabbed a bunch of cardboard boxes and started filling them with dirt from a dirt pile I had next to the store. Then I went around and replaced the plastic crates and put the cardboard ones in their place. When he sees what I'm doing, he comes over and kicks the plastic ones and scatters them all over. Then he threatens to beat my a\*\*. I told him that if he does, I hope he has a good lawyer and he responded that he hoped I have a good doctor. I just picked up the crates and took them back into the store. The cardboard ones worked and no one drove on the asphalt. 

A couple days later, I get a call from one of my bosses from corporate asking why I didn't have my dad to help out that day like we agreed. I just told them that the guy was a real jerk; was always screaming at his workers and I wasn't going to subject my dad to that nonsense. I never heard any more about it.",0,1632776473
311,Construction is just an excuse - You must hit our unreasonable quotas,"Way back in the pre-covid days, I worked for a mall kiosk selling jewelry. We had daily and monthly quotas that came from head office, and the employment was a revolving door. I had three different store managers and two different district managers in under a year, and I quickly became the longest employed at the store at only 4 months. Long story short the store as a whole was a huge mess in a hundred different ways, but this instance just makes me laugh looking back on it.

For context, our store was the most profitable out of the dozen or so in the whole company. The mall is pretty big and very high traffic, but it can't escape the shift to online retail just like the rest of the world, evidenced by the fact that every shop in the mall experienced decreased sales, and many shops moving out and new ones moving in. So our sales dipped compared to last year, which made head office angry with us, the five or so 17-22 y/o's running it, like it was our fault. They kept their quotas HIGHER than anything the store had ever made previously.

Then, the store closest to the kiosk closed, and a new one was set to move in, which meant construction as they renovated the space. They were SUPPOSED to leave the noisy bits for after hours, but these guys ignored that. We talked to the mall, nothing changed. So now we have customers trying to buy something, only to be interrupted by intensely loud drilling and decided it's not worth it when they can't even hear their own thoughts. What does head office say when we warn them of the loss in revenue? 

""That's just an excuse.""

312,A bit of how’s your father in the changing room,"So this was a while back, as I’ve not worked in retail for a while and newly discovered this subreddit.

I worked in a moderately expensive clothes store at this point. Changing rooms were limited to one person, unless of course you needed the disabled changing rooms, or had a child with you etc.

I was helping a guy who didn’t speak too much English, he handed me 4 items, so I gave him the tag and off he went. His partner then almost sprinted to the changing room with him, until I let her know it was only one person allowed in each, and he could come out and show her the clothes he was trying.

Even though her English wasn’t great, it was better than his and she clearly understood so she waited outside. I usually put them in the first room, but he gestured towards the mirror at the end, and obviously wanted to be further down, which wasn’t a problem. After a couple of minutes, the guy came out and asked her to fetch him a different size in the jumper he tried. She came back to me and asked if we had it in a smaller size in the back as there wasn’t one out.

So I let my colleague who was on the till know that I was popping in the back to grab the smaller jumper, so that she could come and watch the fitting rooms as we made sure they were attended at all times.

I was in the back for a good 5 minutes. I was certain we had one of these jumpers in the smaller size, because we only had them delivered earlier that week. So I was really digging around as it was a good sale if he ended up taking it.

I went out on the shop floor again eventually and shouted to the guy that we didn’t have it. He didn’t say anything, so I went to look for his partner was no longer at the fitting rooms, I assumed she must have been looking round. After a quick walk of the floor I couldn’t find her, and I asked my colleague if she had seen her. To which she said she’d been putting a couple of sales through so didn’t have time to check on my customer. 

I went across to where the jumpers were, and noticed the size he needed was there, so gleefully I picked it up and ran to the fitting rooms, thinking his partner must’ve missed it. So I shouted him and left it hooked on the back of the door to his fitting room.

After another minute or so I went to help a different customer, and then noticed the guy come out of the fitting rooms with nothing in his hand, I was about to go over to him and ask about the clothes but he was out the door by the time I helped the other customer.

Oh well, sale gone I thought. And then as I led my new customer to the changing rooms, the other guys partner rushes out, almost full sprint, doing up a button with one hand, and wiping her mouth with the other. It then dawned on me I’d been completely swindled, and they were both in there as soon as I went into the back. It was all a clever ploy for some public nookie nookie.

The confirmation of this for me was the sweaty arse print on the matte black bench in the fitting room. And obviously the wiping of genital juice from her mouth.",0,1632757549

316,Public Health Is Never Something To Sneeze At,"Way back in January 2021, I was working at a gas station that was part of a nation-wide chain that was starting to hammer down on the COVID mandates and regulations. It's worth mentioning that this particular chain has some networking stuff set up that the store's manager and/or district manager could peak through the security cameras at any point from their home and/or cell phones. This becomes important later.

Anyhow, I was working the register one night when a co-worker approached me to let me know he'd be leaving roughly two hours ahead of schedule. I promised to let management know, and he set about shutting down the kitchen and stepped outside to smoke his vape pen. His ride pulled up, and he hopped in the driver's seat, while the other person in the truck, who also worked in the kitchen, slid over to eat his supper and take a few puffs of the same vape pen. The night passed on in its dysfunctional norm.

Flash forward three days later. I arrived to work a little earlier than usual and had just signed in to my register and began the opening count when, to my shock, my manager called in another co-worker to finish the count and dragged me into his office.

Turns out, the kitchen worker that I had seen off had been suffering from flu-like symptoms for a few days prior to him leaving early. You know, the one that had shared the vape pen with a fellow kitchen worker?

It gets better.

The other guy had similarly been working in the kitchen for a couple days with similar flu-like symptoms. As if this wasn't bad enough, the manager had only found out after the district manager had asked why there were two people sniffling and coughing in the store's kitchen with that little networking feature.

Both employees had been called up for questioning and both laughed off all concerns by saying they didn't have COVID, so there was nothing to worry about. Evidently, other fun diseases like strep throat, influenza, bronchitis, etc. hadn't even been considered by Tweedledee and Tweedledumbass.

The store would be closed for the next two days as a sanitation crew thoroughly washed, sanitized, and cleansed every single work surface and floor tile in that building whilst any food made in the days the infected workers were there was pitched. The two brain trusts were ordered to get tested for COVID and not allowed to return until they had had proof that they had gone and received a clean bill of health.

As for why I had was pulled into the office? I had been out for a week-and-a-half with a bad case of strep throat and had only been back four days before the incident that started everything. Awkward timing was just a little awkward.",0,1632691873

He almost freaked out that I had never tried a lychee before. “Have you never tried a lychee before? They’re the best you have to try one!” So I said, “oh okay I’ll buy some after my shift”. Then he insisted I peel and eat one of his lychees right there and then. It was a drippy little mess of juice as I tried my first lychee, while a queue of impatient customers waited.

Then she walks toward the clothing section, where I assumed her friend was. There were three cashiers on duty, but we're all busy with cleaning and restocking in between customers.  So on her way out she stopped to pay for gas, and I was the only one at a register.

She pays for her gas, and I see one bag now has clothes in it.  It's actually pretty common in our store for people to walk around looking for so long that they forget they're holding something, so I just asked, ""And the clothes?""

She says, ""Oh, my friend bought these, she just forgot to take them with her.""  Well, my store is open 24 hours a day, and it's now almost 2:00 am.  We do stay busy, but not super crowded and I didn't see any ""friend"" walking around.  I'm not supposed to confront shoplifters, but this was just so transparent.

There was no one else in her car.

I'm just baffled.  Like, if she had tried that when we were busy it might have worked.  She could have just not stopped and paid for her gas at the pump, and I probably wouldn't have noticed.

I usually go to this one small grocery store to get snacks and stuff. I use to go 2 times a week but over the summer holidays (which finishes this week) I have been going 4-5 times a week. 

How it works is that customers line up, and wait for the clerk to call you. I've been there quite often I think the clerks who work there probably notice me. Especially during this covid period where there aren't many foreigners in Japan and I stick out like a sore thumb.

This was quite a few years ago, so I don't really remember the particular phrasing, and I'm a little foggy on the sequence of events, but I'll do my best to paint the picture.

##Background##

I was working at the Customer Service desk at a department store. A few things that $storename is known for (this is all relevant context for the tale) are:

* Whole-transaction discounts. A lot of comparable stores issue %-off coupons that only apply to one item in the transaction, or %-off-transaction coupons that exclude numerous categories of items (typically those with slimmer margins, like electronics; more-heavily-regulated categories, like alcohol; or items that are already on sale/clearance). $storename doesn't carry much in the way of the first two exclusions, and their coupons don't exclude sale or clearance prices.
* Discount stacking. $storename's coupons don't include the ""may not be combined with other offers"" language that many others do, so based on when each offer is valid, somewhere around ⅗ of the days in the year  are days in which there are two (or occasionally even 3) discounts that can be applied together.
* $storename-Cash. Roughly once a month there's a period from 8-14 days long during which every purchase earns $storename-Cash, a $10 coupon for every $50 spent, which will be redeemable usually starting the next day after the end of the earning period and expire around 1 week later. This one can get tricky when returns are involved. When a return is done against a transaction that earned $storename-Cash, such that the remaining total from the original purchase falls below the same multiple of $50, there are different options, depending on where in the cycle you are:
 * deactivate (some of) the earned $storename-Cash. If we're still in the ""earning"" period, this is the only option.
 * Reduce the amount of your refund by the amount of $storename-Cash you ""unearned"", leaving the value of your $storename-Cash unchanged. During the ""spending"" period, if you haven't spent the $storename-Cash yet, you can choose either option. If you have already spent it, then this is the only option.
* ""Yes, we can"" policy. $storename's entry-level employees are more empowered to say ""yes"" to what customers want, without getting management involved, than in any other retail company I've worked. If it's reasonable, the employee can say yes. (They don't *have* to, and there are limits, but generally the default behavior is to give a ""yes"" as much as possible.) Another aspect, especially relevant at the service desk, is that when the customer wants something we actually *can't* do, we're trained to not present this in the terms of ""no, I can't do that"", but rather in terms of ""here's what I *can* do"".

At the service desk, we paid extra attention to the discounts that had been used on the customer's original purchase, and would do our best to preserve these discounts when possible. If someone wanted to return something that they had bought at a better discount than they'd be able to get today, we might direct them to do an even exchange in order to preserve the price they had paid. Sometimes we'd manually reapply some coupon and/or sale price on a replacement purchase made following a return, to give them the same deal that they'd have gotten if they'd bought the new item back on the date of their original purchase (we could look up past sale prices on any item, by date, for a few weeks after each sale ended).

##The Story##

On this particular day, there's continually a short line at the service desk, so any interaction that involves a customer leaving the counter and coming back means they will probably have to stand in line again for a few more minutes when they return. A lady brings up a bedding set that she had purchased, but which she now wants to exchange for a different one.

Me: No problem, I can definitely help you with that. Do you have your receipt?

Lady: Yes, I have it right here.

Me: Ok, so you have two options. You can do an even exchange at any register, but only if both items are exactly the same price. This is the simplest transaction, and it will preserve all of the discounts you got on your original purchase as well as the $storename-Cash you earned that day. But I know that in the bedding department, there aren't typically very many things with the exact same price point, so more than likely you'll need to come back here to do it as a refund/purchase. I'm happy to take care of both parts of that transaction here, if you don't find an item that qualifies for an even exchange. In order to leave both options available to you, I won't do anything with your return item just yet. Go ahead and find the new item you want to get, and then, if you do find a same-price item you can go to any checkout, otherwise can come back here and I'll take care of you.

Lady heads out to the bedding department with her original set.

A while later, she comes back up with a different bedding set. Hands me the receipt for the original purchase, but she doesn't have that first set with her anymore.

Me: Ok, and the item you're returning?

Lady: It's on the receipt, right there. (She points.)

Me: Ma'am, I still need the original item in order to process this as an exchange.

Lady: You mean I have to go back out there and haul that thing back up here again? But it's so *heavy!!* Have one of your *associates* bring it up.

Me: Well, you would still have to go back there too, since you know where you actually put it.

Lady: I put it on the shelf, where it goes. But the numbers are right there on the receipt.

Me: Yes, but I would still have to actually take the item you're returning from you, in order to apply its refund value towards the other item you've selected.

Woman (no longer acting like a Lady, so I have to change her name at this point): But I already put it *back!* Why can't you just use the numbers off off the *receipt?*

Me: (breaking it down for her) Because, if I did that, without actually taking the item back, what's to stop someone from just *saying* they put an item back, in order to get a refund for something they didn't actually return?

Woman: This is RIDICULOUS! I didn't come here to be accused of STEALING! (There was probably more she said here, but I can't remember any of the rest of it. Insert the typical ranting of your choice.)

She then proceeds to throw the bedding set across the counter at me and storms off.

I go ahead and let our AP officer know about the situation. I never did find out whether she was trying to pull a fast one on us, or if she genuinely did think that just putting her return item directly back on the shelf was actually the way it was supposed to be done.",0,1632332609
336,"""Sir, that's not a warranty issue""","I used to sell cars, I had a customer that was difficult to deal with. Well I sold him a car. A year later he comes into my office mad asking for help. Says my service department is trying to rip him off because they won't fix his car under warranty. I ask him what the issue is, he tells me to go talk to my service department.

I go talk to my service department ""So-so says you aren't fixing his car under warranty"" and my service manager shakes his head and says ""His rear window is busted, busted windows are not covered by warranty"" I go ""Alright""

Go back to the customer ""What happened to your window?"" and without skipping a beat he said ""My wife caught me cheating on her, and threw a brick through my window""

Thoughts I had

* yea that's not a warranty issue
* thank you for being so honest

""Sir, that's not a warranty issue...if you want us to replace your window your going need to pay for it"" he goes ""Are you sure?"" and I'm like ""Yes...I'm very sure""

342,Those wonderful moments where you tell a customer something and they immediately ignore it.,"So this happened twice yesterday within an hour. The manager who does the ordering at my store was out sick for a week and for some reason the other managers didn’t pick up the slack and do the ordering in his place. So our store right now is very bare. We are out of so many things. Our cooler is so empty right now you could skateboard through it and not bump into any of our boxes. Specifically for this story we’re out of a lot of our single cans of beers. 

Now single cans (the 24 oz ones) are kept in a cooler behind the register. This is because there was a really big problem of people taking cans and walking out without paying, so now if you want say a 24oz or Mikes we have to get it for you like with cigarettes. We were out of our tall cans of Bud Light, Budweiser, and Natty Daddy. 

This one guy who buys like half a case of Nattys every day came in and said he wanted six nattys and I had to tel him we are our was there something he wanted instead. “I said I wanted six natty daddy’s” and then a few seconds later it was just that “oh, your out.” Like I just said we’re out? He grumbled and said he needed a minute to figure out what he wanted, and I tried to be helpful and said everything he saw in the case right now we had a full shelf of *except* the natural ice, we just have one can of Ice left. He immediately responded that he wanted natural ice so I get him our last can. “I wanted three.” I just kind of stared at him trying my best not to let the irritation show *”As I said we only had the one can left”* He claims he didn’t hear me, I wanted to respond that no he wasn’t listening but didn’t because some things you don’t say out loud.  (And before you say hearing problems. I know the guy, he isn’t HoH, and I don’t mumble when I’m working. He’s just one of those people who actively choose to not listen to what employees are saying) 

The other one I don’t know what was going on with him, he was on his phone basically screaming into it as he talked and maybe that’s why he ignored what I said. Wanted a whole case (12 cans) worth of our tall cans. Six High Gravity’s and then asked for six Budweiser’s. I had to explain we are out of Budweiser’s and he then said six Bud Heavys (which I learned later was apparently another name for Budweiser) I assumed he meant Bud lite which didn’t change anything because we had sold out of that on Sunday. This went on for *four times.* Him saying Bud and me explaining we are out and offering different drinks. Coors. Miller’s. Bud lite lime. Busch lite. Steele reserve. Etc. did my best to keep a customer service smile and tone. nope. Nothing worked. He pulled away and asked how hard it was to understand he wanted a Bud heavy and i think he finally realized when I said one last time that we didn’t have any that we  really don’t have any single cans. So he shuffled away and came back with one of those six packs of 16 oz grumbling about how I wasted his time. 

Some people just don’t have listening skills do they? I’m sure some of y’all know what it’s like dealing with this.",0,1632252563

346,Do you not understand why it's there?,"At my store we have these hanging plastic shields because... you know. We also still have mask restrictions in my state but my boss told us to ignore it because of several violent interactions involving asking people to wear masks and one negative review that complained about it. I'm looking for another job and a way out, but for the moment I need this job to survive (otherwise I would have been long gone by now).

Today this very old man came in because (as always) the pumps weren't taking his card. I don't know why our pump card readers are so broken, but they just constantly are. I do know that they never get any maintenance and they never get reset because of the absolute laziness of my fellow employees, but as a cashier I don't know what I could possibly do about it. I've complained to my boss so many times but after 3 years it has changed nothing.

So this man complains the pump wouldn't take his card. I tell him I can ring him up inside instead and ask him how much he needs. He looks at me with that look on his face when a customer didn't understand (either didn't bother too or just couldn't) and asked me to repeat myself. So I did, a bit louder. Then he still couldn't hear me so I repeated myself louder again. He still couldn't hear so I just yelled it at him, since I had no way of getting louder without doing so.

He still didn't hear me, and his solution to this was to duck down and stick his head under the plastic shield and ask me again what I was saying. I backed up as far as I could and repeated myself *yet again* as loudly as I could and he finally understood. He told me how much he wanted, *then kept his head under the plastic at this uncomfortable angle just staring at me*. Mind you he had no mask, and I had been told by my employer not to enforce the mask mandate (no matter how much I wanted to).

I literally had to yell at this man for the rest of the transaction for him to hear me. Once I realized he was basically deaf I felt a little bad, but he could have stepped one foot to the side to avoid the plastic instead of stooping down and sticking his head under it. Am I crazy? He's not the first one to do it, but he was the first one to visibly leave spittle and sweat on the counter because he basically rubbed his face on it. I feel insane, because it was just so gross and just so... strange...

So since there is a national coin shortage, the self-checkouts don't do cash transactions( for a couple months now).

Well then he just spun in a circle with his arms gesturing to no one like a baby( since he and I were the only in the area). I noticed him doing that and said he has to go to a lane if his card isn't working. I then cancel his purchase and turn around to go back to my little desk. I then see him follow me and then do his gesture dance like I am going to leave this area unattended to open a new land and check him out.

354,Corona Karen,"No one was anywhere near my till. I turned of my light and was 2 tills away, about to count my managers coins from home, when Corona Karen comes to my till. I head back, and thankfully, I know how to keep her from Karening it up too bad. She still takes to much time for one person, but oh well.

Every time before she would clean my till for me. Not this time. She makes me clean the whole till (I mean yeah I should do it from time to time, but even if I had just done it, she would have had me do it). 

Then she goes on and on about: When do I think this will be all over, will it ever etc (same conversation every time. I answer the same, we need more of us to be vaccinated and probably similar to the flu at some point. I'm no expert lady, why do you think I'd know). 

Also every time before she'd bag. Not this time. She is walking so I need to double bag. Oh and while I'm bagging did that bacon ring up at 24 no I mean 18? Well, it wasn't bacon and it was $16.24, but I showed it to her and at least she's good with that. While I'm bagging, she ends up having EBT. It finally dawns on her to ask me why she can't pay. I tell her sorry I was focusing on double bagging and didn't see how she was paying, one moment while I get it ready. 

Then, she knows she had one item that was not food. It was $1.3. She first says let me see if I have any change. Asking me again how much the change was. She doesn't. She gets out her card, and asks how she wanted to run it as credit. I'm sorry ma'am but Visa Debit is the only option you have. (I honestly do not know if this is both debit and credit or what cause they first select debit or credit and this is the 2nd option (not US debit.). 

I then move on to the next customer (light still off). Near the end, cashier needs me for a pull. I go over and express my frustration to my cashier and quickly rest my head on his upper back (not professional, but nothing meant by it, save for ""ugh have empathy for me"").

My manager who wanted her $6 of coins turned into cash, aka why my light was off in the first place comes back annoyed (she wanted to buy some groceries at that time, with said money). I told her I had just finished with that lady (my manager was the one who told me the lady was in my line). As I was then doing a pull of a cashier my manager hops on my lane b/c some other idiot took that just cause someone was being served that meant my lane was open. I had already rang up most of his items, but he kept bring them to his cart unbagged. so, when my manager came in midstream I had to figure out quickly what still needed scanning (the case of soda in his cart esp). 

At least this guy was kind enough as he told me in Broken English I deserve double the raise cause everyone needs me. I laugh back at him, if only.",0,1632119348

360,"If you MUST write a check, at least have your ID on hand!","I'm a cashier at a large retail store. We sell all kinds of things. We also have a decent number of electric carts for those who can't get around. Well, I got to deal with one such individual who had filled the cart with a number of heavy items. No problem. I offered carryout and helped unload and reload the cart. Then it came time to pay. And out came the checkbook. Now normally this isn't too big of a deal, but every so often, the system would require you to do an ID check. It wasn't simply age-related or anything, just that it hadn't been seen by the system in a while. This was information that had to be directly typed into the system, not simple information like date of birth. And of course, the elderly shopper who has her wallet and her bag, does not have her id. So, what are we to do? She was not exactly happy, when I told her that I would have to unload her cart and she could then exit the building and return with her id. After all I wasn't about to let her exit the building with all of her unpaid items and her transaction unfinished. Now this made her unhappy but it was also an inconvenience for me, as my lane had to shut down. The check was still in the machine the system was waiting for data and I was waiting for a very slow electric cart to make its way out and back in the building. I basically gave it a 10 minute time limit. I would simply have had to suspend her transaction, leave the unscanned check with all of her items, and dealt with it at another time when and if she came back. Thanks God this was before the evening beer Rush, and we had enough staff to handle the customers. It's not that hard people! If you have a form of currency that may require an ID check, keep your ID with you! You really should anyway as it is very important and expensive item. Did I mention I hate checks?",0,1632084955

364,"Is The Phone Broken? No, It's Just Cracked. Well, That's Broken.","My last story about a customer visiting my workplace went well so I thought I would share another. The background in this case is that during the launch of the Samsung S10 they had a promotional deal where if you got that device on a repayment plan with various service providers you would get a free upgrade to the 5G model when it was released a few months later. It was as easy as clicking a button on our end and it was legitimately at no extra cost. The only qualifier was that the phone had to be undamaged as you would hand back the old one in store (or send via the post if you did it online) and we would then hand you the latest 5G model.

So we are about halfway through the promo period of this upgrade phase during this incident. It has been smooth sailing so far with no major hiccups with people swapping devices out. Anyway, I get called over by a staff member and told that my next customer is wanting to take up the swap promo. I'm thinking easy as! This will be a nice quick one and then I can go to lunch. I organise said agreement with my staff member who was running the floor that day.

Customer comes in and I realise it's a long standing customer that we know very well. Loves to argue the point so on and so forth. We sit down and begin discussing what they are in for, and I quickly get to the point of how the swap works and that nothing changes with the plan they are on except they get a brand new device. Customer is happy. I'm ready to go. I ask to see the phone when the following exchange happens.

Me: Uh, what happened to the back of the phone? It's cracked.

Customer: I dropped it. Still works though.

Me: I can see that but the terms and conditions say that it has to be not broken.

Customer: It's not broken.

Me: Pardon?

Customer: It's not broken. The phone is cracked. Not broken.

Me: Nah, that's broken mate. Will cost you $190 to swap it as damaged.

Customer: No! They said it would be free if I swapped the phone.

Me: Yes, free if it wasn't broken.

Customer: It's not broken.

When I say this debate went on for 10 minutes I tell no lies. The debate around if a cracked phone meant that it was broken was a heavy one. I attempted to position it as if I handed them the phone out of the box in the condition it was presented to me in would they accept it. That point was dismissed as cracked did not equal damaged. Needless to say they did not go through with the swap and all these years later I have never seen that customer again. They were always in our shop at the time so I assume this incident turned them off our crew.",0,1632040766

367,"Stupidest workplace injury ever, or 'Yet Another Reason why Mandatory Name Badges are a Bad Idea'","WARNING: this story involves titties and stabbing. Do not read if you, like me, are against both or either of these things.

So today I was in the fitting room at the department store I work at, clearing up after a customer I had just finished helping. I was hanging up a pair of trousers using one of those hangers with the spring-loaded clips, and a piece of metal pinged off of it, smacked into my name badge and somehow caused the pin to come undone. I didn't realise anything was wrong right away, because the badge didn't fall off (for reasons that will become clear very soon) so I just went on with my work. Then my service leader came over to tell me that my previous customer had given some really glowing feedback about me, which was nice, but I couldn't enjoy it because it was at this moment that I became aware of a dull pain DEEP inside my boob and realised what had happened.

I excused myself by mumbling something along the lines of 'I've stabbed myself in the boob' and got myself into a stall in the staff bathroom to clean up. The pin is decently girthy and about 1.5 inches long, and the WHOLE thing was buried in my titty right above my areola, and it didn't want to come out AT ALL. I didn't want to call a first aider because, well, it's my titty, so I had to grit my teeth and yank it out, massively misjudging the direction of the stab and so tearing my skin a fair amount. Then I took off my top and binder (I have NO idea how the pointy little fucker got through my binder in the first place, but here we are) to inspect the damage. My top was a bodysuit, so I had to take my trousers down a bit too- this isn't really relevant but it kind of adds to the ridiculousness of the whole scene. There was barely any blood but I'm really squeamish about needles, and of course it was at about this point, when I was basically naked, that I began feeling faint and nauseous.

One of my managers happened to be using the stall next to me at the exact moment that I started to make god-awful retching sounds (really sounded 10x worse than it actually was) and she ended up calling the first aider, who was ANOTHER one of my managers, and I ended up having to explain the whole stupid situation to her through the stall door while mostly nude, all the while petrified that she'd feel justified in kicking down the door to rescue me. I then had to describe the events to her over again once I'd cleaned myself up so she could write it on an incident report. The injury site was listed as 'breast/nipple area.' Cool. Great. Amazing.

For the whole rest of the day, I had that horrid throbby needle pain in my boob, but that's probably just because I was wearing a binder and its compressing powers had NO MERCY for my tender titty. I ended up getting another really positive customer review later that day and my service leader took me to my line manager (yes, a third manager- I work at a giant department store) to make sure my perseverance in the face of titty trauma was properly recognised. My workplace is actually really supportive and cool. I wish they didn't make me wear this stupid name badge though. It now has a little nick in it where the metal ricocheted off it, and I just know that every time I look at it I'll be reminded of the stupidest workplace injury I ever sustained. There's probably some \*deep symbolism\* in here surrounding the two things I hate most about myself- my name and my titties- conspiring to injure me, but my dumb nonbinary ass cannot be bothered. I'm also pretty new to this job and I'm now concerned that I will become known as the idiot who got stabbed in the boob and kept working.",0,1632000857

I work in the returns department of a home furnishing store, and this older man comes up and has a bunch of things he wants to return. I notice one of the items is clearance so I tell him unfortunately I can’t return that as all sales are final on clearance items.
The item is a small suction cup hook and the customer claims it doesn’t stick to the glass. When I tell him I can’t return it he gets angrier and angrier and says I **have** to return it because it doesn’t work. 

I end up calling the manager and he yells at them and something wonderful happens. A nearby customer (around in his late 20’s early 30’s) starts berating the customer for yelling at us and telling him to shut up and leave us alone. He and the guy quarrel for a bit and I accidentally let out a stifled laugh at how amazing but hilarious this is, luckily nobody notices

Eventually after he’s tired himself out from his whole ‘I’ve spent thousands of dollars here and driven 20 miles from so and so’ he’s like ‘fine take it I don’t want it’ and I process the return for his other items.

Dude still berated the manager as he left lol",0,1631931078
375,"The ""Environmentally Conservative"" No-Use Plastic Initiative","Very short one here, this actually happened today. So I work for large North American electronics store. A month or so ago word went out that to be more environmentally conservative, we would be switching from a free single-use plastic bag model, to paper bags that cost $0.30, the cost being due to to both the higher price of the bags, and apparently as a deterrent to keep customers from purchasing them needlessly. When asked what we would do with all the plastic bags already in store, their only comment was that no more would be coming in.

Today, our first shipment of paper bags came in. Our store still has a noticeably large stockpile of plastic bags, so I ask my department head again, ""What are we doing with these?"" to which she replies that we will most likely either use them up and transition to paper slowly, or have them sent away for recycling.

Less than 10 minutes later(also less than 10 minutes ago) she checked the employee news app, and discovered that corporates *brilliant* policy on our plastic bags is to, quote, ""Cut them all in half and throw them in the dumpster"".

So the company that I work for has decided that their ""environmentally conservative"" solution to single-use plastic is to take all the plastic we have, convert it into no-use plastic so no one, not the employees, not the customers, not even the homeless people who just need something to temporarily carry their stuff with, can use them, and throw them into a landfill.

Needless to say, my entire department, and hopefully many others across the company's reach, are refusing to do this, and have decided to take what we need for ourselves, and find a way to recycle the rest.

382,Smartest Theft Plan That Almost Worked,"When I was 17, I had a part-time job as a cashier for Rona. During my time there I met some very interesting people at the till. Once, a man walked in wearing what looked like a Halloween construction worker costume and headed for what looked like the power tools section. Although, I later found out he went to the cleaning aisle first where we sell commercial yellow mops and buckets. He opened one box and put the mop and bucket on the sales floor to make it look like it belonged to the store. Then he used the empty box and filled it with expensive power tool kits and batteries. He had the box in a shopping cart and went up to my till. This was an elaborate plan up till now, unfortunately, he placed the box the wrong way in the cart where I couldn’t just use my scanner to get to the barcode. He tried to turn the box but since he put all these heavy tools and batteries in it, he couldn’t do it. So, he's just struggling now and then looks at me and says he forgot his wallet in his truck and quickly walked out.",0,1631848816
383,Did smokes go up? Yes.,"Little Karen story here.

I was working in the back cooking up food for our sham, when my co-worker came in and asked me to take some lady at the till.

*Kisa = me*

*Karen = lady*

*Co = coworker*

Co: Kisa, I need you to go take the till.

Kisa: Why? The food is ready in like 2 minutes.

Co: Yeah, but she really wanted to speak to someone else.

Kisa: About what?

Co: She didn't like the price of her smokes.

Kisa: Oh? Well that's Imperial Tobacco, remember what I said about them? You don't f_ck with Imperial Tobacco. Did you tell her we don't set the prices?

Co: Yeah, she still wanted to talk to someone else.

Kisa: Alright, watch the fryer, I'll go see what the problem is.

*Now, I am not a manager. I am taking a business course to eventually be able to manage my managers if I'm ever offered the role. So, I'm the closest thing to a manager when we don't have one on site, but I'm not required to do anything managing. Most of my younger co-workers however seek me out for these issues because I actually know how to handle them most of the time better than an actual manager can.*

*I walk up to the till, still wearing an apron as I thought it was just a miscommunication. We get a lot of people who are foreign or have different accents/speak a different language such as French or Spanish (both languages I kinda understand). However Karen was full capable of speaking English and didn't seem the type to enjoy our other clients if they spoke anything different.*

Kisa: Hello mam, how can I help you?

Karen: Yeah your buddy over there is trying to rip me off.

Kisa: How so?

Karen: Look at the f_cking till, that's not right.

Kiss: Mam, that's the correct price for that brand.

Karen: Did smokes go up?

Kisa: Yes.

Karen: Really? Overnight? You f_cking serious?

Kisa: Yes, the prices were updated after labor day. Imperial Tobacco sets the prices. We just do what the till tells us, mam.

Karen: Bullsh_t, take that off and redo it. You're lying.

Kisa: Okay.

*I canceled the order, rescanned her things and put on the correct promotional discounts. The same price showed up.*

Kisa: Will that be everything, for you mam?

Karen: Really, f_cking, really? Unbelievable.

*She throws the money at me and snatches the smokes.*

Karen: I want the f_cking receipt. I'll be talking to your manager. F_cking c_nt can't even do her f_cking job right.

Kisa: Have a good night.

385,Two for Five Confusion,"First post here.

Been working at a grocery store for a bit as kind of an all around customer service person since we are short staffed and I got the absolute pleasure of working self checkout a few days ago for most of the day. It's incredibly boring but whatever, we all have to do it at some point.

Toward the end of my nearly 8 hour shift, I have this old lady come up with a handful of items to one of the self checkout stations, and soon after I get waved over. I ask what the problem is, and she says a particular item is on sale for 2 for 5 dollars. This particular sale only works, obviously, if you get two of the same item, otherwise its regular price if you buy one of the item. 

Anyway I look over to the checkout screen and see she only got one of the item (tea bags or whatever I forgot) and therefor it isn't counted as the sale. I try to explain the above to her, but before I finish, she throws the tea bags off to the side. I was going to change the price to be nice to her (I don't know why I have so much discretion on this), but after that I decided that I wasn't. She says two for five means that the one item should be 2.50 by itself, not the regular price (\~15 cent more). I try to explain the deal to her again.

However she gets mad about how I don't know what I'm talking about and acts like she somehow knows the store inside and out and how everything works, telling me at one point ""son, ma'am, whatever you are, this isn't how grocery stores work!"" (I am a trans woman but come off pretty androgynous at times, especially in the work uniform). 

She ends up paying for her other items and storms out. Didn't even ask for a supervisor, which surprised me. I don't understand why some people choose to be so difficult...",0,1631834012
386,Stopped my first Code 10 (Theft) today.,"Is this what it's like to be a man now? Haha, I'm kidding. 

I work in a homewares shop in the UK; we sell bedding, furniture, curtains, towels, etc. This is my second job and I like it, I've been with the company now for about just under four years, I've seen my fair share of thefts but I've never actually had a hand in dealing with one.

Our store closes at 9 so usually around 5 onward we're running on a skeleton crew of about I would say 6 colleagues max which to me I always thought was stupid as we're not a small store, I'm going from the back of the store to the front when I spot three young kids aged I would say about aged 10 coming out of the bedding department with a trolly full of bedding, and I'm the only staff member on the shop floor that side of the store. 

I'm on the headset first thing to notify staff as our manager was not in the building at the time, they're looking around till they notice I'm looking directly at them, that's when they make a break for it and run out the entrance trolly in hand. I'm already running after them and they didn't get about three feet out the store before I got the trolly off them and they're running off empty-handed.

By the time one of my colleagues came down they were gone, I'm shaking like crazy because of the adrenaline but honestly, I came out of it feeling proud of myself even though it was just three kids. 

We put the trolly to one side and after we closed I put it all back; in total it was 21 duvet covers, 2 mattress protectors, 2 throw blankets, and 2 nightgowns. I didn't get a price on how much all of it together would have been stolen, but as some of the duvet covers were like super king size for £40 each so I imagine it was somewhere around £200-£300.

I feel like this is a weird post to make so please forgive me.",0,1631829648

388,Guy gives me his phone to tell his girlfriend we did not sell an item,"While I was in college I worked for &lt;British supermarket&gt;. I worked in general merchandise (GM) which sold toys, homeware, electronics etc. Luckily for me I didn’t experience too many awful customers but this is probably the most bizarre story I have.

I was minding my own business dressing the shelves (basically just making them tidy, it was a Friday evening and the person with the finishing shift always has to do this to make it neat for the morning) when I hear this guy talking on his phone about us not have the game Uno. He approaches me and asks me to tell his girlfriend that we do not sell Uno. 

Friends, we did sell Uno, and I had seen we had it in stock not five minutes before. I just kind of stand there confused while he tries to give me his phone while repeating “Just tell her we don’t have it” and I eventually end up taking it as what else do I do in this situation? I tell her that we do not sell Uno and this poor woman is confused because she said she saw it the other day. I felt so bad lying to her but I didn’t want an angry customer in front of me, especially while the store was so empty.

This guy did not have any items to buy. Did he go there for the sole purpose to get someone to tell his girlfriend we did not sell Uno? What did he have against buying Uno? 

I have so many questions.

TLDR; Guy gives me his phone to tell his girlfriend we did not sell Uno, when we did and had it in stock.",0,1631802877
389,Battle arena for real,"This is my first post so bare with me. 
Back in 2004, when I was in my early 20s I'm 5'8"" at the time 100 pounds soaking wet, I worked for Toys'R'Us (I know).
Now I was one of the people at the door that would check people's bags.
 Long story short Bayblade battle arena were the ""must have"" toy of that Christmas.

These were like gold dust, hen's teeth, unicorn teeth you get it.
Our store was the ONLY store in the city to get a delivery of these stupid spinning top things.

A large man (6' plus) called the store to ask if we'd gotten them in and was told yes however it was 1 per customer and first come first served.
Within 20 minutes this guy was in the store demanding to buy the entire stock all 10.

When I said no he got mad started calling me all sorts. When I asked him to the store he picked me up and threw me into a Harry Potter display.

Turns out he was a scalper and was planning to sell these on eBay for £100 each, they cost £40.
When the manager heard what had happened I got in trouble and told to clean the mess.
He refused to let me clean myself in the toi6, I had cut my hand in the struggle.

So I left the job the next day.

All she has was a case of White Claw or one of the hundreds of hard seltzers that are everywhere. So, I end up asking for her ID,



Her: It's for Instacart, you don't need it.



Me: You're still buying the alcohol, so I'll need to see your ID. 



Her: I'm only 19, but it's for an order {flashing me her phone, all I see is that the app is open.}



Me: Well, unfortunately I legally can't sell to you. 



Her: Can I talk to someone? I don't want to cancel this order. 



Me: You're welcome to talk to a manager, but they'll tell you the same thing. You shouldn't accept orders if *you* can't buy them for yourself. 




At this point, she got kinda huffy and waited around for a couple minutes, but ended up leaving without talking to anyone or getting the alcohol.

400,How dare you put that back!,"I work as a cashier at a grocery store chain. We have the usual setup for everything in usual grocery stores, fresh bakery, fresh produce, cleaning supplies, and so on. This store also utilizes a system of having one of us as a cashier and a separate employee who helps bag groceries with the cashier on bigger orders who help put items back when needed.

This event happened earlier this summer when I had been with the store for about two to three weeks and had a run in with a customer who I hope to not see again anytime soon.

I had been working my register for the better part of three hours when I had a lady come (who I’ll call C (costumer) for short) up to my register. At this time, we were not requiring people to wear masks in store, but some people did choose to do so. This lady was wearing a mask, which I am perfectly fine with. It sometimes made it hard to hear what people were saying, but usually if I asked a second time they could clarify what they had said and I’d understand.

This lady put everything she had in her cart on the conveyor belt and I began to scan the items to pass off to the other employee next to me for them to help me sort them in bags. 

While I began scanning, the lady said something that I heard as 

C: “Could you put this bleach back, I do not want it.”

To which I replied, 

“You don’t want this bleach ma’am?” 

C: “Yes, I don’t want it.”

I nodded as I put the bleach aside to hand off to an employee to be put back once I was done checking her out. 

The rest of the checkout process went fine, I got her total for the groceries she purchased, and when I asked her if she would like her receipt, she declined and said she didn’t need it. She left the store soon after, but five minute later she came storming back in and back to me behind my register.

C: “Why the HELL is my bleach not with my groceries?!”

Me, taken aback, looked at her with confusion,

“I’m sorry?”

C: “My bleach! You didn’t give me the damn bleach! Why did charge me for it?!”

At this point, I now understood what she had said earlier was to NOT put the bleach back, but was that she wanted it to be separated from the groceries (again, I had asked to clarify and she did say yes to my response). It didn’t help that she didn’t have a receipt to confirm I hadn’t actually charged her for it, but whatever.

Me: “Ma’am, I’m sorry, I thought you said you didn’t want it.”

C: “That’s no excuse! You heard me fine! I almost got run over by one of YOUR employees when I came back in!” 

At this point, my manager had caught wind from her office and had come out to talk to her, but by this time the lady had began storming off, yelling at me

C: “Fuck you! I’m never coming back here again!” And vanished into the store, supposedly to get her bleach. 

My manager, who was just as confused as I was, came over to ask me what happened, in which I told her that I thought she had said she wanted the bleach to be put back and that she didn’t want it. My manger simply nodded and gave a sig, telling me: 

“Don’t worry about her, just continue checking people out as normal. If she comes back, I’ll handle her.”

Safe to say I didn’t see her after that, as I assume she went out through self checkout. No other bad experiences and at my three month mark, my manager gave me props for handling the situation well, but said if something like that happened again that she could take care of it and to call her over. 

On the bright side, this is my only poor experience with having worked there so far. All I can hope is that the lady got her bleach, safe and sound.",0,1631649124

403,How dare you stand near me!!!,"I work as a self-checkout clerk. It's my job to stand near the registers and make sure people don't steal stuff, and make sure any issues they have with our POS system get smoothed over.

Because of the plague, I also sanitize these registers. Late last night, I was doing just that when two women came up to the register I was trying to clean. I moved off a bit until I noticed that the receipt wasn't printing after she put in her money and went over to investigate. It said she still had a dollar and fourteen cents left to pay. She asked me why it wasn't printing and I told her that, before moving away.

I stayed nearby because I still needed to clean the register.

""Are you staying here to make sure I don't steal a dollar and 14 cents?""

""No, I just wanted to sanitize the register because sometimes people are gross. Since it's what I have to do next, I just want to stick around.""

""You know we come through self checkout to avoid people.""

I internally rolled my eyes, she paid, and she left without her friend. Her friend had grabbed some food from the deli, and decided she didn't want it. So I handed it off to another associate to return, and went back to monitoring the area. A woman needed help scanning produce because it can be a pain in the ass on our system, stuff like that. I go back to the register I saw her at to get back my cleaner and paper towels, and notice that there are still two items on the belt that haven't been scanned.

""Oh, are you going to pay for those in a separate transaction, or do you not want them?""

""Well I was going to pay for them in a separate transaction, but since you've been harassing me all night, I don't want them anymore!""

""Ma'am, I'm sorry. That wasn't my intention, I was just trying to clean-""

""You've been acting like I was planning on stealing these! I'm going to call and make sure your manager hears about this tomorrow."" She picked up the two things that were still on the belt, and threw them at me. Not very hard, and they were light, but it surprised me.

""Ma'am, I'm so sorry, if you want to talk with-""

""Now you're trying to embarrass me in front of everyone to keep me from telling him what you did.""

Here we go:

Me: Hello, this is PK with *my work* how can I help you today??

CX: Hello, I called a bit ago with another CSR and they had stated that you all don’t have a tracking number for my appliance? We accidentally got disconnected but I just wanted to call back to see what’s going on. 

Me: Okay sir, let me just pull up your info! (I then proceeded to pull up his info and see that we did previously work on his unit but he got a replacement from the major retailer. He thinks we have the tracking number.) Sir, I do see that we did previously worked on your appliance and that you ordered a new one?

CX: That’s correct. 

Me: Sir, you’ll have to call *major retailer* for your tracking info. 

CX: That’s not right!

(Oh no.)

CX: You guys told ME that you had that info for me. Look, it has been over *such and such time that was normal for repairs* and I’m tired of waiting. I understand that you’re just the middle man but I really don’t want to have to sue and get my lawyer involved.

(WOW. Seriously, you’re going to sue *my work* for something that WE DIDNT DO NOR PROVIDE?!)

Me: *looking at notes seeing that the previous rep stated that he talked to someone at *major retailer* and not us for tracking info.* 

CX: Is there any manager I can talk to about this because I’m tired of being pulled through such a dumb loop. 

Me: Yes, I can see if AM is available. 

CX: Okay, thank you, I’ll hold. 

(I proceeded to place him on hold and go to talk to AM as I’m already tired of this CX, especially after saying he’s sue over us over something we don’t control.)

Me: Hey AM, do you have a second?

AM: Yeah man, what’s up? *notices the look on my face* Oh no…we have another one?

Me: Yep. This time, they’re wanting to sue us. 

AM: Wow. Alright, give me the number and I’ll call him back.

425,Please bring your ID,"...and make sure it isn't expired! 
[ a collection of small ID-related stories from my job! ]

I cannot even begin to recount the number of times someone has come up and asked for cigarettes/cigars/etc. and becomes upset when I ask for ID. We have a sign on the front door that says ""WE ID"" in bold letters, but I know reading can be hard for customers!

Here are five situations I've been in:
A very old woman can't buy cigarettes because she doesn't have her ID on her. She hits me with a curveball: talking about her family.
""Why do I have to show my ID, can't you tell I'm old enough, I have 4 grandkids and they--- blah blah blah.""
""Ma'am that doesn't matter, I can't sell to you without ID.""
She complains throughout the whole (cigarette-less) transaction about how ridiculous this is (I agree) and how ""obvious"" it is that she's old enough. Doesn't matter if it's obvious, I CAN'T SELL.

Many people like to hit me with the classic ""I need to have my ID?"" To which they get all huffy and stomp off, leaving me to put away their cart full of things they suddenly don't want because they can't buy their precious cigarettes.

""What do you mean I need my ID? I know the manager and they would let me just buy them."" or ""[This other employee] never ID's me!""
""Ma'am I am not that employee, do you have a valid ID or not.""
The woman throws her ID at me, I get her her fucking cigarettes and tell her to have a good night and she gives me the sassiest ""Mhm yeah whatever."" I've ever heard.

""I'll just go see if someone else can lend me their ID."" 
""Ma'am I still wouldn't be able to sell them to you because I know it's not your ID. You just admitted to me you're getting someone else's.""
""Well why does it matter it's obvious I'm old enough! This is ridiculous!""
This exact situation has happened SO many times I can't believe.

A woman wants some cigars. Okay, normal.
""Do you have your ID?"" 
She shows it to me super easily, that's always a pleasant surprise. Normally someone has to throw a fit or dig around in their wallet for it as if they weren't expecting to be ID'd, but she was READY.
Okay, birthday checks out,, how about---
""Ma'am, your ID is expired. Do you have another with you that isn't?""
""No, I don't.""
""Oh, okay."" I go put the cigars back in the case.
""What, really?"" She yells my manager's name and says that I won't sell, and I yell to my manager that her ID is expired. Manager says I'm right she can't buy without good ID. Lady buys her one item and leaves.

How hard is it to travel with a valid ID? Why are you even driving to our store if your license is expired? I hope you get pulled over on the way home you fool.
This post was inspired by multiple people today who tried to buy without an ID just to keep me on my toes I guess.

The horse ran away and bumped into cars causing windshields to shatter and cars to crash into each other. The horse eventually cut itself on the glass really badly so blood was all over the parking lot. A bunch of Amish men ran outside to calm it down and like an idiot I followed. After a while we calmed it down, said they're sorry even though it wasn't their fault, left the area and came back with a different horse. 

We just left the blood sit and hired a guy to clean it up the night after.

433,I just needed my pen back - tales from the Post Office.,"I was just recently reminded of this story and thought it might fit here.

A bit of back story - Up until a few years ago I ran a retail business which had started out it's life as a Video store in a quiet rural town but over the years it became more a general store as we acquired local businesses that were about to close down - the local post office being the main one in this story, we'd taken it over when it was about to shut down as it was no longer profitable as a standalone business. 

Our two dedicated Post counters were always slammed every Christmas, and I don't know what it was about this particular Christmas but for some reason our customers were more irate than usual and prone to taking their frustrations out on my staff.

As per usual we had massive queues and had one staff member on our general computers - which did the video side as well as straight retail transactions - calling out for anyone just purchasing items, to get them out of the long queues. Anyone doing overseas sending, paying bills, or doing car registration had to come to the two Post counters.

So many people were in store filling out forms, so this particular day *all* the pens had gone walkabout apart from one each at the counters for staff use which we were keeping a close eye on - we needed our pens to finish filling out customs forms and car registration forms, transactions could not be completed if we didn't have a pen.

Customer and his wife get to the top of my queue and they have a car registration form which they need help filling in. I give them my pen while saying with a smile ""this is my only pen, so when you're finished with it I need it back otherwise I can't process your form. I need the pen to finish filling the form out"". He smiles and nods and I help him complete the form.

Then I asked him nicely for my pen back. The customer did a complete 180, I can only assume the drugs he was on suddenly kicked in, he snarled at me and started to aggressively say something so I kindly reminded him I couldn't process the rest of his transaction unless I had my only pen back.

He raised his arm and threw the pen at my head while screaming ""here, have your f****n pen back"". The pen bounced off my face while I stood there dumbstruck and he pushed his way through the incoming crowd of customers and stormed off while all chatter in the store just died.

I remember looking up and seeing customers just stare at me while his wife stood there flabbergasted before apologising profusely to me. I gathered my wits and finished off the transaction managing a smile at her as it wasn't her fault, and politely told her to have a nice day as she slunk out of the store embarrassed.

Naturally every customer after that asked me why he'd yelled at me, and I just said ""I asked for my pen back"" with a shrug. The unintended side affect from him yelling at me was that every customer who was in-store suddenly managed to find their kindness and patience and treated the staff really well for the next half hour or so lol.

But I think the most amazing thing was this guy actually came back a week or so later and apologised for his actions that day, which was incredibly rare! That didn't stop us banning him and his wife six months later when they got caught shoplifting from us by a staff member.",0,1631305332

436,Customer that just had to pay cash,"Happened to me years ago, my first part-time job in university that I recently got reminded of. It was quite fun, rarely did we have any problems with customers (due to very specific business, most were in very good mood)

We had this subscription service, where you could pay monthly fee for a card that got you **HUGE** discounts. If you were frequent customer it was beyond good deal. These discounts had few minor restrictions however, nothing crazy but got many customers confused. Usually we'd just explain it to them and they were fine with it.

One such restriction was - you can't pay with cash. In our country, and especially at our location, cash is such a rare occurrence, that for average transaction handling it costs more than card service fees.

Then one day comes the Angry Customer. It was last shift, I was supposed to close in 10 minutes, and as you all likely figured out already, he wants to pay with cash using discount card. I told him he can't, explained policy, he told me he doesn't care, and basically we went back and forth for few minutes. Finally my manager arrives to count my till for closing, walks over to the customer and asks what's the problem, repeats what I said, and just tells him he can either pay with card, pay with cash without discounts, or leave because we're closing. He finally chooses option 1(**why did you even argue when you had card on you?)**, I ask him to touch terminal with his card, and then he decides to... push my manager away with his arm...

My manager said nothing, smiled, counted my till and I was on my way. That was strange because she's not one to take this lightly, I expected hell to break loose. However, when I was checking in next weekend, she pulled me away and told me, that she contacted corporate and not only cancelled his card, but also banned him from all locations countrywide, along with nice email about how grateful should he be she's not pressing charges for assault.

I was working in Electronics at the real world version of Dane Cook's Super Club. This middle-aged guy came up to me to talk about laptops, a very typical exchange. He gives me enough information to know which laptop he wants, it's just not on sale. Never buy a laptop from Super Club not on sale, because Newegg/Amazon will have better for cheaper. So I pull out my phone mid-statement. The convo went like so; Me: Yeah I definitely think this one will work for you (slightly under my breath) but I don't like that price, let me see here. *Proceed to check if it's on sale but online only, or if Newegg/Amazon does indeed have cheaper* Man: You think this one will work huh? Well I think- uh... He pauses here and I didn't really know why until he continued. Man: I see. Well, thank you for your time. This gets me to look up as I'm not expecting such a turn. As he starts to walk away I realize what's happening. Me: Wait! Wait! I'm sorry I should have explained, I'm looking this up to see if ‏‏‎ this is online for cheaper. I turn my phone to show him before he starts to laugh, then we both share a chuckle as he explains he thought I just lost interest during the conversation.

Boss walks over to me and asks, “Hey Jen, have you had to deal with any lines this morning?” I look at her with a slightly confused expression and tell her that there haven’t been lines- how can there be when it’s so dead? She starts laughing and tells me that someone called in a rage because they “had to walk out of the store because there was a huge line and only one cashier working.” I start laughing and we both realized that the person was calling about one of our other stores, but wasn’t smart enough to figure out that they called the *wrong* store.

451,Humans are descended from apes. Example:,"Tl;dr at the end

So this story happened a few weeks ago. I am working in a small chain business with under 10 stores.

Unfortunately one store wasn’t running as good as it should and management decided to close this branch so the others wouldn’t have to carry this one. 

I was there the last few weeks of existence for clearing out all the stuff and doing inventory. We put a sign in the door window which clearly showed that we are closed and couldn’t sell anything anymore. 

I thought this would be enough information for everybody standing infront of the store.

Boy, was I wrong! Let me introduce you to the humans. Everybody in school learns that the humans descend from apes. For everyone who isn’t believing this, I have the perfect example!

The sign was hanging at a normal head level so everybody standing infront of the door must have had this damn thing right in sight. Some were reading the sign and then knocking on the door, some would ignore it and just try to open a clearly locked door. Oh boy….

Conversation were nearly always like this:

C=Customer

Me=do I really need to explain? Lol

C: „Hey, why are you closed?“  
 Me: „Hey, sry corona had hit us badly and we decided to close this store. I am sorry.“  
 C: „Okay, so I need xyz…“

Me: „Sorry, I can’t sell you anything, my register isn’t running anymore and I can’t access the system.“

C: „And when I give you Cash?“

Me: „Again, don’t have access to the system. I can’t register it.“

C: „Oh, okay. Bye.“

This didn’t happen on 2 or 3 times a day…this happened about 10 times a day. In this time I wasn’t able to do my work and I can tell you, this is extremely nerve wrecking.

A few times, when I was checking my lists I just ignored the knocking and waved to the sign. 

One particular piece of Apeleftovers decided to write an email to management about just waving (not rude) to the sign. 

Congratulations you just gave a statement on mail that you can’t read a damn sign in front of your face.

Oh and have you heard of the „I am important and don’t care of signs whatever these are saying“ people? Well, two of these tried to rush so quickly into the (closed) store that they banged their head right against the door. 

It was pretty funny to hear a solid BANG. 

So, if you ever need to proof that people are dumb, just close a store and wait what happens next.

Tl;dr: Had to close a store thanks to CoVid, people are just to dumb or to lazy to read a simple sign.",0,1631204279

455,Customer doesn't understand the passage of time,"This happened to me a few years ago now, I've never been able to forget it, one of those weird things that just sticks with you. 

I was working in the gift shop at a Zoo, to get my by while I was in college. The shop was pretty big, from one end you can't really see the other end. There's one checkout next to the entrance, its kind of on its own at that side of the shop. Then there's the 3 main checkouts at the other end of the shop by the exit. (This is all important)

Onto the story!

So one day I'm stood at the checkout by the entrance. I like working on that one because its never busy, people don't normally walk through the whole shop, then go back to the entrance to pay. Its an odd place to have a checkout, but I'm not complaining, easy day for me. 

Anyway this guy walks out of the zoo and into the shop. He immediately turns and looks at me.

Guy: ""Is this checkout open?""

Me: ""Yes, is there something you're looking for?""

He doesn't respond and just walks back out the shop and back into the zoo. Bit weird I thought, guy just walk straight into the shop, asks if a checkout is open then walks out. I didn't really think anything more of it carried on working.

About half an hour later my manager comes over and asks me to cash up and go and takeover from someone at one of the main checkouts. I cash up and close the checkout. I turn all the lights off, put a cover over the desktop, and put out the sign that tells people to pay at the exit. 

All pretty clear signs that the checkout isn't open, especially the literal sign.

A while later i'm working on the main checkouts and this guy comes stomping up, I realize its the same guy that came in like an hour ago asking if that checkout was open... you know where this is going.

Guy: ""I've been stood waiting at that checkout for 20 minutes!!!!""

Me: ""Sorry sir, that checkout has been closed, you can pay here though""

Guy: ""Well you told me it was open, now YOU'VE wasted my time!""

Me: ""Again, I apologize but we closed that checkout""

Guy (now more annoyed): ""Well I came in before and YOU told me that it was open, you lied to me""

Me: ""Sir, the checkout was open an hour ago, since then we've closed it. There was a sign that says to pay over here""

Guy: ""Well I didn't see any sign, how am I supposed to know its closed. And why would you close it after telling me its open""

At this point I've had enough, how clueless is this guy. Who in their right mind comes into a shop an hour before hand to see if a checkouts open, things aren't going to be the same an hour later. How could he not tell that it was closed, every other customer had no issue with seeing that. Did he not notice flocks of people walking past with items to pay at the other end.

Me: ""I'm sorry for the inconvenience, again, we closed that checkout a little while ago. I'll see what we can do about making it more obvious that the checkouts closed""

Guy: ""Its just poor customer service, you've wasted my time here, your management are going to know about this. Just check me out so I can leave.""

Me (thought it best not to actually say this aloud): You're damn right they will, my managers gonna love this one.

A very funny and short story. Where I use to work, they sold this type of topping sauce called Hot Mamas Drizzlers. 

I loved the stuff, and decided one day to look up the company to see what other flavours they offered. 

So at the customer service counter, two other workers were next to me doing their work, and I unfortunately typed into google the brand name only which was “Hot Mamas.” 

I looked away for a moment after I hit search to check something else, when one of my coworkers said “Uhhhh OP. You may want to redo the search.” 

I looked back at the monitor, which as you can probably guess, the screen was filled with images that were not safe for work. I quickly closed the page, with already my coworkers laughing and teasing me.

3. We also have self checkouts in our store and today was a bit busier than usual. This woman started complaining about how all the self checkouts was being used and she had to wait on line as if it was a big shocker that she has to wait on line.

461,Local Homeless Threatened Me and Smoked M*th Blatantly in Front of My Store,"Disclaimer: this is my first time writing a story on Reddit, so I might be writing too much. 

This story is mainly about my two unfortunately memorable run-ins with a local homeless individual near my store. I work in my family owned store that is in a plaza with a well-known Asian supermarket. The individual from the title is a African American male who has been around this area for as longer than I have work in this store, about two years. During the first months of working at the my store, I had always felt bad for this person especially when he was outside of a bakery, that I unhealthy frequent. I would give him, or the others who usually asked for change, a couple of bucks or the leftover change I had. At least half a year later, I come back to my store to find this man screaming obscenities and apparently squaring up to cars and chasing some cars, on foot, in the parking lot. Basically causing trouble and making a scene for no discernible reason. After chasing another couple of cars away, making them park further away from the supermarket, he is still cussing up a storm and power walking, as much as he can in his baggy pants. Since, this scene could drive off some customers and make them feel uncomfortable or disturbed and already has made passing shoppers concerned, I stood outside my store and confronted him. I’ll try to keep it exactly to what happened:

Him: “F***! (To the open air).”
Me: “Hey! You need to stop!”
Him: “Shut the f*** up! B****! (At me).”

Now, this is one of the first times I have ever stood up and confronted someone before. So I mainly stood there stunned and a bit slack jawed by the intensity of his hostility, until I snapped back.

Me: “You need to stop or else I’m going to call the cops.”
Him: “If you do that, I’ll kill you mother******. (While pointing at me and starting to walk closer)”

Before he got close enough to touch me, a young African American man, who was standing nearby watching, stepped into his path and held him back. While holding him back, the other man said “Don’t do that, I’ll take care of this.” Not wanting to cause further problems and still reeling from being threatened, I didn’t call the police and just proceed to head back into my store and completely ignored them. Thinking about it now, it was also my first time being threatened with it being from twelve year old COD players. As for what happened afterwards, nothing really. Every time I have seen him since, he is either asking for change or riding around in another bike he had stolen. I just completely ignored him ever since that incident. 

However, yesterday he went into my store, in a white dress (it looked like a white summer dress with puffed shoulders), and asked in, a pleading tone, to charge his phone so he can talk to social security. Not wanting to be a vindictive butthole about it, I hesitatingly agreed and let him use one of my outlets for his charger. He then said he would be back for it. I just went back to my work. However before he left, I saw him fiddle with the phone and was confusingly looking at the phone looking for the charging port. It struck me as odd, when I was thinking about it. This is where, morally, I think I did cross a line. I decided to check the phone. It was a Wiko Android phone with no lock and it seemed like everything had been wiped out of the phone. No contacts, no home apps, but it had data. I decided to peek at his messages, but before I did that. I wanted to lock the door and post a sign that I was in the back. Whilst doing this, I can see him, clear as day, using a lighter and heating up his m*** pipe. He was using it behind a pillar, in front of my store. After locking the door, he went up to the door and tried to open the door. 

Him: “What you doing! (Muffled by the door).”
Me: “Just going to the restroom! (While meekly walking away)”
Him: “Nobody is going to come back for the phone! (Then proceeds to quickly gather his stuff and leaves).”

This confirmed my suspicions about “his” phone being a stolen phone. So far I had contacted the local police about the situation, using the non-emergency line. However, they can’t doing anything since he did leave the scene. They did say if he comes back, I should contact them back. Currently, I am trying to contact the numbers in the messages to see if I can get the phone back the to the original owner, but no luck. If there aren’t any response from my messages then I’ll hand the phone over to the local police office. 

Sorry if this sorry is a bit too long for this Reddit. Thanks for reading.

TL:DR: Local homeless went on a screaming fit and chased cars in a shopping plaza, threatened to kill me. Other time, smoked m*** in front of my store.",0,1631145547

It was busy, we were understaffed, we were stressed.

A family came of six came in with young children. Not a single mask worn.

I ask if they could put a mask on, they refuse.

They go back and forth, eventually the store manager comes up, and they're still refusing to wear masks.

I then hear the mother say. ""We are exempt from wearing masks due to a medical condition. Our house has black mold in it.""

I thought that I had heard everything but that was something else.

They're still arguing with my manager when my co-worker briefly lifts up her mask to take a sip of water (It was about 100 degrees today and our AC is not great) and the dad goes ""Look, your cashier just took her mask off to drink water, are you gonna enforce that?""

475,Not sure how these women did so much jumping at their age!," Okay, I'll be honest; this is a long one. I have written, erased, and rewritten this whole thing 10+ times, no exaggeration. I shortened it as much as I could, took out as many unnecessary details that may or may not require clarification and this is the best I could do. I promise it's not your everyday retail story for sure though. Very short TLDR at the bottom though!

This story is brought to you from the customer of the tale with 9 years as a cashier/manager of cashiers and so many things happened within a short timeframe that I'm pretty sure I involuntarily did the head tilt while my software rebooted.

Context: Went to a local food market this afternoon. Their manual registers are operated by a cashier, who takes the products out of the cart herself (there's not belt and maybe a foot of space before the scanner), and passes it to a platform after scanning it where another person bags the items. When everything is done, the person bagging walks the cart to your car, helps load it all up, and takes the cart back inside. No cart returns outside so this reduces stray carts and I guess just this places ""thing"". The cashier and bagger I wound up in front of today were both women 50+. The cashier seemed a tad younger while the bagger was already beginning to hunch over in age, wrinkles and all. I tried to take it out myself but was politely declined. 

The first odd moment was when I was talking about my SO's and I's friends who were in the next aisle over checking out. Somehow, when I said, ""That's my boyfriend's best friend and business partner with my wife. She's pregnant after trying for a couple of years."" They somehow heard, or at least concluded with what they did hear, ""That is my boyfriend (or ex, they weren't sure) and that girl is pregnant too."" Took a few clarifying questions and TONS of confusion on both sides but I think they finally got it or just gave up trying. 

I gave them the benefit of the doubt though. It was pretty busy so there was plenty of background noise and I'm assuming they are at least beginning to have a hard time hearing. They had to lean as far over as they could and so did I just to hear me. 

The second was immediately after the ""confusion clean up"", the cashier told me how she had mistaken a lady earlier today who was really beautiful and just pretty but when she asked her when her baby is due, the woman replied, ""I'm not pregnant, just fat."" Which in my opinion, asking a woman if she is pregnant or *any* variation that implies pregnancy is a HUGE no-no. Unless explicitly told so, NEVER assume someone is pregnant just from their looks. 

Again, I just passed it off as cultural differences due to age and all that and moved on. Time to head outside. 

The third case was on the walk to my car. Again, I tried multiple times to not make this older lady walk out with me on a still-hot afternoon but every time they insisted. However, the entire walk from the front doors until she was walking back inside was entirely consumed with her digging into my relationship status and history. I'm guessing it was on her mind from the debacle inside and I'm an open book so I don't mind the third degree. I was more entertained/floored by her:

1. Saying ""you gotta be careful who the father of your kids are. Most of them will leave you to care for the child,"" after telling her I have three kids and before she knew they all had different dads. Which she still asked if they were helpful or present and surprised when I said two of three are.
2. After already being told I have three kids and the first was from my first marriage, she gasped and asked if I gave my kid up for adoption when my first husband left me right as I was beginning to suspect being pregnant with my first, which he knew about. Uhm...no ma'am. You obviously know mothers can parent alone and survive considering your active opinion on modern-day fathers so what in the actual eff made you think I gave up a child I already told you I have?
3. Wouldn't let me give my SO any credit for coming into a family of three kids, with none of his own, and doing everything he can to be the best he can for all of us. She would just revert back to absent fathers anytime a significant other or baby daddy was mentioned. Thankfully it didn't take too long and I was left to call my friend immediately after and let her know my cashiers thought I was her husbands' mistress and she may not want to be friends anymore...lol

479,But you had other money...,"I work in a small gas station convenience store. You have to pre-pay for gas here, and I only mention this because I have an Australian friend who thought that was odd. It caused some confusion with another story the other day. 

Man comes in, ask for $15 dollars in gas. I punch it in and he pulls out this small zipper pouch.

'Oh, he's one of those that fold/roll their bills real tiny.' Annoying, but I can make them flat enough running them on the edge of the counter.

Imagine my disappointment as he opens it, 150 coins spilling onto the counter. All dimes. This man wants to pay for gas all in loose dimes.

Now... I'm not allowed to simply trust people on what they the amount they've given me is. I have to count every last bit of it. So, as I am counting it out, this man pulls out his wallet for some unknown reason, and I can see that he has plenty of other money. But I'm already $8 in, I'd might as well finish, and I don't feel like arguing with him.

I finish counting, and sure enough, it was exactly $15 dollars. He leaves to pump his dime gas, chuckling over his conversation with the man who was waiting behind him. I am left with multiple questions, but no answers.

What posseses a man to do this, other than the desire to screw with someone just because they can?

Does his family just give him all their dimes for some reason?

Did he horribly misunderstand the term 'dime bag'?

How does one end up with that many dimes without purposely seeking them out to pull this sort of thing?

In the end... I'm just glad they were all clean, not sticky and covered in gunk.",0,1630965128

482,The time I almost quit ten minutes into my shift.,"I was a cashier at a store called a ""buyout outlet"". The store sold almost everything, but the stock was completely random. On this day, my first customer was a guy. I ring up his items and He pays with card, which usually isn't a problem. Sometimes the card reader can be slow, and I wait for the confirmation screen before I tell people to take the card out. He pulls his card too early and completely glitches the system. It takes a solid three minutes before I can get it working again.

The whole time He's blaming me, saying that I should have warned him. That our system was crap. My manager is on the register behind me and can hear this guy. I turn around and look him dead in the eyes as the customer tells me to hurry up. My manager says, "" Don't do it. Don't you dare."" ( He was telling me not to quit on the spot. I had already put in my two weeks.) 

I get through the transaction and the customer says, ""That wasn't hard, now was it?""  If that manager wasn't an amazing person, I seriously would have walked out. There were only three employees that night, including the manager, and I was the only cashier.",0,1630940793

485,The issue is…there is no issue,"This was several months ago but another post reminded me of this story.

Background: I work at a dry cleaner and we weren’t accepting cash for about a year because, ya know, pandemic. We did have a system in place for customers who didn’t realize we weren’t taking cash/their card was declined for some reason so they could still pick up their items. 

So one of my regulars came in to pick up one day. He obviously knows about the policy because he brings it up immediately:

Him: I know you guys aren’t taking cash right now, but I’m hoping you’ll make an exception this time. I’ve been having some problems with my card.

Me: Ok. Let me go get your orders and we can try the card.

Him (annoyed): I just don’t think it’s going to work.

Me: That’s fine. We have a protocol for that.

I go get his stuff and start to scan it out.

Him (very annoyed): So you’re really not going to take my cash.

Me: Right. We can try your card first. We have a whole process for when a card doesn’t go through, but we’re not accepting cash at all right now. It’s just a precaution.

Him (full on angry): I just can’t believe you won’t take my cash. I’m in here all the time. I’m telling you I don’t think my card is going to work. 

I’m done scanning at this point and turn on the card machine.

Me: Ok. Your total is $xx. Let’s try your card first and if it doesn’t work we’ll go from there.

He keeps muttering about how ridiculous it is while he puts his card in. I know our reader is fast, but it’s apparently also magic because his card works just fine! A miracle!

Him: I just can’t believe you wouldn’t take my cash. I’ll be sure to explain all of this in the survey they send later.

Me: Oh, absolutely! Did you want your receipt?

I would have gotten a call from a manager if he did leave me a bad review so I guess he decided the typing was too much effort. How do you go into a situation expecting a problem then get angry when that problem doesn’t exist? Of course, the actual problem was that I wouldn’t blindly do what he wanted without question.",0,1630899106

488,Math is hard,"I used to work at a place that is mostly known for its pharmacy but also has a decent selection of beauty products along regular groceries. I worked part time as a cashier and I was quite bored a few weeks ago seeing as I had finished all the chores for the day and was counting the minutes till quitting. Barely a customer all day. 

Finally this guy comes up buying a few cheap items, a drink and a snack I think. Anyway, the total came to $10.78. He says he's paying in cash - no big deal. I go over to the cash screen and wait for him to dig out his money. This guy looked to be around 26, which is important since my store is usually frequented by seniors getting their prescriptions filled and I swear some are faster than this dude. 

He gets done counting his change and hands me a HUGE pile of change, and confidently tells me that is 78 cents. I groan and make a joke about how he is gonna make me do math so early in the morning (I was working morning shift). 

He chuckled a bit and said in a super smug tone, ""Well, y'know....math isn't so hard if you just try... I love math,"". This whole time we had a smug look on his face as if he was used to being the ""math geek"" in the room or something, I honestly have no idea. I counted the change while he spoke. Then I counted it again. 3 times.

""Uh sir, this is 68 cents""

He sheepishly handed me another dime and as he did so I said ""Y'know, math isn't so hard if you just try,"". He got super embarrassed, took his stuff without another word and left.",0,1630891308
489,Customer thought I have the wrong price even though I went to the aisle to look at the tag,"Since I quit not too long ago, I figured why not let off some stress about some of the customers I dealt with over the course of seven years there.  


So I forget when exactly this happened, but couldn't have been three years after I started working at the retail grocery store. I was throughout all my years a courtesy clerk there, the one who helped bag, box, return items, grabbed carts, ect. Basically the lowest of the low on the ladder. One day, the woman who took care of the cigerrette counter, called me over and asked me to take care of this one customer on the phone. I don't know why as she was obviously there for years maybe even before I was born (Couldn't have been older than 20 at the time) but I figured it's part of the job, so I took the phone and asked if I could help.  


The customer had been in the store and bought a bag of dog food, I'm pretty sure she said she bought a 20 pound bag, and said the price was wrong and asked me to go check the price. Now, our store, and all of the stores in the chain, do have a rewards program and if you're registered, it had a yellow tag underneath the regular white saying the member price. I knew the program had times when it wouldn't register the member price, and no one else needed me at the moment, so I said I would check the price and went and did so. One thing about the tags is that they show the amount such as 10 pounds or twenty, and she had given me the brand. I found the specific one she was talking about, double checked that it was the right one, before going back and picking the phone back up.  


As this was easily five years ago, I don't remember the exact conversation, but I had told her the price but then she got upset and told me I must have gotten the wrong tag. I told her that that was the brand and amount of dogfood she told me but she got upset at me more before deciding to hang up. I looked at the coworker who called me over originally, shrugged, and went back to work. Never heard anything else about it.  


I have so many more stories, like how earlier this year I think, there was a guy who wanted me to stop bagging at one checkstand when we were being slammed, to get him an item just because he didn't want to lose his spot in line, or how the other courtesies had let toilet water in the men's bathroom pile into a puddle the time I went on vacation even after pointing out the toilet leaked to a manager and I was basically made to clean it up, female btw, at this time all the other courtesy clerks were male. The funniest moment I would say is that when I turned in my two weeks, store manager had the assistant manager try to be buddy buddy and ease my concerns all day, then towards the end, he thought he could just say we'll wait to see which department we can get you in lol like I had been asking for a department change for so long, and now you're just offering it when I'm about to leave, not even guaranteeing it, just saying ""we'll see"" like you did all the other times.  


I took some time to rest, and may take more as spikes of the current issue are going up where I live and with so many family members being at high risk, I don't want to go out at the moment unless I absolutely have to.",0,1630882755

491,Loud annoying customer facetiming with his friend while I’m trying to return his irema,"So this story was pretty crazy when it happened. I call over the next customer for returns and it’s this guy that has a picture frame as well as some expensive lights. I ask him what the reason for the return is and he’s having a loud conversation with his friend on FaceTime barely paying attention to me. Ok fine whatever. I ring up the return as he continues to be loud and obnoxious. At first I thought his loud volume was because he was angry but apparently he was laughing and having a great time with his pal or whatever and was increasing his volume. This almost seemed like a conversation you would have at a party or something, not when you’re returning an item at a store. 

I should also note that other cashiers were looking over and later on said they couldn’t hear their own customers at the time. A person from a nearby department called too and said they could hear him and asked if I wanted them to call somebody. He also smelled strongly of weed which is fine because it’s legal in my state but it’s not the best smell in the world.

I asked him for his id because it was over $150 and he said he didn’t have it, then quickly went back to his conversation. I called the manager over and we were waiting for him to hang up but he still carried on his loud happy funny conversation oblivious to us until the manager butted in and said we needed the ID. Eventually the manager said I could just return a few of his items that it’s below $150 so we don’t have to see his ID. I said fine and a processed the return and he took his cash and other items and went about his day.",0,1630861149

It was a difficult close. Half way through my shift, I had to leave my warehouse and join my coworkers in the trenches. We managed to get a decent start on closing when the closing announcements came on. I took my post at the EXIT door to bid customers a good evening and explain ""closed"" and ""exit"" to people trying to come in.

Enter old woman. The Great Basin Bristlecone Pine (5000 years old, scrawny) has just walked up to me and is screaming hysterically at me in Spanish. I can handle screaming. I've been in retail for a long time. I'm baffled in this situation, though. 

Primarily, I don't speak Spanish. I know a few words, but none of them are coming out of abuela. One of the managers is ""fluent"" but there was still a break in communication. We got ""daughter"" and a couple of other words. Finally, another associate who is from a Spanish speaking country got there.

The poor lady calmed a bit around a native speaker. The story started to unfold. She was visiting from her country, spoke zero English, and the last place she saw her daughter was in our store. 

15 minutes of slowly lessening hysteria later, from down the sidewalk we here, ""Mami?"" Mother and daughter were reunited and all three (our employee included) had a good cry together. 

For the duration, most of us didn't have a clue what was happening. We only found out later that we were ""kidnappers."" Sadly, that's something like the national sport of the family's home country.",0,1630813393

498,Broken bag? Shocker!,"I used to work at a fairly upscale grocery chain, and NOTHING consistently happened more than paper bags breaking on the bottom and a customer’s groceries falling out. There’s a reason to this! 

For some reason, so many people REFUSED double bags when they had multiple heavy items. Either me or my bagger (if I had one that day) would explain that if they lift the single bag by the handles, it will break. Cue the ‘I think I know better’ ‘Uh huh’ ‘Got it, just bag it already!’ 

As soon as they’d go to lift their multiple single bags all at once, you would see everything just fall on the ground. 

Of course, they’d then have a full blown meltdown, and get the managers involved. Meanwhile, everybody working is slamming their heads against the walls because we keep explaining to these customers that this was going to happen, and they lose their mind when it does.

It was about 9pm at night, and we were closing within the next hour. I was watching self checkout, but also assisting cashiers if they needed help. A cashier called me over to ask a question so I quit watching self checkout for about 30 seconds. When I turn around every self checkout machine is blinking red, and stating that a team member will be there shortly to assist them (the guest). I’m very confused as this point and wondering how this could have happened to all of them. I don’t see any customers around, so I go to the machines to start to clear them. As I clear the first self checkout and am on my way to the second, a guest comes behind me and scans an item. You guessed it, it starts blinking red again. (This sometimes happens when an item has no price in our system). I laugh as I realized this person has just went through every self checkout machine and expected a different result. I walked up to them and said that it won’t work unless I manually enter a price. To which they just replied, “Oh. Okay.”

501,“How Dare You Ignore Business!”,"So for context it had been fairly steady in the afternoon. Just me working in the store, my coworker was running an hour late. I had been trying to get food made as our hot food had sold out when this happened. 

A lady had come up, not to the register  or counter but our small kitchenette space with a 100$. Mind you the kitchen is open plan, I can see everything in the store minus what’s blocked by shelves. So I was keeping an eye on the customers. 

 Lady: I need this broken. 

Me, with my arms literally full of hot food I was in the midst of carrying out: Okay! Just head up to the register and I’ll be there once I put these away. 

It took like a minute or so to put it in the food warmer and get to the register but that was long enough for her to have become snappy. 

Lady: You shouldn’t ignore customers! You have business over here!

Me: Sorry ma’am, I’m just one person, I can’t be everywhere. 

Lady:  I know what its
 like I used to work here years ago. You help the customer first! The customer shouldn’t have to accommodate the employee

Like yeah customers come first but I was in the middle of a thing and I can’t just drop the food to the floor the moment a customer asks for something. Never mind the fact that she should have gone to the register in the first place and not into the kitchenette. Am I supposed to pull money from the fridge?

503,I'm...not a person?,"The store I work at is very small, so unless it's during weeks where we know it'll be insanely busy usually there's only one employee working at a time. This time it was yours truly.

I had a bit of a rush of customers and the whole time I had to go to the bathroom. When the last customer left I waited a couple minutes, then DASHED to the restroom. The store is connected to a larger facility so I have to leave the store to use restroom, but I always bring the store phone and keep an ear out for the chimes that go off when the door opens.

I was just about finished when I heard the chimes down the hall, so I quickly finished up and went to wash my hands when my store phone goes off. I pick up and wash my hands while I answer. 

""*store I work at*, this is OP, how can I help you?""

Silence. 

I say hello a couple times before hanging up, then put the phone down to dry my hands.

Phone goes off again.

Same greeting, no answer.

Oh well, we've been getting telemarketers who mute themselves when they call so I wasn't very concerned. 

When I'm done I jog up the hall and enter the store and spot the customer I had heard come in. Reminder, it's been a minute, maybe a minute and a half since I heard the chimes.

""Hi! So sorry about the wait, how can I help you?""
""I know you were here.""
""Uh...yes?""
""I called. TWICE.""
""Oh, I was just in the bathroom, ma'am. And I answered your calls.""

The customer scoffs and rolls her eyes. ""Of course. I hate when you people do this.""
""...Sorry?""
""When you're at work you DO NOT go to the bathroom. You DO NOT eat or drink. You are not a person when you're working, you do not get luxuries!"" 

I'm in absolute shock.

""I'm sorry for the inconvenience, but my boss and manager are both fine with employees using the restroom when they need to. I'm the only one here, and I'm sorry you had to wait.""

The customer looks at me like I just slapped her and whips around to leave the store. She leaves me with a ""fucking stupid bitch"" and then escapes into the night. I'm left confused because I was just told I'm not a human when I work. Retail is strange lol.",0,1630790772
504,You can't use that register- it's closed. But I want to!,"So I work the registers, sometimes the regular ones and sometimes the self check. Now, the self check area is huge and in multiple sections, each of which needs someone to oversee it or it closes. A large area of ten machines needs two people or we close half of them, and a separate belted one that needs it's own person. Sounds confusing? It's generally not. The cashier pushes a button, the machine lights up in red, the screen glows red with a closed sign. We might even string chains across the belts. It's obvious. 

That being said, some people are oblivious. In the main area, I have frequently had to tell people to go to another register as they try to repeatedly scan at a closed register. When I'm busy, I can't always direct traffic. That usually goes over fine, just with a bit of embarrassment. But the other day was something else. I was at a regular register right up against the belted self check. They were closed since we didn't have enough staff. However, there had been a big spill, so the chain had been removed so that the floor cleaner machine could go through. He had forgotten to put it back, but the red light was on, the screen had the big red X on it, everything. And yet, she came. I saw her from the corner of my eye as she started loading the belt. 

""Ma'am, the belted ones are closed."" That got a blank stare. She didn't stop. ""Ma'am, the machine is shut down.""

""But I want to scan my groceries! You won't let me scan my groceries?""

""Not at the belted ones. The other self check area is open. You can go there."" That led to a bit of angry muttering. There was nothing I could do. I guess she thought that if she loaded it, it would open? Then she wouldn't have to wait like everyone else.",0,1630774188

I am lucky enough to say that I had some weird experiences with stupid people but not a real Karen so far (I hope this luck will stay in the future). 
Also my native language isn't english so I apologize in advance.

Background: I work at a bakery with about 15 branches (like separate stores from one brand). We are more on the pricey side because most of the ingredients are higher quality and from local farmers. And every product is selfmade. We have a lot of competitors that are cheaper because they don't do everything themselves but buy products from mass manufacturing.

Story: We have a plum cake which is only seasonal and pretty pricey (3,20€). A woman comes in and buys two slices. She pays (6,40€) and gets the receipt. A few moments later she comes back and demands a refund because our competitor is cheaper. She did not ask nicely. She was mad at me for the price like I am responsible for that. 

I told her she can call the number on the packaging and tell them her concerns regarding the price as I am not responsible for that.

She wants her money back. I tell her I can quickly phone my managers and ask if I can refund her. So I call one of the colleagues in the bureau and ask. 

Me: There is a lady who bought some plum cake and says its to expensive. Sher wants her money back because ""competitor"" is cheaper. Is that possible?

C: Is she real? *hearing an eye roll* Whatever, refund her.

So I gave her the money and took back the cake which I can not resell because of hygiene regulations.
I wouldn't have given the money back because if she buys the cake without looking at the price it's her own fault. 

I hope the plum cake from the competitor tasted really bad.",0,1630680040

512,Dude calls cops on us after being busted for shoplifting,"So, this happened yesterday. 

I was at work and was bagging groceries. A SCO cashier had noticed a gentleman walking out with stuff he bought, but also noticed some meat he stashed under his jacket inside the cart. I followed him out the door, intending to ask him for his receipt, but never did. I was about to shrug it off and let my supervisor know.
But then, by sheer dumb luck, the guy comes back in saying he needs aspirin and leaves his cart up front to go buy it. Of course he has no idea we're already on to him. 
So, I immediately wave over my supervisor to inform her of what happened. She calls the store leader over and tells him of the situation, and sure enough, he has meat stashed under his jacket.
When the dude came back up front with the aspirin, my SL told him to get out. Dude started to complain and make excuses, such as him living with his mom, etc. SL and LP (Loss Prevention) associate told him to leave or they're calling the cops. They also tell him they're confiscating the whole cart. This sets the guy off, and he starts accusing my SL of stealing his stuff (ah, the sweet blissful irony). SL tells him again to kick rocks, and that he's not getting his stuff back.
That's when dude threatened to call the cops. SL told him go ahead. I guess this dude thought that by having the cops intervene, they would force the store to give him his stuff back.
As I'm sure you've guessed by now, this ended with him in the back of a squad car in cuffs.

513,"No, you do NOT get to call one of my cashiers the r-word and get away with it","A little backstory. I work as a service manger at a pretty popular midwestern grocery store. I've been a service manger for a couple months now but have worked for the store itself for about 3 years. I've worked in quite a few departments during my time at this store, so I know a lot of the employees very well. One of my duties as a service manger is to watch the front end and overlook the cashiers and courtesy clerks, make sure customers are happy, do overrides, you know the deal. 

Now, while I do have some cashiers and courtesy clerks that are on the spectrum I don't treat them any different than any other employee- and they all appreciate this. I know their strengths and what they are capable of and push them to do their best. With that being said, I protect my employees. I care about them deeply and if a customer even dares to raise their voice at them I am there to shut the customer down and take them away from the employee. I do not care if you yell at me, but do NOT yell at my employees. Most of them are high school students. 

Now to the story.

This one day it was fairly busy in the store, I had most of my registers open and lines were flowing pretty smoothly. I had one of my courtesy clerks covering a break on one of the registers, lets call her Kasey. Now, Kasey is on the spectrum but is a very sweet and smart high schooler. She operates a register very well and can show up all the other courtesy with going outside for carts. She is, arguably, one of my most hard working employees. Now, sometimes she has moments where she messes up, such as double scanning an item, entering something wrong but this is something every cashier does honestly. I see her light blinking so come over to help her and am greeted by a very angry customer and her daughter.

""Hey OP, I scanned this twice can you void it please?"" (It's important to note that anything over $5 needs a manger approval to void. It's annoying but it is how our store works.) I smile and nod, and quickly to the void. It honestly takes like 6 seconds to void an item and enter my numbers for the override, not that long at all. But that didn't stop this customer from huffing and puffing that she had to wait an extra 7 seconds for a void. I back away from the register, not thinking much about it since this is sadly a normal thing we have to deal with. I walk over to customer service to ask Jack, who was working the counter that day, a question when the following happened.

Kasey had finished the transaction and handed the receipt to the customer, who snatched it out of her hand before she pushed her cart aggressively away. I don't know if the woman thought she was quiet enough, or far away enough to be out of ear shot but I heard her clear as day as this woman told her daughter ""I can't believe they let fucking r\*\*\*\*ds on registers like her."" I looked in horror as I saw Kasey's expression fall from her normal bubbly self to sadness. ***Oh hell no.***

I proceed to shove my schedule at Jack and walk my now very angry ass up to this customer. Although this happened about two months ago, I will never forget this conversation.

""Ma'am, I would like to ask you something,"" I say, gesturing her to step out of the way. The woman and her daughter proceed to step out of the way with their cart, the mother still looking very annoyed.

""What do you want?""

""I don't if you thought you were being sneaky, or smart or just plain rude just a moment ago but what you just did is unacceptable. I'll have you know Kasey is in-fact on the spectrum, and both her and myself heard what you just said. You do not have the right to come in here and call one of my workers the r-word and then proceed to walk out without any consequences.""

""Who do you think you are thinking you can talk to me like that?"" The woman honestly looks shocked at the fact I just called her out. I keep my composure and continue speaking.

""I'll have you know that girl you just called the r-word is an extremely kind, and hard-working employee. Honestly, she is arguably one of my best employees. Just because she made a small mistake such as ringing up an item twice does ***not*** give you the permission to treat her as if she is any lower than you.""

At this point, the mother is stuttering and is red in the face, her daughter is smirking and is trying to suppress a laugh as if she is actually glad her mom is being called out.

""How about this. How old is your daughter here?"" More stuttering. I turn my attention to the daughter. ""Hun, how old are you?""

The daughter smiles at me, knowing where this is going. ""Seventeen.""

""Seventeen, huh? Fun fact."" I turn my attention back to the mother. ""That's the same age as the girl you just called the r-word. Now here's a image I want you to imagine. Now imagine your daughter worked here as a cashier like Kasey. Imagine she accidently messes up and double scans something, a common mistake that happens quite often. And in return, the customer your daughter is checking out proceeds to call her a r-word for making a simple mistake. How would you feel?""

Silence. The mother just stares at me, defeat in her eyes.

*""How. Would. You. Feel?""*

More silence.

I proceed to ask,  ""You would feel mad, wouldn't you? Would you be upset that someone called your daughter that?""

A small nod is the only response I get.

""Now, I am going to give you two options. You can either go and apologize to Kasey for what you said and move on with your life. Or, you can leave and I will personally insure that you are placed on our store ban list. Choose wisely.""

I stare at her for a moment before the woman sheepishly goes back to Kasey's register and gives a half-ass apology before dragging her daughter out of the store. I haven't seen this woman again, but I did see her daughter who came back the following week to apologize about her mom and thank me for what I did. Apparently, this girl went to school with Kasey and knew she was on the spectrum, but wasn't in the position to sand up to her mom.

Now, I did *almost* got in trouble for this. One of the store managers was nearby and hear the tail end of the conversation and after words pulled me aside to tear me a new one. Once I explained the whole story to her, she seem a little more at ease with it but still wasn't happy that I called a customer out like that. We never got a formal customer complaint for it, so we don't think the customer summited anything about it.

Customer: Hi, I wanted to check on the status of my sewing machine in for repair. 

Me: Sure, let me get your name and look that up. Okay, looks like it's done! Come in whenever and pick it up. 

Customer (nastily): So if it's done, why wasn't I notified?

Me: I do have a note here saying that you requested a text. The note says that we texted you, and that you replied STOP. 

[We do not have an automated text system, so a human would have written the note, and I bet it was pretty human sounding! ]

Customer: Oh, if they texted, I would have assumed it was spam. I was expecting a call.

Me: Yes, normally our technicians make calls, but as you requested a text, they texted. Do you recall requesting a text?

Customer: Yes, I was driving to the coast last week. I wanted them to text so that I could check my messages at rest stops.

515,"""We stole her car"" Retail experience","LONG 

(Idk how to put the tag)

So I work in a very large retail chain. I'm technically a cashier but even though I've only been working here for about 11 months and I started as a minor and just recently turned 18, I learned a lot of stuff really fast and have been cross trained for a lot of things up front. 

About a week ago the lead on duty for the front end had to take her mandatory lunch in accordance with state law. In her place she left me her keys and the device to run the floor. This is all a normal occurrence by now. I'm doing my normal duties, getting chasiers change, answering questions, covering breaks, etc. 

Enter: Two ladies. These ladies walk up to me and ask to speak to a manager.

Me: Well I'm currently in charge right now, how may I help you?

Ladies: This is way above your pay grade. Call someone else.

Me: I'm not sure what salary managers are currebtly on duty, if any at all. 

Ladies: Well call and ask

Keep in mind they won't come up and talk to the customers unless we get a general idea of what the issue is because they are really busy and some managers deal with different issues.

Me: They'll ask what the issue is regarding

Ladies: The automotive department 

Me: Oh well I don't know what the issue is but they close at 5pm (it's currently 8pm)

Ladies: exactly they're closed and you don't know what the issue us cause you're not paid enough

Me getting tired of this I call over the radio for a salaried manager and say the customer once to talk to them and all they'll say is it regards automotive and I don't get paid enough.

Manager: None of us get paid enough, I'll be right up

Luckily the mask covers my smile. The manager comes up and takes over and I go back to helping the other front end associates. About an hour later I'm on break and I run into that manager and another one. 
They basically tell me I handled it great which was nice to hear but then they told me what happened. The ladies had our automotive department work on their car and the associates had called them multiple times to come pick up their car before we closed, which they obviously didn't.

The ladies wanted their car back but it was locked in the garage and can't be returned till the next morning. The ladies started accusing our managers of stealing their car and then proceeded to tell them that now they have to go break into their friend's house. (They never told me why they said they had to do that but I thought it was hilarious) 

That was pretty much the end of it though, they didn't get their car back and apparently are now cat burglars because of it lmao.

The man then started saying that I could do it on the side and I for quick context I was extremely tired and very oblivious because I just reiterated that we don’t charge 10 dollars for watches, not realizing that he wanted me to do it and just take the 10 dollars without ringing him up until after he left. He again asked if I could please just do it for 10 dollars since my coworker does it for that price and I excused myself and went to my coworker in the back telling them what the customer said. After that my coworker came out from our stores back room and just reiterated the same thing to the customer and the guy left.

528,"The Grapes are 1.99 a pound... Yes, they are.

EL: elderly lady
Me: me

EL: No, I was planning on getting more but no one got me a cart (electric cart) when I asked.

Me: oh, I'm sorry about that, it could be they are all in use, it is a little busy (about 2 pm)

EL: No they're probably outside, I saw the cart person doing nothing. 

Me: once again, I do apologize, but if there's none in our vestibule then they're Usually in use (we have 4 carts)

So I ring her bag of Grapes (weighed about 2.64 lbs).

Me: that's gonna be 5.26.

El: 5.26! FOR JUST THOSE!

Me: yes ma'am.

El. No, that can't be right they're supposed to be 1.99 a pound. 

So I pull out my registered flyer to double check the price (we just started a new sale week so I wanted to make sure that someone didn't forget to take a previous week sign down I also page a supervisor so we can adjust the price if that were the case)

I find the page and it shows that they are indeed 1.99 a pound with the our store card, which she has in so I show her the page.

Me. So the Grapes are 1.99 a pound, with our store cared. Which they did ring up as.

El. Why'd the sign over their say 2.99 a pound?

Me. Oh, that's just showing the price without the card. We have that one up, and next to it should've shown 1.99 per pound with the card.

El. So what'd it come to?

Me. ...5.26?

El. And thats right?

Me. Yes ma'am it...

El. You put that in right?

Me. Yes ma'am, when we put it in it automatically takes off the card savings.

(At this point my supervisor has come over)

I explained to them the situation and they pretty much reexplained what I did again (almost word for word) to the lady.

El. Well that's false advertisement (showing the non card price which was more then the loyalty card price) where's the office I want to talk to someone else. So we voided her order and directed her to our guest service desk. So they could again confirm the math of 2.64 lbs of Grapes times 1.99, totals 5.26...

I never thought I would have a story to fit this subreddit. I was content to just sit and laugh at the stupidity of some people. But alas, here I am, the author of my own sordid tale.


So, for context, I am one of the managers of a small 4 aisle grocery store. My town just yesterday reimplemented a mask mandate, much to everyone's ire. But, rules are rules, and it's better safe than dead, right?


It's been a relatively uneventful shift thus far, a few people complaining about masks here, someone cursing out the town leadership there. All in all pretty standard. Until Mask Man.


I'm outside our front doors when a man walks up. I tell him there's a mask mandate in effect and he needs to wear a mask. Easy, right? Standard procedure.


Wrong.


Mask Man tells me that he identifies as a fully vaxed, fully masked individual. Mhm. Ok.


I repeat the need for a mask, he asks if I'm questioning how he identifies. I sidestep the question, repeating the need for a mask.


He keeps insisting that he IS wearing a mask. This back and forth goes on for an actual 5 minutes. Eventually, he asks me to call my lawyer and ask him about me questioning his identity as a fully vaxed, fully masked man. You know, that lawyer that grocery stores have.


I decline.


He asks for the manager. I am the manager. He is not pleased.


He asks for my name, I give it to him. He said he will be in contact with HIS lawyer about how what I'm asking is illegal, and then do you know what this man has the AUDACITY to do??

531,Me Vs. Brickseeker," For those that aren't familiar with  BrickSeek it's a website people use to find out store inventory &amp;  usually it will list items that are on sale per major retailer &amp;  possibly location.  Sometimes it might be accurate, but I've heard often  it can be incorrect as well.  We had a lot of people (usually people  who use tax exempt on Electronics &amp; were generally resellers) who  would buy expensive electronics &amp; then look for another store to  return &amp; re-buy them if that store had it cheaper (usually items  that our location probably never had or were long gone).

One  day I'm minding my own business at self checkout &amp; I see a coworker  bring around 3-4 iPads over to SD.  I decided to give my device to  another coworker who usually watches the door to be nosy &amp; see what  was going on.

My other SD coworker  had returned the laptop they had originally bought from another  location for around $500.00-$600.00 &amp; wanted to re-buy it because  they conveniently forgot to use their tax exempt in another state.  Uh  no you just got on BrickSeek &amp; saw that our store had that laptop  clearanced out &amp; was supposedly selling for $154.00-$170.00 &amp; I  highly doubt we even had one in store.

I'm kind of paraphrasing here since I don't remember everything verbatim:

Me:  Hey ""coworker"" what are you doing?

Coworker:  I'm just reselling this laptop since they forgot to use their tax exempt.

Me:   You can't do that!  Let me check how much it is in our store.  Yeah  not going to happen since this is a majorly clearanced item &amp; I  highly doubt we have it at that price.

SD coworker:  Why can't they?

Me:   Well with electronics you have to defect them if they're returned,  they bought this in other state, &amp; we don't price match other  locations with the exception of online.

I told him that's not a thing we normally do, because missing a sale by being too early or too late isn't our problem, and he told me he'd spoken to someone on Saturday, which I didn't work. I told him I wasn't sure but come to come in anyway and then immediately texted my management team to confirm they'd told a customer it was okay. The SM confirmed it was okay to do it and I was prepared to refund him the money.

He comes in later in the day and we look at his receipt and he didn't ""just miss the sale"" by a few days, it was a whopping 11 days ahead! Not only that, but he'd bought the product at another store and they had already discounted the crap out of his bill - 3 lines of manual discounts! We told him that if we did the exchange and gave him the current sale, he would owe us more money. 

I'm still really confused why the other location gave him so much off that far ahead of a flyer deal, but I'm also really peeved that he thought he'd get money back on a sale that started over 10 days after his initial purchase. If I go into a business and find I'd missed out on a deal, I'd just shrug and curse my luck, not expect the staff to owe me money over my bad timing.

536,Dude embarrassed himself,"I work at a fairly big chain grocery store. They are branded different in different parts of the country. I live in Ohio, USA for reference. I manage the whole front end from carts, to cashiers,to customer service. Oh, and we do have an off duty police officer at our store most of the time. On to the story. Sorry this is a long one.

I was talking to the police officer when one of my cashiers came up to me with a receipt and a rather angry guy trailing along behind him. My cashier is trying to explain the situation to me and the customer keeps butting in trying to tell his side. My cashier gets frustrated and asks the guy to let him(cashier) explain the situation to me. The customer shuts up and walks away a little. 

My cashier runs self-checkout where people scan their own stuff. He realized as the guy was walking out the door that the customer did not scan his ground beef. He follows the guy to his car (not what we are supposed to do, but okay) and asked him to come in and pay for the ground beef. Cashier clearly sees two packages of ground beef. The guy agrees to come in and pay. The customer puts the rest of the groceries in his car.

Customer only brings in one package of ground beef so my cashier just rings it up twice and the guy pays. After the customer pays, he starts saying the my cashier overcharged him as he only had one ground beef. This is where I come in.

I talk to the guy in a pleasant customer service voice. He claims that my cashier is accusing him of stealing. He is getting louder. I ask if he had one or two ground beef. He said one. I pointed out that my cashier said he had seen two. The police officer comes over and says the easiest solution is for me to go out to the guys car, verify if he has a second ground beef, then go from there. Customer refuses to let me check his car, gets louder, and then asks me to refund him the money and he just won't come back. 

I agree and let him know I can only refund the one that he brought back. He says okay. So while I am in the process of doing the return, the customer (who is still talking super loud) says that my cashier embarrassed him and it was totally inappropriate. The customer said this multiple times. My cashier tried to argue, at which point I said in front of the customer, ""Don't worry about it. Him (the customer) being loud and yelling is embarrassing himself more than anything either of us have done to him.""

They promptly said “no” and that they’re not responsible for covering shifts and I would have to find someone to cover me. I said “okay but I’m new and I don’t really know anyone”. They said that I would get written up since I can’t come in because I’m a new hire and I can’t use any sick hours because I’m not past my 90 days of working there. I decided to just get written up because it’s not worth it risking my health to work and possibly putting other people at risk. 

Over the weekend I progressively got worse, this morning I woke up with a slight shortness of breath and wheezing. I went to get a rapid Covid test by my house, it came back negative. I for sure thought I had Covid but I guess it’s just a really bad case of the cold. 

I work today but I’m still not feeling a 100%, I don’t want to get written up again or put other people at risk. 

I’m honestly not sure what to do in this situation. My old job never wrote us up for calling out sick, especially in the pandemic",0,1630363522
544,I just posted but this one is really good…,"During the pandemic, as you all know, people are shitty. Tempers are short, people are entitled (more than usual, and all-in-all just bad. For the most part.

So having been knew-ish to supervising, I was also knew to deescalation.

So of course one night a customer had to pick my shyest cashier and have a meltdown over how he had calculated the EXACT price of what it was going to be, so he could put it on his EBT card.

Well o came over and thought I was doing a fair job at handling it. Until I offered to call my manager. Which was in a little bit of a exasperated tone.

He didn’t like that.

So my manager comes up and handles it. Meanwhile I’m doing the worst thing I could do and walking back and forth on the front end, just trying to get things done.

Which looks to the guy like I’m taunting him. To which he tells my manager he has recorded me and I should never have been hired. And in fact should be fired on the spot.

After about a week goes by, the dude approaches me and has a smile the size of the Grand Canyon on his face. He almost breaks down and tells me how he’s sorry and has PTSD.

He spray paints little art doodles and brings them into the store for me now.",0,1630358054
545,Lady threatens to report me to Head Office for asking her to wear a sock,"I work in a busy shoe shop. In the Summer, we offer customers nude-coloured, almost see-through ""pop"" socks to wear if they would like to try anything on. The socks are mostly for hygiene purposes as people often come in from the beach with sandy/wet feet. 

I fully appreciate that it can be a little awkward to try on sandals with a pop sock, but it does help to minimise any potential damage to our stock, and as a result, all of our sandals in particular have remained in much better condition over the Summer months than previous years. 

My colleagues and myself must have offered pop socks to hundreds, if not thousands of people over the last 18 months, so it's nothing personal if we ask each customer who comes into the shop barefoot to wear one. 

Today, during a particularly busy spell, I saw one lady take off her walking boot and quickly try to put her bare foot into a sandal. 

I'll be ""M"" for Me, she will be ""C"" for Customer. 


M: ""Hi there, I'm sorry to ask, but could I offer you a pop sock to try our shoes on with, please?"" 

C: *looks visibly irritated, but says nothing* 


At this point, I move from one side of shop to present her with a little box full of unused socks. She proceeds to snatch one out of the box. 


C: *still not looking at me* ""Are these socks clean?"" 

M: ""Yes, they're all fresh, we dispose of them after every use."" 
(This bugs me and my colleagues immensely, as it is extremely wasteful, but the socks are single-use and disintegrate in the washing machine.) 

C: *starts putting the sock on with a disgruntled expression* ""How am I supposed to try this sandal on with a sock, I can't get my toe in?!"" 


(This sandal in particular has a leather toe post/loop, it is a little more difficult to get the toe through the loop with a sock on, but customers usually manage absolutely fine by pulling the sock a bit looser around the big toe and wiggling them slightly to get them through.)


M: ""Most of our customers manage okay, it does take a bit of wiggling though, give it a go."" 

C: *puts her foot about 2 inches into the sandal opening and immediately takes it out* ""I can't try this on with a sock, I have a bunion and they have to fit right!""

At this point, this lady is really starting to bug me. I look down at her feet and study the bunion on her foot, realising that the particular style of sandal she chose is probably not suitable for her as it isn't quite wide enough to accommodate the width of her foot. 

M: ""Ohh, okay...""

I thought I just sounded contemplative in my reply, but she didn't seem to take my response that way and didn't give me time to say anything else. She pulled the sock off her foot in one swift motion and started to put her shoe back on. Whilst she was doing this, I let her know that there was a bin just to her right that she could use to dispose of the sock.

This must have tipped her over the edge somehow, as she then proceeded to THROW our sandal back onto the shelf in a tantrum-type manner. 

I just gaped (behind my face mask) at her behaviour, as our stock is high-quality and I thought the action was quite disrespectful. 

The lady then turned on her heel and walked straight past me. As she got to the door, she turned back, still not looking directly at me and said, 

""You'll be lucky if I don't report you for your attitude!""

And then she left, leaving me feeling rather baffled. 

I didn't really have a chance to react fully, but I kept hoping she'd come back so I could tell her to go right ahead and report me, whilst conveniently presenting her with our business card and telephone number for Head Office.",0,1630353500
546,“That’s not my problem!”,"Last night I noticed a bag of groceries on the register. I asked my cashiers and service clerks if they knew what the deal was.

No knew, so I took it over to the service desk and left it there in case someone called….and wouldn’t you know, someone did.

The woman described all the item ms I was looking at and told me the correct cashier number (as her receipt was in the bag).

She ended up asking me if I could just call another store and tell them she was going to come get the groceries she left at *my* store. As she didn’t want to drive all the way to where I was. Even though it was something like 15 minutes away.

When I told her I couldn’t do something like that, and her best bet was to either ask for a refund from the other store, or to come get the stuff she left, she didn’t like that.

Yelling, “well I don’t think that should be my problem!” Was a great way to end the conversation.

She ended up not coming back and as far as I know, wanted $40.",0,1630351718

550,Can you go to the back and check?,"I work for a regional supermarket chain that has a ""closeout"" department which sells discounted/seconded/discontinued variety merchandise like tools, furniture, clothing, etc. Basically the whole gist of this department is ""buy it while we have it, because once it's gone it's gone."" I was the supervisor of that department.

One day a customer walks in and asks me if we still had this end table that we were selling a month prior. It ended up being a very popular buy and all of our stores sold out of it in less than a week. My store got a dozen of them and they were gone within hours. Naturally I replied to him ""No, sorry. As a matter of fact I sold out of mine the day I got them.""

So then he asks the magic question: ""Well can you go to the back and check?""

Even though I know it's a waste of time since I have other things to do, just to humor him I tell him I'll go have a look. I head back there, go to the office and have smalltalk with a coworker, then go back out to the floor to find the customer. ""Nope, sorry, didn't see any."" Guy says thanks and wanders off.

Ten minutes later I'm in my stockroom, and a worker from another department comes up to me and asks if we have any end tables back here. With a laugh I say to him, ""That guy again?! Tell him we're sold out.""

Another few minutes roll by, my store's manager walks up to me. ""Hey, remember those end tables we had? Are there any left back here?""

Now irritated, I think I said something like ""Oh for godsakes. Where is that guy?""

I follow the manager to where the customer is and I tell him very sternly, ""Sir, we are sold out of them. I haven't had any for a month. There are none back there.""

My manager was cool enough to vouch for me. ""We combed over the whole stockroom and didn't see any.""

Guy sighs, mutters ""Fine..."" and wanders away for good.

tl;'dr: Customer in serious denial won't take ""we're sold out"" for an answer.

561,"""Sorry, I Don't Work Here."" ""Help Me Anyway!""","A short, little story from my shopping trip yesterday.

I work at a local grocery store, but I don't do a lot of shopping there. I usually do my shopping at a certain blue and white colored store the next city over.

My friend was visiting for the day, so we decided to go shopping together. We're in the hardware section getting me a new 4-prong cord for my dryer when a woman walks up to me. She asked if I could call a manager because this is the ""5th time I've been here when they didn't have garden hoses"".

I told her I can't get in touch with a manager because I don't work there, but she kept going. My friend and I were trying to get back to my house soon since the cord was the last thing on my list, so I told her for a second time that I didn't work at this store.

""Well, you work at (my store), and people shop there too, so what's the (f word)ing difference?! Help me anyway, or I'll call your manager about you being rude to a customer!""

I just laughed. I told her my actions off the clock don't effect my actual job, and even if they did, I wasn't being rude by telling her I don't work at this store. She let out an angry huff, turned around, and walked the other way. I could hear her the next aisle over talking crap about how I wouldn't hear the end of this, my mom didn't raise me right, blah blah blah.

All in all, folks, if you see someone you know works somewhere else in a different store, don't ask for help with the different store's situations. They aren't responsible for that. It's rude. If it was the usual ""I can't reach this"" or ""which of these do you prefer"", I would've helped, but not for managerial problems or orders not being done.",0,1630262393

573,last day on the job,"all summer i've wanted to be rude to a customer.  as part of my job, they basically harass me all day, asking questions about things i really shouldn't be expected to know and usually insulting my competence if i can't answer.  since today was my last day, i was looking for just the right opportunity to not provide a customer with excellent service and to be dismissive or rude.  surprisingly just the right opportunity came up!  someone phoned to ask if we still had maple trees for sale.  'do you have any maple trees?'  'yes, we do.' 'how many?' 'three or four.'  'well, is it three or is it four?'  'three or four.'  'can you go check?'  'no, i can't leave my cash.  i'm a cashier.  sorry, have a nice day.'  

that might seem uncalled for but you have to understand that i really can't leave my cash or call another employee for help since i was already on the line with this customer.  also, we have two days left before everything is packed up and sent back to the distributor.  it's all on sale and every customer has been waiting for these prices, so by tomorrow, there could be no trees at all.  there's not time to be calling ahead, you need to get your ass down here and grab what you want because you're not going to get it otherwise.  

another thing that's bothered me at this job is a manager who has been on my case for every error i made.  frankly, i think she just liked putting me in the hot seat and making me explain myself for every little thing.  i wasn't planning to do anything or tell her off or even talk to her today but, while i was putting a customer through my cash, an incredible thing happened: i made a brand new error that even i don't fully understand.  

i was sort of typing stuff blindly because the customer and i were talking and i wasn't paying attention.  somehow i rang them through without making them pay, which really is an accomplishment since our computer system basically makes that impossible.  knowing it was an error, i re-did the transaction and actually put the customer through properly but good luck to that manager trying to sort out how the hell it even happened when she goes through the system tomorrow, finds this anomaly and can't bring me in to explain it.",0,1630121472

It must be a photo ID, so no Health cards  


It must be government-issued.  So Provincial ID, Military ID, and Drivers Liscenes.  We do not accept Treaty Status cards  


and finally, it must be up to date, so even if you are 20 years old, but your card expired even 1 day ago, we can not sell.  


Of course also making sure the ID is real, failing things could mean a loss of license, a fine, the employee getting fired, or all of the above, with some stores closing because of it.  


This takes us to me, working the last 15 minutes of my shift, getting ready for the person working night coming in, when a customer came in asking for cigarettes.  He looked to be over 30 so I grabbed the cigarettes he wanted when he took his ID out.  I put the box to the side and checked it, and lo and behold, I see that the ID he used, a Drivers License, expired in 2018.    


So I told him that I couldn't sell and put away the cigarettes.  


Thus opens the gates of hell as he got pissed, saying that I never asked for ID and was going to give it to him.  I just explained that he did show ID, it was expired, and that I can not accept it as valid.  


He then tried to get my coworkers on his side, but they all agreed, it did not matter, he showed ID, it was expired, and by law I can not sell the cigarettes to him.  After he realized that he was not getting his way, and we explained that it was the law, he flat out stated ""You don't need to follow the law!""  


My assistant manager bared him from the store and had the phone ready to call the cops if the customer didn't leave, he left, my assistant manager congratulated me.  and I said to him.  


""You know, I would have sold them if he didn't show his ID, he looked to be over 30""

590,Customer yells at me over the phone and gets banned from us for life,"Hello! This is my first time posting here and I’m writing on mobile so I apologize for any formatting issues. 

TL;DR: A customer yells at me over the phone and my manager bans him for life. 

A bit of context:

I work in appliance repair and we often get confused with the actual place that sells appliances. I mostly work on confirmations but also order parts. This story is about one of the confirmations. 

Story:

I’m at work when someone calls my work and they ask about their appliance. This is normal, as people ask about their appliances all the time from us. I ask for their info so I can find their ticket and once I do, I pull up their warranty information.

This is the conversation to the best of my memory. For me, I’ll use PK, for the customer, I’ll us CX.

PK: Good morning this is *redacted* how can I help you?

CX: Hi, I wanted to know what’s the status on my appliance?

PK: Sure! What’s you information?

(He then gives me said information. Once I got it, I imputed it in and pulled up his warranty. I noticed that he had a ticket with us, but in the notes it had stated that he wanted a new appliance, not for us to repair his old one. Mind you, the appliance he had just had one part to fix, which I knew we had in stock.)

PK: Sir, that status of your appliance is currently scheduled to be worked on. 

CX: No, I wanted it to be replaced??

PK: Sir, your appliance has a part broken that we can actually fix without replacing the item! It would be easier for you to just get it fixed. 

CX: No, I want it replaced. It’s under warranty, so I want you guys to replace it.

PK: Sir, we aren’t *redacted*. We’re *redacted* we don’t sell appliances, we fix appliances.

CX: DO YOU THINK IM STUPID?! I KNOW YOU GUYS SELL APPLIANCES-

(Cx continues to yell over the phone so loudly that it nearly blows out my ear drums. My manager, who just so happens to walk by, hears CX yelling. My manager, who will be called Awesome Manger (AM), had been one of the people who personally trained me and didn’t take kindly to people treating his team like garbage, especially when we were just trying to help. He had me turn on my speaker after I let CX know that my manager was here to talk to him.)

AM: Hello CX, what seems to be the problem?

CX: Yes, your worker is an idiot. How can they work without knowing your own policies?! They should be-

AM: Sir, I’m not going to fire them. They’ve done nothing but try to help you. 

CX: So-

AM: Sir, I won’t tolerate you cursing and calling one of my team members names. I can stand a lot, but harassing them is something I won’t.

CX: WHO DO YOU THINK YOU ARE?! I WONT GET YOUR SERVICE EVER AGAIN!!

AM: Okay, that’s fine! You won’t have to worry about us ever again, nor *redacted store*. You’re banned from using us for life and we’ll let *redacted store* know about this.

Before CX could yell for once again, AM hung up the phone in him and let the CEO what had happened.

591,Customer demands product that doesn’t exist,"Tale from my work as a hardware store associate. Not exact words but pretty much paraphrased this frustrating interaction.

Me: “how can I help you today?”

Light Lady: “I need 40-watt candelabra bulbs but the halogen ones are too hot (she needed 5 lights in a fixture, so this is reasonable), so what else do you have?”

Me: “Well, we have these LED bulbs that are energy-efficient, produce little heat, and in two different colours depending on what you want.”

LL: “I don’t want those LEDs, can’t you just get me a normal light bulb?”

me: *confusion as LEDs are by far the primary model we have* “These are the normal bulbs you’re looking for, or are you looking for one of our standard A19 bulbs?”

LL: “NO, I don’t want those LEDs, the filaments are ugly and I don’t want to have to look at them, don’t you just have a normal light bulb?”

It was at this point that my brain short-circuited because:

- Every LED bulb has filaments that look like that.

- If by “normal” she meant incandescent, those bulbs would not solve the heating issue in the slightest.

- We do not sell fluorescent candelabra bulbs. Nobody does from what I can tell. There is no market for them.

594,Blackout during my shift,"This happened over a decade ago. I worked as a cashier for a big box hardware store. Store was built to withstand a natural disaster and had a backup generator. 

While working, we lose electricity. While other stores are closing up and sending staff home, our manager starts the generator and staff get a quick on the spot training. Floor staff follow customers around. If customer puts something in their cart, the floor staff member writes down the item number and price on the item with a black marker. When customer comes to register, cashier fills out a form of item number, price and calculates taxes and total with a calculator. Customer gets the yellow copy and we keep the white copy. Customers can only pay cash or check. 

It is time consuming, but most customers express gratitude or surprise that our store stayed open instead of closing.

Guy comes up with a few items. I don't remember what the items were, but they were not critically important. I start writing up the form and he asks what am I doing. I explain that the store is running on generator so none of the registers have the power to work. He is visibly annoyed. When I finish writing down the items and start punching numbers into my little calculator, he asks for a discount because of the inconvenience and had to pay with cash. 

I admit to being thrown off because of the extra effort by corporate and my fellow coworkers to stay open during a blackout. I find out later that literally every business closed up except our hardware store and one gas station. 

Just then, everything turns on. Blackout had only lasted a few hours. I smile and say there was no more inconvenience. I made the guy wait til my register powers up and I check him out as normal. Guy was still visibly annoyed, but didn't fight me on it.

600,Dumb customers,"I used to work for a well known British holiday resort for 4 years in the onsite supermarket.  The baskets were always located next to the door, surprisingly just like every other supermarket.  I'm sure most visitors would conveniently forget their brains while there.  I'll list the various mindnumbingly dumb questions I was asked.
1- walk around the shop with arms full of goods then come upto the checkout then proceed to ask where the baskets were.
2- do pretty much the same thing but drop all the goods on the counter then ask,  ""can I pay here ""?
I so badly wanted to respond ""where else do you think you're going to pay?""
3- we had weighing scales next to every cashier yet people would still ask "" can I weigh this here?""
4- we had a hot counter selling pies and such. There was the hot counter with everything labelled up that you could see through,   2 ovens and 2 sinks and a small sideboard with napkins and various condiments on.
People would still ask ""can we pay here?"".
5- similar to number 4 except people would look through the hot counter and could easily see what was currently on sale but they would still ask for what we hadn't got.
6- we had signs everywhere stating that we gave cashback on card transactions yet customers would still ask the obvious ""do you do cashback
7- similar in that we had signs stating that we didn't sell gum and explained why yet we would still be asked why",0,1629845794

603,The Phantom Stereo,"The story about the woman who tried to return a radio from a burned car reminded me of something similar but different.  This was a zillion years ago, but it could have happened yesterday given today’s customers.  In fact, it probably did, somewhere. 

Got called over to customer service on a guy that wanted his money back on his car stereo and wouldn't take no for an answer.  I get there and open the box to take a look at the product and it isn't there.  

C = Customer

Me = Me


Me:  Without going into any other details, sir, if you are going to return something, you have to bring it in.  

C:  But I don't have it.  

Me:  Where is it?  

C:  It was stolen. 

Me:  I'm sorry, but we can't give you your purchase price back if you don't have it.  

C:  But I can't use it anymore.  It is of no use to me.  So I want my money back.  

Me:  I'm sorry, sir, but we don't insure products.  We can take it back if it is defective and the other conditions are met, but we can't give you money back on a stereo that you don't have.  We can't help you.  

C:  But it's no good to me anymore.  

Me:  I advise you to contact your insurance company.  They **do** insure things and perhaps they can help you out.

He finally left, but I expect he was there because he did not have insurance that would cover that theft, and car insurers will usually not insure add-on products for the cars they do insure.  Felt sorry for the guy, but that was the most ridiculous customer service request I've ever seen.",0,1629841344

605,"That location is closed, who do I sue?","For background: I work for the corporate headquarters of a national retail store. Our stores are privately owned mom &amp; pop stores that join our corporation for ""purchasing power"", marketing and other member perks. We don't have any say in the day-to-day running of the stores, that's not how our contracts work. Suffice it to say, we don't have a customer service department and we don't handle  customer complaints outside of taking the customers info and passing it back onto the store.  We don't have our 800 number listed as its for members only, but we do sometimes get calls  from customers that are able to locate our local number. Also, a lot of times customers in the local area will search for a store and our address pops up so they call to get directions and we clarify that we aren't a store and give them the closest stores phone number. 

Onto the story: I get a call from a woman on our local line, and here is how the conversation goes:

Me: ""Company Name, this is Me, how can I help you?""

Karen: ""Where are you located."" 

This immediately threw up a flag that this wasn't a member store calling. So I asked her, ""May I ask what this is in regards to?"" 

She snaps, ""I'm asking where are you located, just answer the question."" 

Great first impressions, lady.

Me: ""This is the corporate headquarters located in City, State, may I ask what this is in regards to?""

Karen: ""I have been calling your location in Other City for over a month, I called five times today alone, and no one ever answers. They are closed down. Look up my order from over a year ago and tell me what I purchased.""

Me: ""I'm sorry, our stores are all independently owned stores. We do not have a master database with purchase information. Looking at my records I see that store is still an active store. I can take your information and reach out to the store to contact you.""

Karen: ""They are closed. What am I supposed to do?""

Me: ""I show they are still an active store. I can take your information and look into this for you.""

She continues to insist the store is closed permanently. I re-iterate that I have to look into it. I manage to get her contact information at some point. But I am most definitely loosing my patience and I don't have to take any abuse from her. She is yelling and accusing me of not being helpful. I explained that we have no control over stores or how they are run and don't have access to their information. 

Somewhere in her rants she says, ""So if I wanted to sue, I wouldn't be able to?"" And I'm thinking, No, you couldn't sue us, that's not how that works. If a store closed and you're angry and want to sue, it doesn't come back to us. You might be able to sue the manufacture of the product, but good luck.

I finally snapped and told her to stop yelling at me. I laid into her, but I don't even remember all that I said because I was seeing red. Then I hung up on the lady. My coworker a couple desks over was looking at me with a Pikachu face.

I did pass the information onto the store, which coincidentally was STILL OPEN.

606,I want it free! At a convention!,"I've posted before. I own a small boardgame company. I'm not a ""real"" retail guy (props to those who are), but before the pandemic, I attended 2-3 game conventions a year and of course we have a booth and I'd help sell our product there, along with other team members. No doubt we'll return to the conventions once the black clouds lift completely. 

TL, DR; dude wants rare item free. Gets a refund instead. Comes back later looking for a deal and gets the reverse. 

To help y'all to understand, normally our goal at a convention is to sell 100% of our product that we brought. We HATE shipping stuff back to our warehouse. SO much that on occasion we'll sell excess stock at a slight discount on the last day (Sunday). But usually we sell out. Another important thing to remember is that our games are highly desired, and they are often out of stock online, so people are excited to see these rare games in person at the convention where they can pick one up at last. Often people will buy an extra copy to take to a friend who couldn't make the trip.

Anyhoo, here I am at a game convention and That Guy shows up with one of my Highly Desired but really expensive games. But lo and behold there's a ding in the corner of the box. That Guy wants a discount. My argument here is, ""You already bought this game. The time to ask for a discount was then.""

That Guy lays down the law, ""Either give me a discount or a refund.""

Me ""No problemo, pal"" and I give him a full refund. IN CASH. That Guy is amazed, but takes the money and walks away. I had no evidence he'd even bought that game at the convention, but I didn't care, because I knew we were going to sell out. 

Then I find out what That Guy's sinister plan was. He comes back on Sunday to see if he can pick up a copy of Highly Desired game at a discount, because it's the last day. Lo and behold we have only 3 copies of Highly Desired Game remaining and in fact we are considering price-gouging because people are literally fighting over who gets the last copies. We don't though. That Guy asks for his discount because it's the last day, and instead I sell all three remaining copies while he watches. ""Gotta wait in line, buddy."" He even looks at the boxes to see if one of them has the dinged corner but no, because I sold that one like an hour after he turned it in.",0,1629826699
607,I demand to return these!,"I got called over to customer service with an angry looking customer, so knew this would be a fun one. The associate there had been at the store even longer than I and gave me a strange look as I came up, so I knew something weird as up.

Instantly she started spewing venom about this associate, how awful they were, how they couldn't do their job, etc etc. I just asked what the issue is, and before the associate could respond the.. what I then learned was a Karen.. interrupted and said she just wanted to return these brown hand towels that SHE. HAD. BOUGHT. HERE. 

Associate looks at me funny again, and says maybe I should take a look at these. I look them over and immediately see tags still attached belonging to a competitors store. I explain to the Karen that she must have been mistaken, showing her the tags and reminding her that competitor does have a store just a block over, but regardless I can't authorize the return of an item we don't sell, and never have AND that belongs to our competitor.

Standard I'm never shopping here again rant. I give her the apologetic ""I'm sorry to hear that"" response, knowing 99% of the time I'll see them in the next day or two. 

Two days later a department head is angrily storming up to me, and what do I see.. but those brown hand towels. Turns out Karen had come back and demanded to speak to the store manager. He didn't want to deal with it so just ok'd it. Even after being shown the tags. I dug out the paper work he signed and made a copy because.. it's retail, cover your butt.

Next week District Manager is in, and I'm always assigned to open when he's in. He likes me, and I'm the ""responsible one."" But he wanted to know why the hell we ok'd taking something from the competitor. I asked for a moment, dug up the paper, and showed it to him and told him what had happened. 

Turned out to not be the brightest of ideas though, I guess at most the store manager got a slap on the wrist if anything, but he also found out it was by me. While he'd already disliked me, it got worse after that, but that's another story.",0,1629826172

I mention to the gentleman calmly ""sir I can't have you bring that in here. Can you leave it up here?"" He ignores me and rushes into the store. I ask a second and third time. At this point he's vanished and I pull out the walkie and ask for a manager to immediately come to the entrance. I explained the situation and they went off. Several employees started to look for him but couldn't find the individual to no avail. Five minutes pass. Ten minutes pass. At this point I'm starting to become anxious and thinking 'I'm not gonna get shot or blown up today so yall better find him.' Thankfully nothing happened.

613,Can you replace my Radio?,"TLDR at the end.


Lady calls one day to ask our warranty policy. I tell her that as long as she has the receipt and the packaging we can replace or repair her radio (we are a car stereo shop).

She tells me that the box and the receipt are slightly burned but she has them and you can clearly see the relevant information. 


After a short pause she tells me that there was a ""small fire in the car""

So I immediately asked her to come in and let me see what's going on so we can assess her warranty claim.

She walks in an hour later and the following conversation occurred 

C= Customer

C - ""I was told that the box and reciept were needed for warranty? I have them here""

Me - ""Yes ma'am, can you tell me what happened with the car? Did the fire start at the radio?""

C - ""Oh no, my husband left his cigarette lit in the ash tray and some buts in there caught fire. Unfortunately it almost completely melted the dash and destroyed the radio along with it. We junked the car because the whole front half was basically gone.""

Me - ""Wait, so.. I'm confused, what is it that you wanted to do today?""

C - ""I need a new radio for my new car. ""

I almost laughed...

Me - ""Ma'am, your car catching fire is unfortunately not covered by the warranty. I'd be happy to offer a discount as a return customer but I can't just give you a new radio.""

This is when she turned into the Gorgon

C - ""Well maybe you should have said that over the phone! This is ridiculous! I paid for a radio and you told me if it stops working within a year you would replace or repair it! You can't repair it because it's burned but you could replace it! And you wont!!? Well FUCK you - I'm never coming back here!""

Then she left and I never saw her again... good riddance 😁

TLDR 
Lady tried to get a free replacement radio because her old one was burned in an unrelated fire but because we said we would ""repair or replace""  the radio for a full year she thought she should get a free one.",0,1629740944
614,Rescanning a paused SCO purchase,"So last night, someone paused this lady’s self checkout purchase, probably because she had a motorized scooter with a million things tucked into every part of it. I pretended the machine was frozen and explained to her I would rescan everything so that she wouldn’t have to do it all over again. We talked a little throughout me rescanning, I was saying things about how the SCO machines are unpredictable (lol) and she didn’t seem upset. The total didn’t come out any different, I had just scanned her expensive stuff first whereas she was going to scan it last before her screen got paused. I finished rescanning, and walked away. After she pays, she tells me and the other person in SCO (who she had no interaction with) that we were both “very rude”. I went out of my way to scan all her stuff again most of which was heavy like sodas or pool cleaner and was nice the entire time, so I’m mostly just confused. To me, being rude would have been telling her to go to a register, or even worse explaining that someone watching thought she was going to forget to scan everything/intentionally steal. I was actually nicer than I usually am at SCO because we were about to close and there was nothing else for me to do except help her. I guess nothing is ever enough for some people.

TL;DR I *politely* rescanned $250+ of a woman’s stuff at self checkout, reassuring her the whole time it wasn’t her fault, just for her to call me rude after.",0,1629740910

619,A member came in wanting a refund for a TV she didn't have with her.,"This one is from years ago but will forever stand out to me as the most ridiculous experience I've ever had in retail. I worked for a big wholesale retail company that's membership based for a combined 4 years. My last year in the company I worked in the electronics section primarily selling cell phones but occasionally I'd need to cover the sales floor and advise on television/other sales as needed.

One day an elderly woman came in with her husband. Her TV just broke and she was looking for a new one. The member explained that her old TV had screen issues but she liked it because it was easy for her to connect an HDMI to it and her watch her Eastern European news channels on the screen itself. I'm like that's cool, you can get a Vizio that has built in Chromecast capacities so you can mirror/cast things from your phone to the screen. We spent like 2 hours discussing her options. The women's husband was disabled and she was elderly so i told her to buy online to have it delivered to her house or to purchase the straight to home delivery service. She did, and that was that.

A week later, this woman comes in on a complete rampage. She explains she can't get the TV set up, that I lied to her about what it could do (while also explaining she hadn't actually plugged it in), and that she wanted her money back. Problem is, she didn't have the TV with her. So she wanted a refund on a TV she didn't even come in with! My manager explained to her she needed to bring it in, and that she'd get fired refunding a product that isn't in the store. The lady scoffed and said ""well I'd risk it if i were you because I'm upset"". My manager, trying to level with her, was all ""i have kids to feed I'm not getting fired over your TV"" and the woman replied ""we all have kids to feed"".

The lady called me a bitch for selling her the wrong TV for her needs but also said I was smarter than anyone else in my department because she had come in and asked my other coworkers about TVs and they didn't know what to tell her (my 3 other male coworkers we're not normally very helpful). Meanwhile, her husband was in the parking lot playing with the birds to avoid this drama.

TL;DR I sold a TV to a woman one time in my retail job and she proceeded to try to get a refund without returning the item.",0,1629715363

621,No mask but fast,"So this is really short but still worth telling. Also I'm on mobile.

I was taking care of the stuff people leave at the front before checking. Like fruits and vegetables that have some spots or things customers decided they dont want or what ever.
We have to throw some if those things away like the stuff that's no longer good or the things that needed to be in the fridge or freezer. So we have to get those out of the system and supervisor just showed me how to use the scanning device since there is more things you can do with them than just getting products out if the system and it is some what complicated. 
As we were standing a young man ran past us like he was chased by the devil going for the check out zone. My supervisor goes looking for him and as he sees our security jogging to catch that guy my supervisor also goes to see what's happening. 
I keep scanning the products and after some time my supervisor returns. So that young man did not steal anything but he didnt have a mask so he decided it was a good idea to sprint through the building instead of going to the register and asking for a mask, as we do sell them.

625,We sent someone exactly what they ordered and they had a grown up tantrum.,"So I'm a supervisor in a shoe store. A woman had come in and one of our part time associates were on till when she came up. She was extremely rude off the bat but compared to how she got, relatively calm. She was telling our associate that she ordered shoes online through our website and they sent her the wrong shoes. Which is near to impossible because when we do web orders the system tells us no this isn't right if we scan the wrong barcode and it's supposed to be checked thoroughly by two people before we package it. It's happened before if stores are crazy overwhelmed and things get mixed up, but it's EXTREMELY rare and the store gets in big trouble for the smallest error, like a fly away stitch because it's supposed to be in mint condition before we send it away. Her problem? Our unisex crocs have a W before the number to symbolize ""Women's"" and she thought that meant wide and she wanted medium so she thought the shoe was wrong. She continued to scream about how we were gaslighting her and lying to her about what the W standed for. Our signed up members, who don't have to pay anything to sign up, completely free and cardless, and actually get a 10 reward for signing up, get free shipping, and those who aren't signed up have to pay the shipping. She was not signed up and at store level we can not refund her shipping, it's not possible for me to do or I would have done it. We cannot change a refund amount physically through the till. If I had cash on hand, this woman was so ridiculous, I would have given her 7 out of my pocket dollars. I spent upwards half hour on customer service while this ladies eyes burned into my soul to get her her fucking 7 dollars. I didn't have to do any of this for her, that's not part of my job. I was on hold for a long time. Customer service told me they could refund her the shipping on their end, so that's what I told her while I was talking with them both. I provided the number and everything so she could contact them and while she was screaming in my face I profusely apologized for something that was no one's fault but her own misunderstanding.  I was scared she was going to spit in my face, this fucking lady. She was in line so we could return the price for the shoes, and not the 7 dollars shipping which I'm not capable of doing and there was a mother and young daughter standing in front of her and she was just swearing and dropping F bombs left and right, the mother had to turn around and tell her to watch her mouth. This women was in her early 50's, yelling and screaming. Customer service called me back after she left and explained because she got exactly what she ordered, they couldn't refund her the shipping. Which I really wish they'd have told me that BEFORE she left. So I am now terrified for the next time she comes in, holy mother fuck. Like we tried to explain to her many times the W stands for women and has nothing to do with the width and she just got angrier. I told her that I am doing my best and this issue is not my fault but I'm really trying,  she said because I worked there, I'm personally responsible. LITERALLY HER WORDS.",0,1629687264

 One day, she saw people adopting a child in the orphanage, so she ran to his wife and called him

 Elizabeth: John, I want to adopt a child from the orphanage, and I want you to come right away

 John: Really?  Isn't the death of our baby enough for you and don't forget that we have 6 children and we can take care of them

 Elizabeth: But I want to make an orphan happy and fulfill the promise of his mother and father, and I want them to rest these poor orphans

 John: It's okay, I'll come to you

 He reached the orphanage and saw the child who wanted him, and his skin color was tan, so he was disgusted with him.

 John said, ""You only searched for this, why do you want this child?""

 Elizabeth: I saw him and loved him, and you have nothing to do with me

 This child was 3 months old and was raised by Elizabeth and grew up to be 4 years old and this child's name was Raiden

 John decided to go camping with his family

 He was playing with his children the game of searching for treasure and they were all excited and happy and Raiden was watching them from afar and he was living for a moment and imagining that he was the hero who would get the treasure
 Suddenly he went to his brothers

 He said: I want to play with you and get the treasure

 One of his brothers, whose name is Kevin, said: If you want to play with us, you have to be the thief and we are the pirates and their destination is the thief (the liar traitor and not one of them).

 Raiden agreed and went looking for him or they threw stones at him and beat him with sticks and they ran away and then it rained and he was crying and in pain in the rain and after three hours his mother came out of the hut to look for him and found him wet and unconscious and she was screaming and took him to the nearest hospital

 The doctors treated him and he was fine, but every day he remembers that incident and dreams about it and every day he gets scared and screams and remembers the shapes of his brothers as if they were monsters that look like shadows.
 In a chair between the darkness with his head on the ground and thinking about the monsters around him, they were whispering to him

 Rayden was a hard-working boy, the smartest in the whole school, and the teachers called him the Great Plan of America because he loved planning and strategies, and he was the first in his school from the age of 7 to 15, but between all the years he had no friends and he was always a shy person and did not like to talk

 He did not speak or utter a word to anyone, and between the years he was bullied by his brothers and friends at school

 So he was in high school at the age of 16, and he started the new year in high school, days and weeks passed, and he was in the same condition.

 And he was always watching her and seeing her, and everything he tried to talk to her was afraid and nervous and ran away so as not to embarrass himself.

 One day, a school party came and he wanted to invite her to the party, but he was nervous, but this time he was encouraged and decided to talk to her, so he went to her

 Raiden said, ""I want to invite you to the school party, and I hope you'll agree.""

 Jennifer said: Um, I really don't know, but I have no doubts.

 Raiden's brother came and spoiled everything and said, ""Oh, brother, I found you. I want to talk to you about an important topic. Oh Jennifer, hello, just a minute. I want my brother on a topic.""

 Jennifer: It's okay, take your time with him

 Kevin Raiden took him and his friends to the basement of the school, mocked him, tied the ropes, and locked him in the basement laughing.

 He untied it by chance and went looking for things and things in the basement, until he found a hammer and went to the door

 And he broke the door with the hammer, but he got out and ran and fled to the forests and heavy rain crying and hearing voices of whispering and laughter and heavy and terrifying sounds.

 And he woke up in the hospital and his mother was crying, and his father saw him from afar and smiled a malicious smile and said to his mother:

 Raiden: Where am I and what happened?

 His mother Elizabeth says: We called the police and they searched for you and found you in the woods fainting

 And he went home full of grudges, hatred and negative feelings

 And everything overwhelms him with depression, but the boy who was sitting in the dark and whispers comes to him and only wants to kill has woken up.

i had just clocked in, counted my register and made sure i put the sign that says exact change / not accepting $100… and 15 min later some lady comes wanting to pay for her $8 stuff in $100….

i told her i don’t have change for that i just clocked in and she said “what am i suppose to do then i need my detergent” so i told her she can wait a few minutes or come back while costumers give me $20 bills… she waited but the costumers behind her all paid in card WHICH SHE SAW. 

she said “can i pay now” already being rude and impatient. i replied i still don’t have change they paid in card… she goes “what am i suppose to do then” i said idk what you want me to tell you i just clocked in and don’t have change…. she’s like “that’s not my problem i don’t work here there suppose to leave you change as a company” the store i work for is so small here they are mainly in the east coast not west and then asked for my manager which told her the same thing and then called us ugly and poor manager skills..

635,The Serial Drink Spiller,"This just happened to me today. I work in a general store. I had like 10 minutes left on my shift, when a kid comes by and tells me that someone spilled a bottle of soda on the floor. I assumed that if he was the culprit, it was an accident, and I wasn't going to press the issue. If it wasn't him, customers suck, so that also checks out. 

As I'm wiping it up with paper towels, he starts telling how there was also a spill in another one of our stores. I naively tell him ""I think that's just a coincidence. There's not some serial drink spiller going around."" That's when he started saying ""This must happen all the time"" which basically confirmed in my head that this kid spilled the soda but didn't want to admit it. ""Whatever,"" I thought. ""I'm just going to clean this up, then my shift is done."" My boss sees me cleaning up this giant puddle of soda with paper towels and tells me to just go get the mop. 

I go to the back, fill up the mop bucket, and then head up to the front to grab some wet floor signs, where my boss is telling this kid's dad that he was told that ""someone"" had spilled a whole bottle of baby shampoo on the floor in a different aisle, and that he *saw* the kid pouring a different soda directly onto the floor. 

I had to stay an extra 15 minutes to clean up the extra spills he made. Fun fact, when you mop up baby shampoo, it creates so many suds and soapy foam that you have to change the mop water, because the mop water quickly becomes 90% foam.",0,1629577432
636,This seems relevant for the time of year.,"Kind of specific, but this time of year really brings back some memories from my first job. 

I worked in a school uniform store every summer for about 4 years. Wasn't like working in your usual clothing store; we catered for about two dozen local schools and we had to be familiar with every item of the uniform for every one of those schools.

Customers didn't just come in and pick out what they wanted like in a normal clothing store. They would come in, tell us what they needed for which school and we would measure up, then go out back and bring the correct size items to try on. 

I don't know if this is a thing in other countries but here, when a kid starts school or moves from primary to secondary school, coming in to get their new uniform is quite a big moment. Quite often entire families would come in and they'd all fuss over the kid like they were trying on a wedding dress or something. It was quite sweet but it did put a certain amount of pressure on us to not ruin the moment. 

You see, the company would keep records of the most popular sizes from previous sales and they'd order more of those sizes and fewer of the really tiny or really big sizes; they also knew how many pupils were in the schools so they would base the amount of stock ordered on those numbers. And quite often the company would have a deal with the school so that they'd be the sole provider for that uniform. In other words, we only had so much, and you couldn't get it anywhere else...not saying it was the best system, but that's how it was. 

Every year between May and September, things would go kind of nuts. 
We loved the parents who would bring their kids in early, when we had full stock and plenty of time to order anything we didn't have. But...every year, without fail, there would be the parents who would leave it until a week before their kid was due to start school and come in expecting the full works. Our absolute favourites were the ones who had children who were tiny little things, or somewhat taller/larger than average. 

So nowadays, whenever the last week or two of August rolls around, my mind goes back to being screamed at by angry parents and feeling horribly sorry for the embarrassed little kids who weren't going to have uniforms on their first day at a new school...or were going to have to go in wearing a uniform 2 sizes too big for them. I had parents refuse to leave, I had one very angry father rip the phone out of the front desk and launch it at me. I think about the queues out of the front doors. I say a little 'good luck' to whomever happens to be working there right now. 

To any parents who are ever in need of a uniform for their kid...here is my advice; don't leave it until now, because they *will not* have everything you need, and most likely will not be able to get it for you in time, no matter how much they want to. And it isn't their fault, it's yours. 

Take your kid in May; the shop will be empty, you'll get their full attention, you'll get everything you need and I promise you, the staff will love you for it.",0,1629547804
637,Football tackle,"When I was 18 I was a supervisor at a grocery store and we had a lot of incidents of people trying to steal things but here's one of my favourites:

One of the common tricks people played trying to steal things was filling up their own reusable bags and hiding it somewhere at the front end of the store so its easy for them to grab and run. Most of the lanes had chains that went across to prevent this situation but the end lane closest to the door didn't as it was a ""security lane"" (not really sure what they expected a bunch of 15-19 year old girls to do but it is what it is).  The thing about the security lane is someone ALWAYS was supposed to be on it, I'm not really sure what happened but the girl I had stationed there wasn't on her lane and this guy saw his chance and took it. 

In comes my two favourite managers, we'll call them Gerry (late 50's) and Ken (Mid 30's), running after this guy at full speed, I was on a till since I was covering a break so the customer I was serving and I watch out the window as Gerry full on football tackles this man in the parking lot taking him down like 10 feet away from the door.

Thinking about it now the guy probably could have pressed charges against Gerry for assaulting him but the guy had like 400$ worth of meat so it would probably have been more trouble than it was worth.

They ended up dragging this crying man into the store and making him wait for the cops to get there, it was definitely the highlight of my working experience.",0,1629524083
638,"""No, I don't need to hit Skip. I'll put this in my review.""","So I work at a pretty well-known department store (does the word bullseye ring a bell?) and I'm ringing up guests. It's near the end of a full shift, I'm exhausted but still doing my best with customer service, when an old man comes into my line. After ringing him up, I ask if he's a member of our rewards program as per protocol. He says he is, but he doesn't want to type in his phone number since it won't help him for this particular purchase. There goes 1% cash back but I'm not about to argue, so I ask him to please hit Skip on the pad. He fumbles with his card and very matter-of-factly tells me he doesn't need to hit Skip and that it'll skip automatically. Well, let's put him on payroll since he knows our system so well! I go ahead and hit the button for him, explaining that our system changed recently and it won't allow me to proceed with the transaction unless it's given an answer about the rewards program. For some reason, this annoys him. He hems and haws and asks if all of our stores are doing this, since he was just at So-And-So location and they didn't make him do it. 

""I can't speak for other stores, I only work at this one."" Hey, it's the truth, does he really think a cashier has the time or motivation to check the policies of other stores? (Thinking back on it now this definitely went into effect at other locations since it happened a month ago when I went across the country to visit my dad). But that really ticked him off, and he informed me that we'd be hearing about this in his review. Okay, bye! 

Seriously, what the hell did he expect me to do about it? Reprogram the system right then and there?",0,1629523060
639,Back to school and the lines are... unobservant?,"So, it's that dreaded time of year, almost as insane as Black Friday, the time known as Back To School. The lines are long and staffing is short. The majority were scheduled for the early rush. I, on the other hand, had the fun of handling the early evening crowd. Imagine, I'm on a register, there are only half the registers open, and the lines are LONG. Even self check has 15 people waiting. I think I have at least five in my line, but I really can't tell. Calling for more cashiers does nothing; we simply don't have any. And then I look behind me. It was a confusing and, at this point in the evening, somewhat surreal sight. There was a long line at the register behind mine. The gentleman who was first in line was about to put his things on the conveyor belt. And yet...""Sir, that register isn't open.' 

This was met with a blank stare. I pointed upward. ""The light is off and there's no one there. That register is closed."" And with that, the whole line backed out slowly and sadly.

Ages ago I worked in retail. I did love interacting with people most of the times, but every now and then someone came and made me question my reasons.

Setting: national electronics chain, with two stores in our city, normal work hours 9-21:00, but on this day it was Christmas Eve, short day, 9-18:00.

At 18:15 we sent out the last customer, were cleaning the store, normal lights were all turned off, only a couple remained active.

Enter her, the late lady.

- Can I come in and get something really quick?
- Sorry, but we're closed, tills are closed, floor is wet, we're going home in a couple of minutes.
- But I only want a couple of items.
- Sorry, closed.
- What kind of people are you? Denying me entrance on Christmas? What will my family say to me now, as I don't have their gifts?
- Lady, we were opened since 9 AM, the ENTIRE YEAR we were here 12h/day. One does not leave shopping for their loved ones for the last minute.
- Have you no holiday spirit?
- Sure we do, it's waiting for us at home, with OUR loved ones.

While finally giving up, the last bright idea dawned:

- Will you open again today?
- From what I heard, our other store might have a midnight special sale.
- Really? 
- Yup, have a nice Christmas!

As soon as she left the area, the crowd of colleagues burst into laughter, including the store manager.

654,You Only Closed One Minute Ago! Why Not Serve Me?,"A great story from a week or so ago with a customer coming into my work looking to get a new mobile phone. Key thing to understand is that our state is in lockdown so the door to the shop is always locked as per the agreement to allow us to still operate in some form. On this door we have about 10 different signs all stating that we cannot allow customers in store, we have a contact number they need to call to place orders and our operating times which end at 4pm. You cannot miss these signs. We also work with the main lights turned off.

Anyway, we have worked all day and I have completed all the end of day stuff that comes with retail. Closed the til, locked stock away, we all do some heavy cleaning now with COVID and everyone is just sitting around having a chat while the main manager gathers his things to lock up.

As I'm working off a laptop I see a guy come to the door - it's 4pm on the dot at this point. He looks inside, sees people and starts trying to wave someone over to the door. I don't move as I think surely he will see the sign and realise we are not only closed but don't allow customers to come into our store at this time. Surely enough this man continues to stand at the door. Now most people will look inside the shop then read the signs, and we see them take out their phones and either dial the number there or input it into their devices for a call later.

Realising this guy isn't leaving I head over to the door and the following happens.

Me: Hey mate, we're closed. There are some contact numbers on the signs for the 24/7 sales team if you want to hit them up.

Customer: I need a new phone.

Me: Alright, as I said we are closed. Try the 24/7 sales team.

Customer: What time did you close?

Me: 4pm today. I know it's earlier than usual but with lockdown that's the go, mate.

Customer: It's only 4:01?

Now at this point I was floored. He showed me his current phone and stated that it was only 4:01 like this was supposed to be a great reveal and convince us to do his order. I informed him that 4:01 is in fact still after 4pm and we would be going home any minute. After he swore a little but he asked what else he could do. I told him I was going home but he could try that 24/7 number I suggested when he first arrived.",0,1629372830
656,"No, you can't leave the store without paying.","The title is the slightest bit clickbaity, but it's the best way to describe the situation. We have a problem at our store with people not going all the way through with their payment before they leave.
So they'll go to pay with card, but then on the last step they simply won't do it or will not confirm the amount. Therefore, the purchase doesn't go through. 

Policy is that until the amount is confirmed and your receipt is printed, whether you plan on taking the receipt or not, you CAN NOT leave the store. You have to stay there until the receipt prints. Even if the system is being fucky, even if I have to put more paper in my receipt printer, blah blah blah. No receipt, no walk away.

That's where today's experience comes in. A lady, her partner, and their tween daughter walk into the store. Guy is a very nice and pleasant fellow and, after helping his lady put all the items on the counter, goes out to wait in the car.

I ring up the stuff, put them in a few bags and spin the thingy around for when they're ready to grab them. Lady inserts her card, daughter grabs the bags. In the middle of the purchase, card in machine putting in her pin or whatever, the lady says ""Go ahead, [daughter], you can go ahead out to the car.""

Bells go off in my head, I've had people walk out without confirming payment before. (Happened on my first week, made me feel terrible but it all got sorted!) So I turn to the girl and say ""No you actually can't leave yet, hold on please."" And her mom says ""Yes she can.""

Luckily my boss was there and she explained as nicely as she could that the daughter can't leave until the receipt prints, and the lady gets all huffy. Receipt prints, girl goes out the door, I hand lady the receipt and she SNATCHES it from my hand. I tell her to have a nice day and she sarcastically says ""Yeah whatever, you too.""

657,Collect your own damn carts,"This took place close to 30 years ago when I was a Junior in High School and living in Florida.  At the time I was working evenings at a big name Grocery store that was right next to a chain drugstore.  Most evenings, one of my responsibilities was to gather shopping carts from the parking lot and bring them inside the store so they wouldn't be stolen.  I would generally gather the drugstore's carts for them as a courtesy and put them on the sidewalk near their front door.  In the year and a half that I worked there the drugstore never, and I mean NEVER, gathered their carts from the parking lot.  That is, until one evening when there were more drugstore carts in the lot than my store's carts.  So, I took it upon myself to ensure that the drugstore would, from then on, gather their own carts from the parking lot.

About a week later one of my fellow closer's commented on how they hadn't seen any of the drugstore carts in the lot lately.  So I said, ""Yeah, it's amazing how persuasive I can be without saying a single word"".  Puzzled expression from co-worker.  So I explained what I did to achieve cart gathering compliance from the drugstore.  The night their carts outnumbered ours I took one of their carts and and basically folded it into itself and jumped up and down on it until it was no more than a 6"" thick layer of bent, mangled metal and then I placed it right in front of their main entrance.  After that we never had to deal with any of the drugstore's carts being left in the parking lot.",0,1629347561

659,Order? What order?!,"Ah glorious retail. My story takes place a few days ago (mods recommended taking time to calm down before posting, so thankyou) 

A cstomer came to the till asking for a refund for an online order, which she later stated that it was a repeat order and was unable to cancel herself. Online orders need to be refunded onto a card or gift card. 

Me is me, customer is c. 

Me: Pop your card in when you're ready. 

C: I can't, my banks been suspended 

Me: Awh no worries, I'll have to put it on a giftcard. 

C; Nope. 

Me: um, well I have to put it on one or the other as its an online order 

C: well lasy time this happened 2 managers here made some calls and did it on cash. Is that a new policy?! 

Me: sorry, no, online orders need... 

C: *interrupting me* before you carry on with that speil, they did it for me last time. 

Manager: (was listening and hovering) unfortunately who ever did that, did it incorrectly. Online orders have to go back on card or giftcard. 

C: fine (walks off to the person they're with) put it on that one
(I looked at my manager and they nodded) 

Me: Sure! (Transaction goes through) 

C: so just to recap, you couldn't do the refund to cash, but could do it to someone else's card?! 

Me: well, yeah because it's an online... 

C: i don't care about that speil 

They walk off and im just stood there with my manager, confused and a bit shaken. 

I went out the back to calm myself, as I could feel a panic attack coming. I popped to the office and watched the cameras on the till to see if they come back around and pick them up ... As something about the whole incident didn't feel right. After a few minutes and no activity I decided to go grab them anyway, and bring them to the warehouse. 

Remembering that the customer was unable to cancel the order, and that being part of their frustration, I called up customer service - cause that's what we're supposed to do (try to resolve issues for customers) 

While on hold, I happened to notice that the dates on the parcels were for delivery 8 months previous. Odd. 

The manager quietly asked what I was up to, and I said about cancelling them 

Manager; good idea! Good initiative 

Finally got through to a rep; and enquired about the order, using the details on the parcels. Turns out they did indeed have a repeat but for some reason it didn't get shipped a few months previously... I mentioned the date of these parcels, which they found equally interesting and a little suspect. 

We cancelled the order, regardless. Amazing. 

Manager; you alright? 

Me: yeah! It's all cancelled (and relayed what the rep said) 

Manager: I agree, little suspect. I bet the customer will moan now that it's cancelled. 

We laugh it off and I go about facing up (tidying stock etc) 

Huh... They're still in the store - there begins my internal battle of do I just keep quiet or do I let them know - to cover my own butt (so I can say that the customer was aware that it's been cancelled if any issue arises). 

Naturally, I chose the wrong option. 

The conversation that follows is not exact as I've now somewhat surpressed it. 

And remember... They previously told me that they ""couldn't cancel the order online or by phone""... 

Me; hey, just thought I'd let you know that I've been able to contact customer service to cancel your order. 

C: *looks blankly* what order? 

Me: ... Um, the repeat order? 

C: what order? 

Me: the... One... We refunded? 

C: but i cancelled that months ago... 

Me: err... Well it's fully cancelled now... 

C: so you used my details to do that 

Me: uh .... 

C: i don't know why you did something that wasn't asked of you. 

Me: but... 

C; this conversation is over. 

Me: alright. 

Points to manager for foreseeing that. 

I was dumbfounded. What an odd reaction for something that was actually really helpful. And now thinking about it, most 'legit' people wouldn't have blown up like they did - I absolutely know I did the correct thing. 

Conflict always reduces me to an anxious wreckage hah. So once again I retreated out the back, and spoke to the manager and a phew other colleagues that were there. 

All were confused and taken aback by such a reaction.

660,A regular doesn't remember anything,"I manage a vape shop and one of our regulars is a woman who has underwent multiple brain surgeries. The surgeries have left her with severe memory issues to the point where she basically can't communicate anything to you, even the simplest things. Usually her mom shops for her or they come in together, but sometimes she comes in alone and it's extremely difficult to figure out what she's asking for because she'll just describe it as a ""thing"" or give a description that doesn't really make sense. 

I feel really bad for her, she's so sweet and understanding when we can't understand what she wants. Her visit today really broke my heart tho. Our POS system has a feature where if you put your card into the reader, we can pull up a list of all the things you've ever purchased here with that card.

She was trying to describe that she needed batteries to me, but she couldn't think of the word and was saying things like ""it's not for the alcohol"" or ""it's what makes it open"" so I was having a very hard time figuring it out. I asked if she usually buys it when she comes, because if so she could insert her card and I could see it on the list since she's such a frequent customer. 

Her response was ""no, I've never been here before"". I honestly wasn't sure whether I should remind her that she's a regular or if I should pretend I was mistaken. I didn't want to embarrass her or freak her out so I pretended I was mistaken.

I am a head cashier at a large box retailer - that has a policy about not wanting the HC running a registers because they cannot do that and run the floor.  I still am willing to help out the best I can when the need arises.

Last night, we only had enough cashiers to keep SCO running - which actually are pretty nice because they only use a wireless scan gun, great for big carts of large items - like lumber.

I don't recall all the details, but I came up to the SCO area to notice the cashier was busy with another customer and there was one waiting with the prompt on the screen asking for intervention.

I scan myself in and help him out rather quickly and return the lane to SCO mode, then stand and watch the front for a moment.  It wasn't busy, but one of our regulars was standing next to me when the cashier comes up to the guy I just help and we both hear this:

Cashier: Everything going ok.

Customer: No, but I already got helped - even though I stood here watching people walk past that refused to help me.

The regular turns to me and goes:  Is it a full moon or something, people need to chill the f down.  I come in there's a fight over there, and other over there, and now this guy - who doesn't understand that you all work in different departments, so not everyone walking by in an apron can sign into a register.

My only reply to him was this: They see me walk up out of nowhere and do it, so suddenly they expect anyone in the store to be able to - even if they are NOT trained to use the registers, and therefore do NOT have the bar code that scans them into them.  You are right though, we're all separate departments.  If more people understood that, I wouldn't have people calling me over like a puppy to ask a question I cannot answer.

Tbf, I should have just minded my own business, but out of reflex I told this guy that he’s not supposed to be in our overstock bins, but that I can get someone to help him (it’s my day off). 

Him: Do you work here?

Me: Yes, actually.

Him: Well, no, I found what I was looking for. 

Like, dude, it’s not the 90s. You can’t just take what you want from a store and the store will magically know what our numbers are accurate. We have to mark down exactly what is in each location, and if it’s not there it’s wasted time with less people.",0,1629304232

I had a queue of customers up until that time. As soon as I knew which customer was going to be my last that day, I got the attention of the next woman in the queue:
""I'm sorry, my till is closing!""
To which she replied, ""But the shop is closed?""
I wasn't really sure what her point was. I forgot that maybe she didn't know some of our cashiers are rostered to work half an hour after closing time for just this exact eventuality. 
So I repeated myself ""I'm sorry, but *my* till is closing.""
""But the shop is closed!""
I was really confused at this point and said ""I'm sorry, but I'm finished work at nine.""
""The shop closes at nine!""

At this point the urge to say ""Well maybe you should have done your shopping earlier then?"" was almost irresistible so I just didn't say anything.

674,"Ma'am, this is an express lane. Take your $300 order elsewhere.","For some background, this happened yesterday. I'm a teenage cashier working at a regional, privately-owned grocery store, and this is about my 5th week working here. I'm still kind of learning the ropes, but mostly everything is down pat.
So, yesterday, I got to work for a 4.5 hour shift. Not that bad. And hey, my supervisors tell me I get to be on an Express lane; hooray! The one that I'm on is specifically 15 items or less, and that express lane sign is turned on with a separate switch from the one that turns on the sign for the number of my register. So, for the first half of my shift, I'm doing just fine. Then, I get to go on a 15-minute break. When I get back, I sign back in to my till, put back on my light, but when my next customer comes, she has a cart with what looks like 30-ish items. I ask her, ""Hey there, is that 15 items or less?"" She looks pretty bewildered, and says, ""Oh, I didn't think that this was..."" Then, I see that my express light isn't on. Whoops, my mistake. I tell her as such, apologize and ring her up anyways. Right after I turn my express light back on, however, my next customer and her daughter come into line behind customer 1, and have a full cart with what must have been $300 worth of groceries. I ask her if she has 15 items or less, and she clearly doesn't, but she doesn't respond. After I finish with customer 1, the customer with the large order comes up, starts putting stuff on the belt, and as much as I try to explain things to her, she doesn't seem to want to listen. I know she knows the language, however, as her and her daughter are chatting it up constantly. So, here I am, cashier in the express lane, ringing up a $300 order for a customer who seemingly doesn't care, and who is holding up 4 customers who actually deserve the line behind her. When I finally finish her transaction, I tell her her total, and she pulls out a CHECKBOOK. We NEVER get checks anymore. Total waste of our customers' time. Leaves without saying a word to me. I try to apologize vehemently to the customers she held up, and luckily they understood. Still, I guess this is what retail is like.",0,1629227341

679,Gotta have those hangers!,"To preface this: this wasn’t my personal experience, but this happened to a coworker today and it was too good not to share. We work at a popular retail chain and this is from his perspective.

I’m on the register and this family walks in: a father, mother, uncle, and daughter. I ring up the father for some socks and jewelry - no issues there, but its when the daughter comes up that we have a problem. The daughter was around 7 years old and she asked if she could keep the hanger attached to her shirt and shorts. I said, “sorry I cant do that because we keep our hangers.” To which the father replied “no no it’s okay, we always keep the hangers.” And of course
I’ve never seen these people in my life so
I just keep saying “no I cant do that.”

It goes on like this for about 3 minutes of the father and uncle saying “yes you can” or “we’ll take the hangers”, or “thank you it’s no problem.” Basically just insisting that I’ve already done something for them. Eventually they turn this into a 
“call your manager we’re taking these hangers!” And I try saying “no I’m not calling a manager,” this is a stupid request. Of course I didn’t actually say this is stupid, but I did say it’s not something to be argued over.

I sensed that  it’s gonna turn into another back and forth so I called the manager
they explained the same thing to her
saying that I was rude and refused them service of hangers??? And they pulled everyone’s favorite line: “the customer is always right.” 

After some more banter with my manager - who’d already decided to give them the hangers as they weren’t gonna stop until they got their way, they said I should smile more. As an entertainer I did take off my mask and give them a sinister smile
I was semi cosplaying, for anyone wondering, just some formal clothing that’s green and gold with a crown as a headband. They took it as endearing and went about their merry day.

I really didn’t mind that they took the hangers, but what kind of request is that from a store that clearly keeps their hangers?",0,1629164001
680,"If you can’t hear me, take off the headphones. And PLEASE put on some PANTS.","Some things to note before I begin my short story:



I’m a cashier at my local privately owned grocery store. During this whole pandemic thing, our store has taken steps to be as safe as possible and protect our customers as much as we can, this includes our carts being sanitized every time someone new uses them.



Our cart sanitation is this whole process I won’t go into, but it does involve customers lining up, and waiting for a cart to be sanitized for them before they can enter the store. This whole part is run by one employee at a time.



On this particular day, the guy scheduled to run cart sanitation couldn’t do half his shift due to medical reasons. So I was sent out to take over as I have been trained on it, and have a face shield assigned to me.



Now for my story. Being in a small town, you get to know most of your regular shoppers, both the good and the bad. But there is this one guy who comes in every other Sunday, he is the topic here.



This guy has many defining features about him, specifically the hard hat, construction vest, noise cancelling headphones, and he has this pink dog chew toy strapped to the front of his vest. I’ve seen his unfavourable behaviour both inside the store in the isles and checkout, and outside the store on cart sanitation.



On this particular Sunday, he pulls up to the store on his bicycle (recognized instantly because of the pink pool noodle tied in a knot on the back) he hops off and struts towards the doors, I wipe a cart and stick it in front of the door. He has no mask on (a usual occurrence) but today he also DID NOT HAVE PANTS ON



I (or anyone else on sanitation) usually don’t stop him for his lack of mask and immediately call a manager on our mobile store phone, because we know it will do absolutely nothing if we try and intervene ourselves. But today I had to stop him before I even called the manager.



Our conversation went as follows:



Me: “sir, hey! Hey sir! Stop!” I wave my arm infront of him



Guy: “WHAT WHAT DO YOU WANT!?!?” 



I gesture for him to take off his headphones but he doesn’t



Guy: “WHAT DO YOU WANT IM TRYING TO SHOP!!! I DONT WEAR MASKS!!!”



Me: almost yelling “I know sir but I can’t let you in if you’re not wearing pants!”



The guy then swats his hand at me, almost hitting my face shield, grabs his cart and goes into the store. I grab the phone and dial the extension for any managers phone. When the manger on shift that night picks up he barely has a chance to say “hello?” before I interrupt him.



Me: “yeah hey (managers name) that guy with the headphones- yeah that one- no it’s not just the mask he doesn’t have pants on today”



Manager: “what? Is he just naked?”



Me: “no no he has boxer briefs on, super man ones actually, but very clearly not pants or even shorts”



The phone hangs up on me and not 5 minutes later a cop car pulls up to the entrance. The cop and his partner nod their heads at me and walk into the store. Another few minutes pass and I am able to witness the guy being escorted out the doors, I *think* he was given a ticket but I’m not too sure, and escorted to his bike.



Not the most amazing ending but definitely a shift I will remember for a while.",0,1629155392
681,"""I'm just blind deaf and dumb, what do I know?""","So a little context is necessary. I used to work as a bagger/janitor at a supermarket in the Midwestern US, and we had an overwhelmingly larger amount of elderly customers than we did younger or middle-aged customers, so we got something like this happening every now and then. My store would send out ads in the local paper to let people know what sales we have, but the ads themselves were unnecessary for buying anything, since you would get the discount for just scanning your card into the thing at checkout.

That said, one day I was bagging for lne of our older cashiers, let's call him Jim, and this elderly gentleman gets in line and wants to buy a number of items we had on sale that day, and asks how to scan the ad he brought with him to get the discount. I'm barely paying attention at first because I don't realize something funny is going on, but when I realize Jim is calling for a manager because he can't figure this out (he's new and he's up there in years himself), I start listening and asking question, telling the customer that all he needs is his store card, which the manager repeats fifteen seconds later.

He scans his card and pays, leaving the store with the quote ""Well, I'm just blind deaf and dumb, what do I know?"" Which went on to become a running joke between me and Jim.",0,1629153523

TL;DR at the bottom.

Before I started my current career as ""That IT Guy"" I worked in the wonderful world of retail.  This story is from when I worked at an upscale Grocery/Housewares/AllThingsFancy store that was specific to the Southeast United States.  Lets call it...  $NorthernTime.

This would have been +/- 13 years ago during the happiest time of the year (Read:Christmas).

So I'm sure you all know how the Christmas season works when you work retail.  All hands on deck from Thanksgiving until the middle of January (at least that's how it was then).  This was ALSO the only time of the year where Over Time was not only allowed it was encouraged (it wasn't corporate run at the time and they made BANK during the Holidays due in part by the implied status of gifting something from this store plus the fact that we were the only retailer in the state that offered certain items).

I was a full time ""Associate"" in the Housewares department that had been working there for about 2 years at that point.  Since most of the other employees were temporary teenagers that had no idea what was going on other than ""put on shelf"" and ""sell the thing"" it was up to me, the other couple of full timers, and the assistant manager to actually make decisions about what stock would be placed where.

TL;DR: Cheap Bastard tries to game overly-lenient return policy (or lack thereof) to get Christmas items at post-Christmas prices.  I tell him he is cheap because I'm overworked and over the holidays by that point.  He complains and management agrees with me.",0,1629147522

686,Somebody is going to have a very bad day.,"Happened this weekend. I was working the closing shift on the register, like usual, and the weather was really nice after a hot week so most everyone was in a really good mood. Except this one girl.

She was 20 to 25 I'd guess, was browsing around for a while and finally came to the register with a 5 inch folding knife, no biggie. I rang it up and asked if she had found everything she needed. She asked if we sold tasers and I told her we didn't but kind of as a joke told her we had some cattle prods. She thinks for a few seconds and then asks if they would kill a person, serious as anything. I got out of a joking mood quick and told her I had no idea, she thought for a few more seconds and then asked where they were and I told her. She headed that way as I suspended the transaction and went to the next customer.

She must have slipped out the door while I was busy with other customers because I didn't see her after that. I'm not sure what was going on in her life but I got the idea she was really pissed about something and someone was going to have a bad time of it.

687,Can you ask your supervisor?,"I am a european citizen and my native language is not english and because i am on my laptop and i do not have an autocorrect there probably will be wrong spelling or whatever. 

So this story takes place in a local grocery store and i think we are on of the only ones that are open till 24.00h in the city. (We actually have a lot of costumers coming in after 22.00h.) We still have to wear masks when we enter any kind of building or the train.

It was a busy day in general but i didnt have a lot of people in line when the security comes walking in and behind im two boys. At first i didnt realize them talking to me as i had other costumers but then i heard them asking for masks as they werent wearing one. The security is faster than i am and gets them a pack of masks and the costumers in line let me ring them up.

So we have those card devices where you can either just put the card on top and it will transfer just like that or you can insert the card but you can also swipe it at the side. The last option is basically never used because normally all cards have chips and can be used with the other to options. Not the card of the young fellow wanting to buy the mask. But the device at my register was like lose and fixed onto its holder so you wouldnt be able to swipe your card (this sentence hurt my head and i hope its understandable but i dont even know what the things with which the divce was fixed are called in my native language excuse me)

So i have a collegue passing by who cuts up the thing fixing the device so the young man can swipe his card, what he did and my colluege fixed the device back onto its holding. (once again i hope its understandable) i go on with my life but there they are the two young man back on my register which is the only open register with the problem with the card device. The man with the card laughs and says they are back and why i fixed the device because i should have known that he wanted to enter the store and buy things. So i make sure he can swipe his card. But he also wants to buy tabacco which we have behind glass, so we have to get up and get it for the cosutmer. 

But turns out he doesnt want tabacco but a cartoon of cigarettes (whichis ten packs) which we dont have. I tell him we do not have those to which he replies that that cant be true and he is sure we have them and i should ask my supervisor (who clearly doenst has something better to do). I ask over my headset if we have those and as i said my supervisor says we do not have them. so they buy like five packs and some alcohol and go on. 

But here is the thing. They where coming over the border from another country and both didnt have their ids with them (they had someone else buy the alcohol and the cigarettes, since i couldnt check their age) and this young man also had a really weird wound on his head that was actually quite deep and looked like it should be seen by a medical professional.",0,1629135336

689,The deal is the same thing right?,"At my store we always have a good deal. They always change so that customers have a variety of good stuff each time they come, but it can get confusing sometimes. For example, we have buy one: get one free, buy two: get one free, and buy two: get two free. Since alot of stuff is like that most cashiers have to figure out the deals on screen since it’s automatic.

A sweet old lady came into my store today and was getting two sodas. Our deal was buy two get one free and we do ask if they want an extra incase they want the deal. I asked if she wanted another box. She looks at me confused and said “what do you mean? Its buy two get one free right?”. I nodded “yes would you like us to get you a third one?” She looks confused “no its buy two get one free!”, my bagger and I looked at each other confused. My bagger says “um ma’am… you buy two you get another free” the lady looked annoyed “no no I know I get one free”. “I think you may be thinking about our buy one get one free deal-“ she kinda yells “NO” and She pulls out a flyer with soda labeled “Coke products; buy two: get one free” she looks at me and with the upmost confidence says “Im a math teacher, I know how this works”

Huh?????

I felt she was confused and wouldn’t accept that you needed a third for the deal to work. I ended up giving it to her for free with manager’s approval. She leaves. The next customer behind her comes up confused after hearing our conversation.

I feel like I should of explained that better, but then again she felt so certain she was in the right. Just feel so confused in that conversation…",0,1629124202

Now the scanners at the place I work don't always boot right at the start of day, so they error on the first scan then take a couple seconds to get working. So I do a small joke where I lightly hit the top of the scanner to get it to work, naturally it doesn't do anything, but to someone who doesn't know it can be funny. 

So when I was interacting with this customer the scanner hadn't booted right, so I did the joke and after the scanner worked the man said:

First at me for some reason, then she started screaming at her son to put back his drink. He started crying and she started screaming more and threatening him.

Another woman, customer B, saw this and ran over to intervene. She started screaming at A not to scream at the kid and how she was humiliating him. They argued back and forth for a bit before A stormed out of the store. B got back in line, I checked her out and thought that was the end of it. 

Not too long later I hear a lot of noise from just outside, followed by loud screaming and crying. I run out to investigate and find A on the ground screaming with her kids also crying loudly next to her.

Apparently customer B came outside and just started wailing on her. She punched A in the head multiple times, pushed her into the public trash can (which was knocked over) and slammed her head into the wall. Judge from the giant bruise on her face I had no reason not to believe her. Cops and ambulance were called, apparently A has seizures and was worried the beating might set them off.

700,Follow your gut feeling.,"This is one of the moments that I worried and was scared. (Next to old men hitting on me.).I was spraying carts and using the tablet to count people as well as handing out masks. when I saw a man walk in with a bang bang weapon. (I’m calling it bang bang because I don’t know if I’m allowed to say the weapon.) We had to report this over the walkie talkies. About 5 minutes later cops showed up. This was different because usually a security guard just follows them around. But, my gut told me that the cops needed to be called and that this man didn’t have a permit or good intentions. So they called the cops even though usually we don’t. Because they believed me which made me happy. The cops then were stationed at the front of the store about every three to five checkouts and worked their was back towards electronics. We were told to stand behind this wall in case it got dangerous. We saw the man walking around hand on the weapon. Calling this into the walkies. They got the man and he had stolen multiple games and was planning to steal a PS5. The man was crying as he was handcuffed and out into the cop car. He didn’t have a permit for the bang bang. This man had been planning to do anything for the ps5. I realised if I hadn’t called it in the situation would have been worse. All the schools saying, see something say something really came in handy that day. I know people have the right to carry bang bang items. But we had a threat so we were told to say something this would just have a security person keep an eye on them. We didn’t confront them the only one ever confronted was this guy. This was because that was the way I profiled/judged him. Unlike everyone else who owns a gun his wasn’t in a holster it was stuck in his pants. He kept trying to pull his shirt down on the side the gun was like he was hiding it. He also kept looking around and trying to avoid eye contact with employees. When he walked by his eyes stayed on the security office door. Those things had me a little worried which is why I called it in. Having a bipolar schizophrenic Mom, who becomes paranoid he was doing similar things. It was just a situation that my gut told me something was wrong. I was right to follow my gut. So always follow your gut because it might just save you or save someone else and help prevent a disaster. He also had stolen like $3,000 in stuff so it wasn’t ending well for him.

702,Customer Won't Let Bully Take All The Clearance Meat,"I've worked in the meat department at grocery stores for over 15 years.  Many years ago at one of the stores we had a policy that around 1 or 2 PM we would go through the sales case and grab any meat that was expiring the next day, and mark them all down to around $1.
There was one regular customer we had that our clerk called ""The Meat Bully"".  He was an older gentleman who would arrive in the early afternoon and watch us like a vulture until we brought the reduced product out to our clearance section, and then fill his shopping cart with almost everything (for some reason he never grabbed any lamb or veal).  We had a number of complaints from other customers about how there was  nothing left in our reduced section, but also because ""Meat Bully"" would push others out of his way to get his precious cheap meat.
There was another regular customer, ""Farm Woman"", an older woman who lived on a farm, who one day decided to do something about our clearance problem.
As I was putting reduced prices on the product, I noticed both Meat Bully and Farm Woman waiting and watching me, and giving each other the stink eye.  Once I was down I brought the rack out and put the cheap meat into the sales case as fast as I could.  When I was done and backed away the two of them went right at it, pushing and shoving each other, grabbing whatever meat they could and tossing it into their carts.
After a minute or two the clearance section was wiped out and they walked away to continue their shopping.  Over an hour later Farm Woman came back and put most of what she grabbed back into the clearance display.  I came up to her and asked, ""Is there anything wrong with this?  Did you change your mind?""
She smiled at me and answered, ""Oh no, there's nothing wrong.  I just didn't want (Meat Bully) to take all your cheap stuff.  This way everyone else has a chance to buy some.""
I sighed for a moment and smiled, ""I appreciate the thought, ma'am."", but then grabbed a couple of packages she had put back.  As I suspected they were room temperature.  I continued, ""But we can't sell meat that's been unrefrigerated this long.  Unfortunately we'll have to throw this all out.""
""Oh, I'm sorry."", she muttered, frowning as she realized that her good deed had been for nothing, walking away glumly.
Thankfully Farm Woman never tries that again.  A few weeks later the company would change our clearance policy to where we didn't reduce the prices so drastically, and though Meat Bully continued shopping there he wasn't nearly as aggressive.",0,1628990219
703,Try Again.,"This story happened a few days ago and I still get a bit of a kick out of it.

To set the scene, I work at a grocery store as a cashier. It’s about 6 PM, and we have several checkouts open at this time. Things are moving along without issue and it’s just the slog of greet, scan, pay, repeat.

I come to the end of another order and the customer tells me he’s paying with credit. Sounds good. I do what I need to do on my end and wait as he does his stuff. An error message appears. Not unusual, sometimes they’re actually using a debit card, sometimes they take the card out too early. However I had never seen this message before. “Try again.”

That’s odd. Well we just got new registers so maybe it’s just rephrasing one of the old messages. It’s clear as day, so I inform the customer we need to try again. He’s fine with this and we proceed as usual.

“Try again.”

Right then, let’s try again. We redo the payment yet again while the customer and I begin discussing what to do if it doesn’t work again. At this point I flag down a manager for help and they just yell over “Try again error?” Slightly annoyed.

It was at this point that I looked up and down the checkout to see this same scene repeated at every register. One of the customer service employees who had come out to see what was happening just started going “Oh no. Oh no no no.”

The entire card processing system had gone down.

The poor managers. They start making phone calls while all us cashiers just have to stand around and inform our lines of what was happening. The guy I was serving didn’t have cash and the managers were a bit busy so my line was going nowhere fast. Everyone just resigned themselves to wait and see what would happen next.

Thankfully, they must have gotten to the right people because a few minutes later it comes down the line to try running card again, so we repeat the age old song and dance and hooray. It’s working again.

So definitely an anticlimactic ending, but there was definitely a scare there. I can only imagine what would have happened if we hadn’t gotten the system up again.",0,1628978312

I personally would see drive-offs a few times every time I worked, so I was happy to see the change. Customers, however, resisted the change as much as they could from threatening to not get gas here anymore to get me to turn on the pump for them because our system still allowed it for semi-truck drivers that use special cards to pay.

One day, a lady I never seen before (our Karen) pulls up to the pump, and grabs the nozzle, expecting me to turn on the pump for her. I announce over the speakers the same speech I've been giving everyone that won't read the prepay signs on the pumps, and continue to wait on other customers in my line. 

She ignores me at first, but hangs up the nozzle after a minute and makes her way into the store. I finish the customer between her and me and she starts in at me about not letting her get gas outside. I politely tell her we're a prepay only store now, and she'll have to put money into a pump before getting her gas. She seems confused at first, but we get through the transaction with her putting in $30 unleaded onto a debit card and she heads out to pump her fuel. She doesn't put the whole $30 into her vehicle, and heads back in to speak to me.

After I get the customers in-between me and her, she wants the cash for the fuel she didn't used. Now, it my bad for forgetting to tell her gas prepays on any card are automatically refunded once the nozzle is hung back up onto the pump. I tell her this and I have no way to give her cash back from the transaction, mentioning it may take a day for the refund to appear on her bank statement. She gets mad, demanding I give her cash for the fuel. I repeat myself, apologizing for the misunderstanding and say she still has the money; it's just on her card. She leaves the store, and I think I'm done with her. Nope.

I continue on my work in-between helping customers in the store for several minutes and I look  outside. A cop has pulled up to Karen's car and she's talking to him, occasionally pointing at the store and I already see the headache coming. I tell my co-worker to run register as the cop comes in and he asks to speak to me. I greet him and ask what he needs. He informs me that Karen called the cops, saying we were refusing to give her her money back for the fuel while being really rude to her. I tell him what happened, how refunds for gas work, and if he wishes, he can come back with me to the cameras to watch the footage.  He says that's okay and he'll inform her of what actually happened. I don't see the cop and lady talk as a rush hits the store then, but one of my regulars saying that lady flip me off after she got into her car so the cop wouldn't see her do it.",0,1628978037
705,"""I have been abused""","So, this is a story that mostly happened to a co-worker of mine, but since I was involved as well, I thought it was worth sharing.

&amp;#x200B;

A couple of days ago I was working the register when a woman, her husband and their 3 children came up to me. The woman, let's name her Karen for no reason whatsoever, asked me where she could file a complaint because she had been abused. I explained to her that we have a front desk where they handle complaints but she didn't seem satisfied because she asked who my manager was and wanted a description of what she looked like. I told her my manager's desk is at the front desk so chances were she'd be over there. She asked if it was that woman she saw earlier wearing a cardigan. I had to stop myself from sarcastically replying that yes, sure, she's the one woman in this whole building wearing a cardigan. As I explained for the 3rd time where she should go with her complaint, as I'm not qualified to deal with that, she continued yelling that she has never been treated that way, she didn't know what she did wrong and that she was completely shaken because she has been attacked by the personnel. I told her I don't know what happened and rang her up, while she was shouting at me for not even asking her loyalty card (she never gave me the chance to actually ask her inbetween her ranting). 

Now, after all of that, you'd think that she really had the worst experience one can have while going shopping. At the time I really did not know what had happened, but I found out the next day and well... prepare for an anti-climax.

We have a lot of students working their summer jobs at my workplace. One of the students was working at the clothing department at her desk that happened to be in an aisle. The thing about working in retail is, there often is no place to work at where you aren't in the way of the customers, which usually isn't a problem because there are other ways to pass by or they could just ask like decent human beings. 

Karen's husband walked behind the table the student was working at to look at some clothes. That student was looking at Karen, wondering if she also had to be there or was just waiting on her husband. Out of nowhere, Karen started shouting that the student was looking at her ""aggressively"". The student went up to my co-worker, in tears, to tell her what happened, so my co-worker decided to go up to the aisle to see what happened. She asked Karen if there was a problem she could help with, but she just continued shouting, saying that she had no way to pass by and that the student was purposely blocking her. My co-worker calmly explained to her that there were many openings through which she could pass by, but Karen didn't believe her and her husband also got upset because of ""how his wife was treated"".

After going to file her complaint at the front desk, Karen insisted that the assistent store manager would go to the clothing department with her to demand an explanation. She belittled my co-worker, saying that she was scared to tell her employer the truth. My co-worker said that she had no problem  telling her boss what happened, but not while Karen was still there. 

About 10 minutes later, she passed my register again to proudly announce that she went to complain as if I was supposed to congratulate her. I just shrugged at her and was happy to know that that woman would be the joke of the day.",0,1628967789

707,Homeboy doesn't like my customer service - the Sequel," Greetings!      The saga continues of Graveyard shift at the gas station, O'dark thirty adventures ;

Thursday night, a regular customer who's been coming in for months, came in to buy his regular thing of a pack of Marble-O Black cigarettes.       He always buys those cigarettes; sometimes he also gets a soda; sometimes he gets a lighter but it's always those cigarettes that he buys.       Not Thursday, no.     Thursday, he angrily marches up to the counter and starts swearing at me words that I can't post here, but censoring out the profanity he says, ""Hey!      You've been giving me attitude and I don't like that!        Did you shut off my gas the other night!?""       The one word I got in edgewise during this whole exchange was, ""Yes.""      

Homie continued his ranting and cursing saying that that wasn't right; that he was going to report me to corporate because I ~~was a @#$%\^&amp;\*+={%$#!!!~~    ...gave bad customer service, and he stomped out.

&amp;#x200B;

What happened:

&amp;#x200B;

Flashback to late Monday night- Homie came to the teller window and asked for his Marble-O cigarettes, as per usual, *and* wanted to pay for some gas.       Slipping two $20 dollar bills into the drawer, he said that he wanted the cigs and $20 bucks at pump #10 too.        Now unfortunately, due to the thick safety glass, all I heard was that he wanted gas at the pump, so I rang up the cigarettes, then rang up the remainder of his forty ($40) dollars, about $30 bucks, to pump #10.      As I gave Homie his cigarettes through the window drawer, he asked, 'Where's my change?'

Realizing my error, I turned back to the register and tried to void the transaction before the pump turned on.       That managed to stop the signal, but also caused the old register to freeze up.       A few tries to get it unfrozen, failed and I had to tell Homie that all we could do was wait for the register to unf\*\*\* itself.       Not happy cuz he had things to do, Homie replied that he'd go pump his gas and come back and get his change in a minute.        Not waiting for my explanation, he took off to find out that the pump wasn't going to work, for himself.

Homie returned pissed off now, and just wanted his money back for the gas, saying he'd go across the street.      He had wanted $20- in gas, so I gave him back one of his $20- dollar bills.       ""Where's my change!?"", He demanded again, so again I tried to explain that I couldn't get change out of the register because it was frozen.     Now, Homie was demanding *all* of his money back!        

""If you want it all back-  then give me back the cigarettes, okay?"" was my reasonable reply.       He was not okay with that, but wanted his money, and tossed the cigs in the drawer.       To which, I returned his remaining #20-.              

Off Homie stormed to his car, and of course, *that's* when the register came back to life!         Ping! went the register, and Ping! went pump #10, which had finally been activated.        What to my wondering eyes did Homie do?       He tried to take the gas!        He had the fueling nozzle in his hand and was about to put it in his car and BEEEP!   ...I turned off his gas pump.  

Yup, Homie may not have liked my customer service, but I was *not* going to give him free gasoline.",0,1628935468
708,I messed up :(,"Heyy. I’m new to my job and started just under two months ago doing two night shifts a week at a petrol station, I work alone. Anyway, I had finished a 12 hour hospital shift for my uni course (7am - 7:30pm) and was scheduled in for work at the petrol station the same night (which I agreed to) from 11pm to 7am. I was exhausted, to say the least. I found myself making a lot of mistakes with the money and nearly giving customers too much change (they were honest and said it was too much so that wasn’t an issue), which isn’t like me at all. 

When printing out a voucher code for a customer the printer had an error, and for some reason it didn’t occur to me to just reprint the receipt, I just redid the transaction. This meant that the till was £15 down. I feel absolutely terrible, I’m trying my hardest to manage everything and took on more than i could handle. Just wanted to vent really, it’s getting challenging to manage all of this at once.",0,1628924896
709,A good day for a picnic?,"When I was younger I worked in retail management for about 3 years, tons of stories to potentially share but this one is the one that I just have to share! The store where I worked was basically in between a senior living facility and a halfway house so we got all sorts of goofy clientele! One day about 4 weeks after being promoted to management I got to work and noticed a regular client walking around with her daughter. She had been known for being a little off so to keep an eye on her is what I was told. I couldn't believe my eyes in broad daylight while looking at toys her and her daughter sat down in the middle of the aisle and pulled out a picnic blanket and sandwiches! I was a bit shocked to say the least and was halve tempted to just let them eat! Needless to say I had to ruin their picnic and give them the boot!",0,1628908659

We hired a lot of kids that were straight out of high school and they were usually irresponsible and didn't want to work. We hired Jack. He seemed to be one of the more hard working people we had hired in a long time. But after so long he started calling off a lot. After 3 write ups, it was automatic termination at our place and at this point Jack was on his last chance. He called in saying something about needing emergency surgery and we told him ""ok, but make sure you bring in a note so we can excuse this"" After his next shift, a note was found in the managers office. It was a green post it note, written in Jack's handwriting stating that he had been at the hospital having emergency surgery and was to be excused from his shift.

We did (registered post so we got confirmation of a signature, and disguised inside a parcel so that it wasn’t obvious what was being sent). 

This morning we got a parcel back. A lovely hand written thank you note with a book from my favourite author (that had come up in conversation when they were in the shop).

716,Dude just dropped and item off and walked out with another instead of doing an actual exchange,"At work yesterday this guy came in with an unopened deodorant and said he got the wrong one for his wife and asked if he could exchange it. I said yes of course, and he asked if he could leave the old one at the register so he could grab the correct one. Thinking nothing of it, I assumed (like any reasonable person, or so I thought) that he would grab the new one and then come to the register to complete the exchange. Wrong. His wife met him a few min later, they grabbed the new one, and just.. left with it. 

Has this guy never shopped anywhere in his whole life? Like, ever? That's not how you do an exchange. I tried to get their attention as they were leaving because they stopped by the door for a moment to say something to each other but as I tried to say ""hey aren't you doing an exchange?"" But they ignored me and left, and were gone before I could get a manager to the front. 

I could maybe understand more if it was a small boutique store or something but I work at a large chain store, so it doesn't make sense. I'm still trying to wrap my mind around this one.

717,impossible customers,"every now and then i get a customer who is so instantly upset by something i say or do that it really seems like not having upsetting them would be impossible.  for example, the other day a lady walked into the garden center where i'm a cashier and asked me, with a little hostility, where our peonies were.  i said i wasn't sure if we had any and asked if they were perennial or annual because we'd definitely not have them if they were annual.  just this upset her.  

customers don't seem to understand that not every employee knows everything about the store and that some of their questions can only be answered by asking the right person.  as a cashier, i am that wrong person to ask.  i am not intimately familiar with our stock since i'm legit not allowed to leave my cash and don't get to see where things have been moved or added or run out of stock throughout the day/week.  she said they were perennial and i told her we'd just gotten a shipment of perennials in so if she wanted to take a look around, she'd be getting first pick.  this was too much and she got nasty.  'well, of you're not willing to come show me what you have in stock, i don't see why i should even shop here!'  at that she turned around and left.  just left.  through the parking lot, i could hear her yelling 'this is the worst customer service i have ever had!  unbelievable!'

i mean... why did she even come in?  i mean, that's a pretty big shift to make from 'fully intending to shop' to 'leaving in outrage' in like thirty seconds if she was actually intending to shop.",0,1628817068
718,A run for my money at an INconvenience store,"So back in the day I was working for an In-convenience store back in the day. This place wasn't in a necessarily rough neighborhood (I've worked much worse in the past), but there were just enough High School and College-Aged kids to get real annoying real quick. This particular store has doors that lock with the push of a button behind the register. Pretty cool actually, and important detail for later. Also an important detail; my manager's a genius, so they have me put a big stack of beer right by the front register. You know, so the beer run guys can see how close the beer is to the door from OUTSIDE.  

Curly Haired kid comes in after just walking around the parking lot for twenty minutes, and my spidey senses are tingling. I know this dude is going to Beer Run me, I just know it. He comes to my register and asks for a cigarette that happens to be very far up on the shelf. I've had this happen before; someone asks for something that's hard to reach and when I turn my back they're gone. Not THIS time... I then press the door lock button (which makes a very loud ""clack!"" at the location of the door(s) which was my way of letting him know that I knew what he was doing.  

Well, he evidently didn't notice, despite my sighs, despite my exaggerated movement towards the button. I was thinking to myself (the best person to really think to) ""What does this kid think I'm doing?"" Maybe he was desperate, whatever, but as I turned around I hear a way-more-satisfying-than-anticipated THUD!!! as this kid, with an 18 pack in hand, slams into the locked doors. This kid was ON THE FLOOR, I have no idea how the 18pack in his hand didn't break. He then kept slamming against the door with his body, saying ""Open this door, open this effing door right now!"".  

Time for some “next part of the story”

I see this kid come back towards one side of the store and wind up to plow through this door. I know this kid's gonna break the lock if he doesn't stop doing this....  

He makes one last long run at the door and then I press the unlock button last possible second. The kid flies, literally FLIES through the doors swinging open, tumbles to the ground outside, finally the 18 pack breaks, rolling everywhere. The kid picked up like four beers and just kept running.",0,1628800362
719,Retail gods hit me in the face with irony,"Before my shift started this morning I figured I'd buy something since I had some extra time. I brought it up to the register and as I was about to get cash back I asked 'do you have any 20s in there?'

Three things you should know:

1: It was about 8 am meaning the registers would be fairly empty as many people hadn't been through. 

2: Our registers start at 100 dollars

3: The max on cash back is 20 dollars at my store

So when I received the answer 'yes' I hit the 20 for cash back, not wanting to wipe out all of the 10s in their drawer. Oh boy, here's where the retail gods wanted to show me my place.

About half an hour later I count my drawer and get to my register. The first guy comes up and everything goes normally. He pays with card and asks for 20$ back. Okay, that's inconvenient as now I have no tens but it's not the end of the world as I still have 5s. 

The next lady comes through and she's very nice. We go through the transaction and she pays with card. She asks for 20$ back. I pull out 20$ in 5s, a look of pure pain trying to come on to my face. Then she says ""Oh, I guess I should've asked first. I have a 20 in my wallet."" PAIN. 

So then my mind is whirling. I only have two 5s, some ones, and change at that point. How am I going to check these people out? Then my savior comes along. Wonderful lady, a gift from the gods. Pays with three 20s. She will be remembered. 

So basically, that's how the retail gods gave me an ironic beat down and succeeded in stressing me out in the first 10 minutes of my shift. I just found it funny how I MADE SURE to ask because it was super early and the first two people in my line wipe out half my drawer.",0,1628798446

721,Worker Expects Me To Know Where To Deliver Just Based On A Name.,"So this happen today. And I’m glad I snapped at the coworker. Usually I’m a pretty quiet person. Whenever there’s a mistake, I don’t normally snap or get angry or anything like that. I just keep to myself. 

This worker, he makes mistakes all the time. And they aren’t small mistakes either. They are a big mistakes that often cost time and money. For example, this is something I’ll put in a future story, but the summary is, he put down I had to go to a certain town just over an hour away, to deliver something, when in reality, where I had to go was less than a 20 minute drive away.  

This coworker, just give you an idea, he feels like he’s a big boss, even though he’s not. When he makes a mistake, he tries to hide it, but when others make a mistake, and minor ones no where near his size of screw ups, he’ll give you crap for it.  

I don’t take him seriously if he gives me crap for a minor mistake I make once in a blue moon because they are nothing compared to his. 

Today I had a load of building materials to take to a contractor. So the bill I had, on the left side, there is the contractors name and home address. The left side is usually for account information to know who it’s being billed to. The centre column, is the ship to column and when that’s empty, you delivere to the account address, which was what this form had. The ship too column was empty. 

And on the right side of the form, is info, like who made the order, what the contractor wants as a PO, etc. 
So I drive out to the contractors home address, which was about a 30 minute drive. When I get there, the contractor is not there but his wife is. 
I told her that her husband ordered the stuff and my info said to delivered to his home address. She was confused, because she thought that order was supposed to go out to the jobsite he’s at. 

I phone the contractor, and he says it was supposed to come out to the jobsite, and he told me where it was. Luckily I haven’t unloaded any of the material yet, so I told him I’m on my way. So I had to drive 20 minutes back in the direction I just came from to get to where this contractor was. 

So I get the contractor his material, and I asked him “When this worker was doing the order, did you tell him it had to come to this address?” He said he told my coworker where it had to come. 
So when I get back to the store I was burning red. I checked with a few my yard guys, just to make sure they weren’t told something I wasn’t. But they all told me they were never told it had to come to that address that wasn’t on the order. 

So I go in and I see the worker, and I asked him “Did the contractor say it had to go to address B.” He told me yes, and I snapped right there. I said to him with my voice raising a little, “Why isn’t it on the order form?” He then says “I circled the name of the person.” 
I look in that PO field that I mentioned earlier, and I see a random person‘s name, but no other info. All it was was a name. I raise my voice more, and said to him “A name doesn’t help me. I have no idea who this guy is. Where he lives, or anything like that. Even if there was no address yet because the property was still under construction, there should be some sort of description like he’s a long road A, near intersection B. A simple little details on address can go a long way to make things a lot easier.”  

My coworker said nothing, just turned back to his computer and continued his work. But my other coworkers nearby heard what I said, they all had small smiles on their faces, because they like it when they see this guy get trouble for a mistake he makes.

I’ll post some other stories about him in a few days. If anyone wants to hear more, let me know, and I’ll let you know when I post more on this guy. 
And sorry if things seem jumbled. I used voice dictation for most of this.",0,1628797478

727,We Are Out of Ice.,"I work as a cashier in a large chain grocery store. We also sell ice, located in a large freezer near the front of the store next to the registers.


It was slowing down in the store and I had some return items at my till that needed to go back. We can either bring the items to customer service and they will return them to shelf, or we can go return them directly. The item I had was located in a nearby aisle so I decided to return it directly. Our large ice cooler is located at the end of this aisle, which is next to the registers. As we have been having a heat wave lately, our ice was sold out again today. 


As I turn up the aisle and pass the ice cooler, I hear a woman close the cooler door and comment out loud ""Oh, There's no more ice!"" I continue walking, return the item to shelf and as I turn around the woman is standing directly behind me, blocking my way out of the aisle and glaring daggers directly into my eyes. 


Me: cashier, C: customer

C: Did you just IGNORE ME?

Me: Pardon? Did you need help with something?

C: Did you. Ignore. Me?

Me: No, not intentionally? I was retuning an item to the shelf. Sorry you had the impression I was ignoring yo-

C: Theres no more ice in the cooler.

Me: Yes, We are all sold out of ice. 

(silence.... She looks at me with a blank look and does not say anything else for seconds, seemingly unhappy with my answer)

Me: We don't have any more ice. We are sold out. 

C: Well where am I supposed to get my ice from!?

Me: You could try [gas station across the street], they usually have some. 

(more silence, still glaring at me)

C: I came here to buy ice.

Me: We do not have any ice in stock at this time. 

C: (waves her hand at me and turns to leave) Don't be so rude!


I really didn't think I sounded rude, and I was genuinely confused when she came up to me asking if I ignored her. She didnt address me directly at all before she confronted me (No ""Hey,"" or ""Scuse me"" to get my attention). Although I did hear her say ""Oh, Theres no more ice!"" , it sounded more like an observation out loud rather than asking an employee if there was more somewhere else.",0,1628750914
728,Told customer I was a prisoner,I used to work at a big box electronics store selling car stereo equipment. A decision was made only managers could open the door between the store and the install bay. Everyday customers would buy their stuff then have to wait for a manager to come open the door. So everyday I would be asked by every customer qhy don't they trust you to have a key. As a part time (for the discount) employee I usually would just shrug my shoulders. Then one day I was asked the question and for what ever reason I said ma'am I'm hoping to earn that privilege.  I went on to say I was a privileged prisoner from the local prison who was soo  to be released and was earning a place in the store back in my community upon release. The manager came and let her out to get her stuff installed. A few days later I came into work to see the district manager waiting on me. Evidently she sent an email to corporate commending them on the prison work program. Luckily I didn't really get in trouble but they were not impressed with my laughter.,0,1628750161

The nest one is walking up but the lady sets her stuff down on my counter and I say “oh maam you have to wait in the line” and she says “but i only have two items” (i usually dont have a problem with this however my manager was recently getting on us about this and was working near me at one of the registers and im just trying to have a peaceful last day of work). So i tell her im not allowed to and she asks the lady that walked up if its ok if she goes ahead of her and she says yes so I go ahead and ring her up and the whole time she has ab attitude abd i basically ignore it. I tell her the total and she repeats it back and I say yes she gives me the money I put it in and give her change and she starts complaining asking why i gave her coins and I explain to her how much she gave me in comparison to her total and she tries to blame me basically saying well why didnt you say that. So i then have to call a manger to come and open my register and she decided she didnt want to wait cause i was pissing her off.

This happened to me just last week and I can't forget about it, it was a moment of weirdness and dumbness. I work at a popular clothing store with a short name and in that store, just like any store we have set prices and sometimes those clothes go on sale. 

I was working on the register at the time and it was not busy so I was cleaning and hanging up clothes to run when she came along. I set up the register and was ready to ring her up.

Me: Hello, I can ring you up right here!

She walked up and set the jacket on the counter.

Her: So I was wondering about the price of this jacket, do you think you could check it for me?

At my store, we didn't have any price checkers anywhere around the store so this was not a weird request at all.

Me: Of course! Let me check!

It rang up as $20.99, it used to be $50

Me: So this jacket is $20.99!

Her: Oh, well I can only $15 for it. Is that ok?

Me: I'm sorry?

Her: I can only buy this jacket for $15 dollars. It's not like anyone wanted it and it's summer so nobody is gonna buy it.

Me: I'm sorry ma'am, the price here is set and we don't allow haggling. 

Her: Can I have a manager here?

This is when I knew I was in it for the long run, I radioed my manager and he came very quickly.

Manager: Hello ma'am is there a problem?

Her: Yes, your employee won't let me haggle the price down.

Manager: I'm sorry? We don't allow haggling here, if anything she did the right thing.

Her: Well fine, I won't be shopping here anymore. 

Me: Have a good day!

Manager: Radio me if she comes back. Good job.

That was my story for this subreddit, I have more if y'all want it. I know it was short but I had to tell someone about it lol.

737,"M'am ,even though you are from a respectable family ,you still have to pay for your gas","I just want to put a disclaimer that english is not my first language.
So i work at a gas station and one day this old lady comes in and asks my coworker to tank the gas in her car for her because she doesn't know how to.
He helps her and the whole time is very polite with her and she mentiones how for some reason everywhere she goes everybody gets mad at her e.g. Today she didn't want to pay for parking and the parking workers didn't let her leave until she paid for her parking ticket...
Then after they both come inside and she asks me how much she has to pay
And i tell her the price lets say 160€ .
She looks around her wallet a little bit and is like oh i guess i dont have enough money...well i come here all the time i'll bring it next time.
And both me and my coworker look at each other and i ask her how much does she have and she says 120€ .
I tell her politely okay so you go home get the money and get back here in about 1 hour max we don't have to call the police just be here as soon as you can and all good.
She is like offended that i'm asking her to go back home and than come all the way back here and she starts saying how she doesnt wanna drive home and than back here for 40€ (btw her home was about 10 minute drive from the gas station) and im like m'am we work until 2pm if you don't bring money until then we have to pay those 40€ that she didn't have.
At this point she is shocked that im asking her to actually pay for that even though she is our ""regular"" customer .
She also mentioned that she is from a wealthy family and that her brother is a lawyer or something like that and that we should treat her more nicely.
When she said that i was already so fu*king annoyed and shocked at the same time that im having this conversation with a grown woman.
Then she went on about how we were insensitive and cheap for not wanting to pay for those 40€ that she ""didn't have"" and let me just make it clear that this lady had a nice car and you could see that she wasn't poor.
Eventually when we mentioned police another 100€ appeared in her bag and she was able to pay but before leaving she said that i was a horrible person and said something along the lines ""no wonder you work at a gas station""

Him:I'm here for an upgrade, I want this phone right here... Can I just leave my old phone with you to back everything up into my new one? We're in a hurry and going to grab dinner next door.

*Super distracted and not listening to me*

Me: Well I'll need you here to complete the upgrade portion but you can go while it backs up. Also, are you looking to trade in the phone? It's eligible for 700 in credits. 

Him: ugh, ok well I really need you to hurry and cool. 

Me: *in my head* don't come to get an upgrade and not have time to spend on it... I go grab phone and continue with upgrade. 

Him: done yet? *He asks multiple times while super distracted and not listening to me* 

Me: not quite but we're almost there. *I finish and get to the back up part* ok once you log into your account you can leave the phone to go eat. 

*He leaves and goes to eat, comes back for phone and leaves his old phone for the trade in. I have been having issues trading in phones on my account so I have to have a manger do it. Turns out he's on an old plan and to trade it in he needs to be on a new unlimited plan. I call and tell him sorry for the mix up/the information about his old phone.  He says he'll be back because it's unacceptable. He comes in and wants to talk to the manager. I say sure. Manager tells him same thing and he responds with ""I would've never gotten the phone had I known I wasn't getting a trade in"" DUDE you were gonna get the phone anyways!!!

739,Customer gets mad when I don’t let her break the law…again.,"Earlier today, I was working my shift at a convenience store when a woman came inside. After a moment or so, she approached my register, and asked for some cigarettes in a very snotty, annoyed fashion. She swore at me when I mistakenly thought she asked for Marlboros when she really wanted Paul Malls. She also looked as trashy as her attitude; emaciated body that aged 30 years ahead her actual age; crooked brown teeth; and unkempt hair and clothes. I didn’t think she was trashy based on her appearance; her attitude was trashy, and her appearance happened to reflect that.

Anyway, after I rang up her order, I asked for ID, as was standard of our store policy. She bregrudgingly handed me her driver’s license, and when I scanned it, it came back as being expired since 2017! I showed my supervisor, and she politely informed the lady that, by law, we couldn’t sell her any tobacco with an expired ID. My supervisor and I had then the following exchange with her, with the lady customer being snarky and bratty through it all:

Lady: You guys didn’t f**king card me the last time I was here!

Supervisor: Doesn’t matter; it’s still against the law.

Me: This license expired 3 years ago.

Lady: Well, duh; I was in prison for 3 years! I just got out of f**king prison!

Supervisor: Don’t care. 

I had another customer to attend to, so I didn’t hear the rest of the exchange. The lady ended up walking away empty handed. My supervisor said I made the right call carding the lady. Our store would’ve gotten in huge trouble for selling things like tobacco and alcohol illegally. I now card just about anyone buying smokes or booze since. 

You’d think spending 3 years in jail would’ve made somebody learn NOT to break the law! Hope it doesn’t take another 3 years to get it through her head.

TL;DR: Ex-con tries to buy cigarettes with an expired license from +3 years ago. She argued with me and my supervisor for a while, but ended up leaving empty handed.",0,1628643041

743,Dealing with the public is fun.....like bathing in acid.,"So a few tales from when I worked in furniture delivery.    
1. So we got a call to deliver a queen size mattress, foundation and bedroom set. now there are a few personal rules when delivering furniture. Due to my size and height If i can't walk through a door without turning sideways (i am two feet and a half feet across the shoulders) a standard couch isn't going to fit and if I have to duck going up a flight of stairs (I'm 6 feet 6 inches tall) a queen sized foundation isn't going to fit either. We get to the customer's home and the first thing to go wrong is that I have to duck going up to stairs. I knew that the foundation wasn't going up those stairs. We did it our best shot and it just wouldn't go. The customer decided that we were idiots and said, ""I've moved furniture before and I know it will fit."" My coworker and I look at each other with the same thought, The hell you think we do for a living? Not the first thing we said, but the first thing we thought. She tried for several minutes to get it up the stairs herself before admiring we were right and deciding to set the bed up in a room on the first floor.   


2. We offered free delivery for all orders. This man comes in and buys a big couch.  The salesman offers to have it delivered. Customer refuses and says he'll take it home himself. my coworker and I took the couch out to his vehicle expecting he had a truck of some kind, nope, minivan. The couch hung out the back about 6 inches so the back hatch wouldn't close. We had some rope and managed to secure the couch and tie the door down so it wouldn't move too much. Found out later on that he had to have his door fixed because he hit a bump and bent the door enough that it wouldn't latch properly. Thank God for liability waivers. He threatened to sue the store but he had sign an agreement that said we took no responsibility for damages cause because the customer refused delivery and did it themselves (paraphrasing of course because I can't think of the correct phrasing right now). Gotta love it when people destroy their own property and blame it on you. We even told him this wasn't the best idea, but he just said, Nah it'll be fine.

3. The owner one day decided that he was spending too much money on delivery when we made long distance deliveries. His grand money saving idea was to tell us that the drive to the customer's home and back didn't count towards our paid hours and only when we got there and delivered the product would count towards hours and as soon as we got back in the truck the clock stopped. You can imagine how that went with my coworker and I. As soon as he finished explaining the plan, we looked at him and said, good luck finding some one to work like that cause we won't. As I said before I'm a giant and my coworker wasn't much smaller than me. No one was gonna work under those conditions. He insisted and we told him best of luck and  went to lunch and didn't come back for a couple hours to show him he wasn't going to push us around, and that he would never find anyone who was gonna work like that. He called us back and said he changed his mind and wasn't going to follow through with the plan.",0,1628602080
744,"""That's My Mom, Ma'am.""","A little quick story from a couple days ago.

It's about an hour before closing, and my mom was on the register while I was bagging. Yes, we work at the same store. My mom is about to pull her till and count it so she can leave.

When she does this, I start preparing to fill any empty milk, egg, or bread shelves. Mom says the usual ""Okay. I'm counting my drawer down, then I'll be going home. Love you. See you at home.""

A customer on the next register hears this and says something along the lines of ""Those two shouldn't be working together if they live together, and he's still young. He could do so much better than an older woman.""

Her cashier, who I'm friends with, calls me over. She asks the woman to repeat what she just said, and the woman does so.

Me: ""Well, that's just your opinion, and I respect that, but ma'am...that's my mom.""

She looks so embarrassed. She just finishes her transaction and leaves without saying anything else. Haven't seen the woman since.",0,1628601882
745,I didn't know it was my responsibility,"So many people DO NOT use the grocery dividers AND stand real close to the other family, that I often start scanning the next customer's order. In fact, some families are same order, just make sure they are separate as we bag, so there is a small space btwn items, and then I think well that's the next customer.

1. My eyes are mostly on the items as they are being entered (make sure they are getting entered (noise level vs beep) and correct price/item.
2. This means, my eyes are not anywhere near the end of the belt.
3. No one has arms large enough to reach and put the divider btwn shopping orders.

All of this said, and I get a customer who told me I had no idea I was supposed to put the divider up. Really, I get not wanting to reach over the belt (though you want me to reach even further for your water/soda), or thinking you can pay enough attention to keep me from starting to grab your items.

746,How My Day ar Work Went Today,"So I work at little chain hardware store, ""Bowl's"" idk you might've heard of it. I've been working there for about 3 weeks and this has by far been the most eventful day.

An important thing to know before I begin is that we recently got self check out registers and those registers only take card. Becuase of this we have a register open in case somebody wants to pay with cash. The self check out lanes are always open and we have at least 1 person there watching over the registers. The store has recently hired a lot more front end people, so now we have an abundance of front end people. So now we have at least 2 people at the registers, 1 at self check out and the other at a normal register.

Since we've gotten self chec out there have been A LOT of comments around them and many people have offered some sort of variation of ""self check out is stealing jobs.""

I shall present you todays events in order of appearance. And honestly, thank God we're required to wear masks because they have worked wonders in amplifiying my poker face and hiding my wtf faces.

1. A couple around 40-50 came in and were standing behind a guy that looked around 18. They've come in before and have offered their opitions of self check out each time I helped them out. When I was checking out the 18 yr old, his total came out to $X and 4 cents. The guy paid with a 20 and when the couple heard want his change would be ($X and 96 cents), the wife offered him 4 cents so that way he'd only get bills back instead of a bunch of coins. I though that was very sweet of them and though this time would be a bit different.

As I started scanning them the husband began with the usual comments about how our jobs is begin stolen to me and my coworker and self check out and then began recounting their experience in a New Mexico ""Gualmart."" They said that it was a ghost town and the only thing open was the self check out, then his wife came in and said that because the store was located on a reservation the natives took over the store.

The wife then went on to say that people that use self check out are all sheep and her husband finished off with, ""Who do I need to talk to to get rid of these fucking machines?!""

My coworker responded, ""Well sir we conduct an online survey, you can fill it out and share your thoughts there.""

After I handed them their reciept, highlighted, and pointed out where they can find the surevy the husband looks me in the eye and says, ""Cool thank you, you're doing a great job OP, keep it up"" and they left with another quick goodbye to my coworker and I.

TBH they were really nice just...intense

2. An older man around 50 came in and was at the end of a rather long line waiting for my register. In the background the head cashier was conducting an observation of me and my coworker (they do them monthly and it's just to make sure everyone is doing what their supposed to). Then the guy came up I switched with my cowrker so she could be observed. When I left the register the guy said, ""Awe you don't want to check my out?""

'No sir, I'd love to but we have to switch off every so often but I'll be here if you need anything else.""

""Aaahhhhh I should've said that (turns to coworker) you have to be very careful nowadays, you cant saying anothing or a female will get all mad. Like I can't even tell you how beautiful you look."" 

And went on until the transaction was finished, all the while my coworker kept giving him one owrd answers and nodding. Meanwhile the head cashier and I are making a 0_0 at each other.

3. I had to explain to an older couple (around 80ish) how/what card pins, cash back, and debt accounts were.

4. A woman wanting to do a propane excahnge (swap an empty tank for a new one). I rang her up and told to give me about 5-10 min and someone will meet you outside at the propane tanks to help her. She nods and leaves. 

Now our propane tanks are in a huge display directly to the left of our exit door, you can't miss them. I went to go grab the head cashier and told her someone paid for a propane exhange and she told me to come with so I could learn how to do it. So were waiting outside for about 5 minutes, no sign of her. We close up the display and go inside.

After about another 10 minutes the same coworker that was hit on by the weird old guy walked over from our lumber desk (end of the store by loading dock) and said ""So theirs a woman outside lumber, she said she bought propane and has been sitting there waiting for someone to help her. I told her to comback over here.""

The head cashier and I were like wtf. So after ten minutes she came up to the register again. She was like ""I've been waiting outside forever no one came to help me"" and so on and so on. Both the head cahsier and myself said ""We were outside waiting for you but you never came."" And she responded, ""Well I didn't see you, and the propane is NOT outside, now is sombody going toget me my propane???"" 

After a few more words were excahnged, the head cashier led her outside to swap her tank and that was the last we saw of her.

My supervisor has been having me cover breaks and lunches all day, and while I was on lane 23, when I had no customers, I waved over a nice gentleman who had a small cart of about 10-15 items. We talk and it's a very pleasant conversation,  but there's a line forming, so after he grabs his bags (he almost missed his meat, which I've bagged separately), I see him off, and as I'm scanning the lady behind him, I notice he missed a bag containing hot potato wedges. He's almost at the door, so I don't have time to flag him down. I just hold onto his bag in case he comes back. 

Well, I'm told to shut my light off and cover GM self checkout for a 15 minute break and then go on my lunch, so when I get through my line, I scribble a note on some receipt tape and I walk off. 

Probably about 5 minutes into the break I'm covering, the guy who was on 23 asks supervisor where he's to go, and then he sees the potato wedges and starts calling ""Supervisor! Supervisor!"" But the supervisor is too far off, so I ask him if he needs something.

He holds up the bag of potato wedges and asks for the context behind them. I tell him that they were left behind, and then he asks about the note. ""What does this mean? Lol 23? ...Am I missing a joke or something?""

Warning : funeral/death

For context, I work in a small workshop that sells products and customizes customers belongings. We do a lot of different products, and we all have assigned fields. Mine is engraving, which goes from bottles and glasses to granits.

A few years ago, an old gentleman (he had excellent manners) came to us asking questions about a granit plaque for funeral purposes (what we can give him, sizes, prizes, etc). Nothing out of the ordinary.

He asked for a drawing with a text that looked like a poem, all filled with gold leaves, engraved on granit plaque and put on a small pedestal.

We had other orders to fullfill and had to order the granit from another country so it would take us 2 months at least to complete the order. He didn't mind and left with a smile.

He proceeded to come back to see how his order evolved at least once a week. Always polite, good manners and a gentle smile.

The 4th or 5th time he came back, he told us that he was sorry for coming so much, that he was just nervous to pass away before it would be completed. It was really important to him and here's why.

He wanted to place this plaque on a woman's grave. He fell in love with that woman when they were young. She fell in love this someone else, got married and had children. He lived a long and happy life. All this time, our customer had been in love with her, but respected her and supported her as a friend all his life. He never told her again about his feelings, never told anyone about it, and he was never able to stop loving her.

The poem talked about how two dancers met a summer night and shared a magical moment that they shared and will still exist when the night comes back.

Our customer wanted to do one last thing for her before he had to leave as well.

It was hard not to cry after hearing his story, and to this day it is one of the most significant event that happened to me on this job.",0,1628417021
759,“But I’m A Nice Guy!”,"A bit of an ongoing story encasing the last month and a half. 

There’s this one customer I refuse to sell to, full stop no exception. For the past four months he’s usually rude AF when asked to do something that is legit just basic decency and common sense for customers in a store (don’t come behind the counter to grab an employee to get their attention, to grab the store phone, please don’t trash the place, please don’t call our female workers “girlfriend” especially the underage ones it makes them uncomfortable, etc etc) like he will throw attitude and respond with things like “Why?” And “do you want my business or not?” Which I want to say no I don’t but I keep my mouth shut. 

Well about a month ago I decided I had enough when he threw a fit about a price because I was a penny off in the after tax amount I gave him. A total I had to calculate mentally because he refused to pay at the register. Then he changed and said the amount I said (after tax) didn’t match what it listed x-item as on receipt (he referred to the before tax amount) and every time I tried to explain that the amount I gave him was the amount after tax he interrupted me, like I could not get two words in before he complained that it says y-amount on the item. THEN he went off about how I need to learn to do my job right and that I’m a bad employee if I don’t have the prices memorized. Again, I was only a penny off. So I walked away before I said something that would get me in trouble. 

Ever since I’ve refused to sell to him, the other employees are welcome to sell to him if they want. Every time he complains about me not selling to him, that he doesn’t get why I’d do that or why I don’t like him when he’s a nice guy, and that it’s unfair. 

To add; he had no intention to pay for the stuff he complained about. I intercepted him by chance when he was walking away with it, he apparently thought he got free food just for being there.",0,1628389405
760,But we closed half an hour ago,"I was working in a pet supply store, and we also had cats from the RSPCA that we processed adoptions for, and because we liked the cats, we would lock the door at closing time, and just let the cats run around the store while we took our sweet time to cash up and play with the cats, before putting them back in their enclosure and head home (exiting out the front door) maybe half an hour or more after closing.

One hot summers day, we had been experiencing a heat wave for three or so days, when we did just that, and so it was half an hour after closing that we were walking towards the front (glass) door to leave when an older guy comes up to the door, it doesn’t open so he cups his hands around his face and sees us inside the darkened, no lights on store, and he yells “I need to come inside, I need clippers for my dog” 
“But we are closed” I replied 
“But I need clippers for my dog, it’s hot and I need them” 
“Yeah but we are closed, we closed half an hour ago, there are no registers on, so I can’t sell anything, sorry”
It went on for another 5 mins and he was pissed, but he eventually left. 

Seriously dude, you wait until the third day of a heat wave, six hours after the peak temperature, at night, and half an hour after the shops are closed to come out to buy clippers??

762,Why me?,"I volunteer at a small charity shop. There is only one till which is at the far end of quite a long counter (which we use for cleaning/sorting/pricing donations). Now, I was not on the till, but was quite intensely scrubbing this glass bowl (I had pretty much completely zoned out of everything because I had been methodically cleaning donations for the past 2 hours, and no one had any need to approach me for anything, because a) I am clearly busy, and b) my colleague was standing just over a metre away from me at the empty till waiting for the next customer).

The one thing I do respond to, is my name. There I was scrubbing, and my manager calls my name, so I quickly turn around and go ""Yes"", and she just looks at me in surprise, waves her hand at me and goes ""Customer!"" like 'what an idiot', so I turn around and see a woman who's kind of smirking like she agrees with my manager that I'm scatter-brained (it is true). I first think she's going to ask me a question about how much something is, etc. But then she just hands a bunch of items. Bear in mind, with one hand I'm holding a bowl with the other a cleaning cloth, my hands are covered in wiper spray and grime. I awkwardly place the bowl on the table, take the items, all the while staring at her in confusion thinking I must have missed something because what is happening. In the end I just kind of directly pass the items to my colleague at the till who starts scanning them in, and I just go back to cleaning. 

That was 8 hours ago, and I still have not come up with a reason why the customer handed me the items to purchase rather than the person working at the till.",0,1628371114
763,still hate that she did this,"For reference, I live in the UK.

This short little story I have takes place a few years ago, when I was working in a charity shop.

One of the things sold in said shop is shoes, and one day I was carrying out the task of rotating stock, I was doing the shoes when this event occurred. In the grand scheme of things, it's not a big deal, but I still think about it every so often.

So anyways, I was in the process of rotating the shoe stock when a customer came over and started talking to me, no big deal, right? Well, I was used to conversing with customers by this point, but what this customer did still irritates me to this day. She started pinching my cheeks.

I was about 18, so you can imagine how I felt about her doing that. At this point, my parents and I had only been living in our new house for a little while, and whilst I by no means know every single person on our street, I am now quite familiar with this woman, but at the time I didn't really know who she was. Maybe it was because my brain was in work mode, I'm not sure.

Yes, the woman who came in and pinched my cheeks - on the shop floor, whilst I was working, is my neighbour.

This came to light a few days later, when she stopped by our house and said it was her who had visited the shop. Whilst I just replied with a simple, ""Oh, yeah,"" as if I suddenly remembered, that was not at all the response I wanted to give.

Me: Ok, it’s just that we close at 11.
Lady: Well your sign was on??
Me: Yes, because we were open when you walked in, now we are about to close. 
Her: I’m looking for a wine my daughter had with an obscure label.
Me: (uh that could be anything) Ok, can you be more specific? Do you know what style it was? What country?
Her: No (maybe a guess at a colour of label)
Me: Ok, I’m sorry I don’t know what that could be. If you know of anything you’d like, I can still check you out before we close.
Her: (in an annoyed tone) Well never mind then, I just assumed you were open because you had the sign on.

765,"Little kid, big kleptomaniac","Last summer, I had my first thief encounter. I worked in a small bookstore that also sells a variety of other items, including stationary. We also had a small toy aisle.
At the time of this story we knew there had been some theft, as my boss had found an empty package on a shelf with the toy ripped from it.

I was behind the register when i spotted a kid (around 10 y/o maybe?) in a puffy jacket. I’d seen him acting shifty before, so I kept an eye on him. And yup, I watched him grab an expensive toy from the back of the store before heading down to the register where he asked me to return it. He claimed a friend had bought it for his birthday, but didn’t have a receipt.
One of the store owners was working in the back, so I got him involved. The owner asked the kid a couple of questions, including when his birthday was. He then pulled up the item’s sales record to reveal we hadn’t sold any of this particular toy since well before the proposed birthday. The owner grilled the kid for a bit longer, but he nervously dodged all questions before fleeing (leaving the toy behind).
I had my lunch break right after this, and spotter the kid again while walking out the mall, at the nearby grocery store’s gift wrapping station, wrapping something that looked suspiciously like one of our fancy kiddie notebooks. 

A few days later two young women came to the store with two plastic bags, filled to the brim with items from our toy and stationary aisles. They told us their little brother had bought all of the items without their parent’s permission and asked to return it.
We immediately knew the brother had to be the thieving kid (this was a small store, so we would’ve known about any kid actually purchasing all of these items).
The owners got involved and broke the news to the sisters. They were shocked, but apologetic, and payed for the merchandise.

The next day, one of the sisters returned with their father, and EVEN MORE merchandise the kid had stolen (including a big inflatable pool!). They explained that they’d confronted him (locking him in the bathroom until he confessed), and he had even been stealing money from the family.
The father thanked us for letting the family handle things before getting the cops involved. He said that if the kid had been caught stealing in their country of origin (they were Afghan refugees), the local shopkeepers probably wouldn’t have been so forgiving. The kid got off with a store ban, and i haven’t seen him since.

We were all pretty shocked by the sheer amount of stuff he’d stolen! I felt bad for his family, who seemed like they already had a lot on their plate. Here’s to hoping the kid has learned his lesson and left his thieving days behind him!",0,1628334867

770,Abusive customer,"There has been an elderly woman shopping at the grocery store where I work since at least before the pandemic. But I dont remember her much before 2019. She only shops in the afternoons and evenings. Sometimes she shows up more than once a day. Anyway, she is aggressive and verbally abusive to customers and staff. I don't usually deal with her as she doesn't shop my department (clothes), but I do hear her yelling at my cashier and customer service peeps. I don't know why no one has grown enough balls to deal with her once and for all.... I guess they think because she's elderly she deserves a pass on her terrible behaviour? I don't know. Last week, she tried to hit a customer. This week she started stalking one of our staff members around the store, and she actually attacked her when she was on cash yesterday. The woman went behind the cash, behind the plexiglas, grabbed the cashiers mask off and started pushing her. I don't know why the staff last night didn't do anything immediately, but today, when this woman arrived at the store she was told she is no longer allowed on the property, and is permanently banned from the store. FINALLY! If it had been me, I might be looking at charges myself, because NO ONE is putting their hands on me. EVER. So fuck you lady. Don't ever come back.",0,1628286703

basically, our store gives out little punch-out coupons where, for every $10 you spend in store, you fill up tiers of the coupon. $50 gets you 2% off of chemicals for the season. $100 gets you 4% off for the season. $200 is the entire card and it saves you 10%

this man comes in with the card filled out to get 2% off. he asks for an $8 container of chlorine, gives me his card, i ring him up, hand him the receipt, and then he shows me his coupon. 

“so wait i just lost MONEY because you didn’t ask for my coupon? are you serious?”

he then proceeds to pester us to refund the transaction, restart, and go again so he can save his 2%. which we do.

Obviously an older parent forced this and the worst part is I can't answer the question. Why? Because that same parent will ask who told them that and when they find out it was just a random worker they will drag the poor kid back into the store causing a scene.

777,"One of Those Rare, Wholesome Moments in Retail","\*This happened in November of 2020, still sticks with me.\*

I am working on a new display table arrangement at my soulless beauty store gig when you come in.

You're wearing a surgical mask, but I can see your eyes are pleasant. They crinkle at the sides as you smile at me in greeting. I ask you what I can help you with today. ""I'm looking for a perfume, but I'm not sure exactly which one,"" You say. I'm happy to help; it's always a wholesome experience to help out a guy who isn't sure what his partner's favourite perfume is, but is determined to gift her with it. 

You are completely out of your element. What's a body mist? An eau de toilette? A parfum? I busy myself pulling out tester bottles and cotton pads as I explain, ""It's usually the strength of the fragrance and how long it lasts on the skin, due to the alcohol content, that determines the type of fragrance."" I spray a body mist onto a cotton pad, and pass it to him to assess. ""Don't worry, we're okay with you taking down your mask to smell it."" You tuck your mask under your chin. You're quiet throughout my babbling, so I ask you, ""Is this a Christmas gift for someone special?""

I have said the wrong thing. You lower the cotton pad; this isn't the right perfume. I see the grief on your face now that your mask is lowered. ""No. My wife passed recently. I thought it might be nice to have a bottle of her perfume. This was her favourite store.""

I understand now, that I'm not just a salesperson helping someone find a gift. I have been tasked with helping you find something of your deceased wife left on this Earth. 

You know it has a certain flower in it, but we've got a lot of perfumes with that same flower extract. So I keep pulling out more bottles, spraying one cotton pad after another and passing them off to you. We find it. We find your wife's perfume. 

The look on your face is one of recognition, peace and grief, all mixed together. ""That's the one."" I understand that this is no mere olfactory experience. You are smelling what you smelled when your wife was alive, vibrant and well. You are transported back to a time when life was simpler and happier. You reaffix your mask to your face. I'm so glad we found the perfume. I wish I had more to offer you.

I ring up your purchase at the till, and I sorely wish I had something wise to say. Something that brings meaning to what is and has always been tragic and senseless: grief. I don't, so instead I say something dumb. I say, ""They say the sense of smell is the most strongly linked to memory."" You nod, and I see your eyes crinkle with a smile again. ""I think you are quite right about that,"" you say. You pay, I wish you well, and you depart.

When I clock out and go home, I get in a hot shower. I pop the cap on my husband's favourite shower gel; the one with mint and bergamot in it. I breathe the smell of it in deeply. I think of the smell of his Old Spice deodorant. The smell of his work clothes after a long day. The smell of his hair after it's just been shampooed. I wonder what it will be like when smells and memories are all I have left. 

We will all lose someone we love. It is all we can do to love them while they're still here. Thank you for coming to my store today, and giving me the privilege of reconnecting you with your wife, if only in some small way. My heart is softer for having met you.",0,1628269905

782,"A lost wallet, no beer, and a jail bed for the night","This happened a couple weeks ago.  A customer (we'll call him Jim), who has been frequenting my for the past few weeks prior to this incident, walked in rather agitated and upset.  I could tell, because the first word out of his mouth while in the entrance was a loud ""F@#k"".  I was at the register and he came right on over.  He had lost his wallet and figured it might be in our store.  I'll add here that the wallet wasn't actually that important, as he had cash on him, but it will have relevance later.  I informed him that we hadn't seen no wallets and checked our lost in found (which we keep locked in our safe; my manager checked when I paged him).  Then he made his intention clear: he would go grab some beer and I could ring him up because ""I knew he was overage"".  Our corporate policy requires we ID everyone for alcohol and tobacco products; which I explained to him.  I explained this so much I sounded like a broken record.  The longer our conversation lasted the more agitated he became.  I'll add here that every time I had seen him he had been polite, but was a very weird dude.  Jim then became silent midway through our chat and made hand motions to, what looked like to me, putting on a seatbelt (that's when I knew he wasn't desperate, but something was very off about him).  He was trying to calm himself down it appeared, and somehow hoped it would erase the previous conversation.  Next thing he said was if I could sell him the beer, and a repeat of what I had already told him.  

Very soon my manager was involved and told him the very same thing.  By this point he was fed up and telling me sob stories about how hard it was to g.et there on foot, how he knew my manager from high school (they didn't know each other from Adam), throwing insults mostly at my manager and cussing loudly.  These were said in a very hostile manner, as if he could snap any time.  On his way out the door he started to berate a female customer, asking what she was laughing at.  The two customers waiting to come to the register were standing way back, and this young lady was not laughing.  Jim then asked her to buy him beer, then extended the invitation out to everyone.  A mom in a nearby aisle had heard enough and decided to tell him so as he was leaving.  I waved her down because the last thing we wanted was another confrontation.  Fortunately he didn't even react and left.  

Once he's left we tried to get everything back to normal by ringing up the customers who had been waiting on Jim.  He wasn't gone more than a minute or two, before he came barging back in with a vengeance; hitting our metal detector along the way and said something that I couldn't distinguish.  His next words we could, something about ""you have my wallet"" and ""take me to your lost and found,"" with explosives mixed in.  He came right up to the counter and accused us of keeping his wallet and demanded we take him to our lost and found (because he needs his beer, remember).  It was at this point my adrenaline dumped.  My heart began racing and I thought the whole time I may actually find myself in an actual fight.  I was just standing there (I hadn't moved, unlike my customers who got the hell away from where we were), waiting to see what he was going to do.  I wholeheartedly felt, he was on the verge of violent action.  Right then, a cop walked in.  His demeanor changed instantly, and on the spot he made up a lie about how we had stolen his wallet or something like that.  He even persisted in asking the officer to look in the lost and found with him.  Within a minute this officer and his partner had him cuffed and led out; all right in front of my register.  It became clear when he was being cuffed that he was intoxicated (the officer said he could smell it).  I explained to the officers all that had occurred and filled out a written statement.  

We found out afterward, that another female customer had gone to the back of the store when he started going off the first time, prior to his second entrance, and called the cops.  Had she not done that, we'd have been attempting to call when he walked back in the second time (my manager had the phone in his hand and was about to while he was accusing us of stealing his wallet) and things may have likely gotten physical.  I found out later that another store manager knew the guy and informed me he was a drug addict.  It confirmed my suspicions that, a drunk would not be so amped and belligerent, but someone coming off a high might be.  All in all, a very interesting life experience I never thought I'd encounter.",0,1628222390

785,Sorry for attempting to make something more convenient and cheaper for you?,"Happened today and I’m honestly still just confused more than anything.


I work in wireless.


A customer comes in talking about a free tablet promotion we are running and says that she spoke with a care rep on the phone and they told her to just go to a store. Okay, no problem and thanks for the sale and commission. Was it that easy? Of course not. The customer doesn’t have my company as her wireless provider and was just looking for the tablet to be free. I explain that having a tablet with unlimited data on an account without a voice line makes the tablet line unnecessarily expensive and ask who her wireless provider is for her voice line. She tells me, then says she likes it because it’s only $30/month. Okay, yea, that’s nice and cheap. I explain that the tablet line by itself would be $70/month, but if she brought over her voice line and put it on the same account as her tablet line with us, combined, the account would be as low as $90/month for both, saving the customer $10/month and making it so she only has to pay 1 bill for both instead of 2.


Convenient and saves money so I though the customer would be at least receptive of the idea. I was very wrong.


At this point she begins verbally berating me. Yelling at me and telling me that I’m being rude trying to sell her something she didn’t come in for letting me know if I continue speaking to her that way she would file a formal complaint against me… ummm. Okay. Before I could speak again, she cut me off and said she also didn’t appreciate how I was conducting myself and motioning around with my hands (I tend to be a bit animated when I talk about anything, it’s just the way I am)


It honestly took every ounce of willpower I had not to snap back at her with “I’m sorry my inadvertent muscle ticks make you uncomfortable” (I don’t have an actual tick, but she was being a real a-hole) but being the good little retail employee I am, I just excused myself from the interaction and had my co-worker finish the interaction.


Did we close the sale? Of course not because she felt we were attempting to swindle her and have her do something she didn’t want to do as if I was twisting her arm to bring over her voice line. I merely suggested it as a way to both save her money and make her billing be more convenient… I’m sorry for that I guess? People are wild.",0,1628214437

I just finished assisting a female customer who was remodeling a walk in closet into a bathroom. She had a sloppily written list of things from her contractor to find. She had her son driving her, (thank God!). She smelled so awfully of alcohol on this fine Thursday morning. She kept double backing on things and not remembering that we'd already gotten what she needed. She kept asking for the clearance areas over and over even though we'd visited the areas with clearance several times. 

I hope she's ok and all turns out right because she was so adamant about being my friend and hanging out with me and kept telling me she loved me. I'm from the south but live in the north, and I'm not too used to day drinkers so I really hope I did ok and was as polite and kind as I'd been trying to be. Her son just bamfed and left me with his mom. Thanks dude... 

I doubt they got everything they needed but no one can say I didn't try. I even used my highlighter to cross things off her list for her and double and triple checked. She kept telling me she wanted to tip me and I kept telling her that I am already paid to do this work and I don't mind helping guide her throughout my store. This is all disjointed but I just needed to get this out to help me process and reflect. She was never rude, mean, or unkind. She was just really drunk and confused.

792,It’s my fault you walked out with something you didn’t pay for,"For context, I work at a general store in a residential area. In this store, our counters are pretty big, meaning if something is placed right in front of it on the floor, I can’t see it, so customers will lift large items up for me to scan. 

One night we’re nearing close and a couple ends up at my register with a bunch of food and I make my way from where I was cleaning to help them. They told me before I rung them up that they had a budget so I kept an eye on the total. They pay and I immediately turn my attention to the next customer in line as she’s putting her stuff on the counter.

While i’m checking out this customer, I notice couple from before is outside with a cooler i didn’t know they had, they’re already out the door and I thought maybe they’d brought it in, but I still had my doubts. I finish up with this customer and go back to nightly cleaning.

Well, woman with the cooler comes back in to buy a pack of cigarettes. I take this opportunity to nervously asked her if they had gotten that cooler from here, and I get a slightly rude “Yes?” I politely explain that I didn’t know they had a cooler and asked if she could bring it back in so I could scan it. Now she’s getting increasingly mad, explaining they loaded it up with the ice and food they just bought and that they were walking home. I ask if she can bring the tag for me to scan and she huffs and walks out the door calling “daddy” loudly to her partner. 

Turns out they don’t have the money for the cooler, so I call the lead key holder on duty to help me. The lady says she’ll return some of the food and pay for the cooler that way, but we explain our refunds don’t go through immediately and she would still not have enough. 

She ended up getting super upset at me, saying it’s my fault because I let her walk out with the cooler. I’m getting lectured by a grown woman on how I should have scanned the cooler first because they had a budget, how I allowed them to walk out so “technically” she shouldn’t have to pay for it, plus plenty of other rude comments. She half yelled “I’m a good person so I will pay for it, but I shouldn’t have to” I cried in the break room while the key holder dealt with the issue. 

My key holder ended up calling the store manager and the woman came in the next day to pay for it. 

Final thoughts: I understand her frustration, and also understand being on a budget. However I don’t understand how blaming and berating me for not ringing up an item I didn’t know they had is going to fix the problem. Everyday I have customers ask if I scanned their large item and most of the time the answer is yes, and if it’s no, they hold it up for me to scan. I’m a teenager and this is my first job, so i’m still learning. I took this pretty personally and wanted to share this and hear other people’s thoughts.",0,1628132496
793,Canada doesn't have a veteran discount,"As far as I know, no store in Canada gives any kind of military discount, veteran or otherwise (correct me if I'm wrong, fellow Canadians). We are not as military oriented as the US. 

Back when I worked at a big red drug store, I worked as a cash supervisor. It was my job to cover my cashier's breaks and make sure customers got as good a customer experience as possible. For those who don't know, drug stores do not sell tobacco or alcohol products so the only item we sell that requires an ID is lottery (relevant later). We also have a senior's day on Thursday where anyone 65+ can get 20% off. We don't need an ID or proof of age, they usually just know to ask for it since signs are up everywhere advertising the discount.

This story takes place about mid 2019, before all the COVID drama started. It was a Saturday so no managers were in.

I was covering my cashier's break when a man comes up with a basket full of stuff. I make the usual greetings, ask if he has our rewards card, and ask if he would like a bag. He gruffly says something about visiting from the US so of course he doesn't have a rewards card with us. He doesn't respond to wanting a bag so I just start stacking his items at the end of the till. 

When I finish scanning his items, I read off his total and ask if he is paying with cash or card. He tosses an ID on the counter. 

Me: Oh, did you want lottery?

Him: What? No. I want a discount. 

Me thinking he meant the senior's discount: Oh I'm sorry we only have senior's discounts on Thursdays.

The customer looks at me like I'm stupid. He shoves the ID closer. Him: I'm a veteran, missy. That means I get a discount no matter what day it is.

Me: Um... I'm sorry but we don't do veterans discounts here in Canada.

Him: Well they do where I'm from so you need to honor that.

I stand there dumbfounded. How did that make any sense? Me: I'm sorry but I have no way to put any kind of discount on your purchase, as it is not Thursday for senior's day, and we have no promo going on right now. 

Him getting obviously upset and red in the face: I want your supervisor. I want you fired. I want a new cashier.

I blink at him. I can barely get the words out as I tell him I AM the supervisor and there was no store manager in today. 

The man flipped his lid. He started yelling at me, telling me I was discriminating and I must hate the US and he hoped they bombed my country next and that all of Canada was a stupid place with stupid people. I just stood there not sure what to do. People were starting to stare and I was so freaked out all i could do was stand there with my mouth open going ""Uhhh...""

Finally he said his piece and stomped out of the store with his ID and nothing else. I stood there in silence for a few minutes just trying to process what happened. My cashier came back but i had nothing else to do so I just stayed on till to help with customers.

A little elderly woman came up to my register to ask if I was alright and that she never liked those ""hooligans south of the border"". She made me smile and actually helped me put some of the items away that the man had left on the till. 

It makes me wonder though, does every place in the US give a discount to veterans? And why did he flip out so badly when I didn't give him one here?",0,1628129753

795,There's no point in shopping here!!!!!,"I work at an office supplies store, and once a year we have a very generous discount for teachers buying school supplies. Basically you get 20% off for a good half of the fall semester. We make up for it in sales because it gets them in the door and they tend to buy a lot. 

In previous years it was always a little awkward because we'd ask for some form of ID or credentials to prove the customer was a teacher; sometimes they genuinely forgot to bring it, and other times we'd get grifters trying to take advantage of the discount. ""Can't you take my word for it?"" and such. 

This year we changed it to where you just download an app, find your school, sign up, and you automatically get the discount at checkout for the whole promotional period. 

Everyone else has been fine with this, except one lady (L). She comes up to my (D) register with easily $200 of merchandise. Since this is during the back to school sale period, it's a *substantial* amount of stuff. Like, a full shopping cart of notebooks, pencils, school supplies, etc. 

L: I want the teacher's discount. 

D: Alright. \*proceeds to hand her the flyer about the new app\* Are you signed up on here? 

L: What do you mean? I just want the discount! 

D: Right; we changed the way that works this year. You put your credentials into the app and it attaches to your account with us. It's actually more convenient because you don't have to bring your ID or anything each time. 

L: But I don't want to download an app! 

D: Yeah, I hear ya. Unfortunately the only way to get the discount is to sign up on the app. But-

L: WELL, THEN THERE'S NO POINT IN SHOPPING HERE!!!!! 

Lady proceeds to storm out of the store without her stuff. I was just about to explain to her that she could quickly download the app, sign up and delete it. She didn't need to keep it. I think there was even a loophole where you download the app and just sign up on the website, so I was gonna look into that for her. 

Took an extra thirty minutes to put all of her stuff back.

One day, a lady comes in with a cart with a big bundle of plastic bags and dumps it on the service counter, stating she needed a refund!

My grandma opens the bag, and lo, inside is an entire turkey in a tin roasting pan, stuffed with stuffing, and clearly partially cooked.

Shocked, grandma told her there's no way to return a turkey in this state.

Grandma told her the most obvious thing ever, ""You have to put it back in the oven for longer!""

Well, it apparantly took several more minutes of refusing the return before the customer took her turkey back and left.

The question that still remains: did the woman ever learn how cooking works? Or did she toss the turkey and try again with a ""better""one?",0,1628109025
798,That's not how a skimmer works...,"Last week I finally quit my gas station job with the national grocery chain that keeps prices low low low low low low low. (I hated typing that as much as you hated reading it.) I had big time moron customers every 5 freaking minutes and could spend hours talking about how no the loyalty card button is on the SCREEN no not the button on the pinpad, the SCREEN. TOUCH SCREEN. No you're still hitting the exact same button I swear to god YOU DROVE A CAR HERE. but this one's about an incident from pandemic round one.  


I was working the closing shift alone, and this was probably around 8-9 pm. A teenage girl tries paying at the pump but her card declines, so she comes up to my window. She says that the pump charged her $150 but won't let her get any gas. I explain that this is a temporary hold and it should drop off soon. For those who don't know: the pump has no idea how much money you have, so when you first insert your card it'll put a hold of somewhere around $130-150 on it just to make sure you'll definitely have enough to get whatever you need. As soon as you're done pumping your gas it'll drop off and only charge you what you actually needed to pay. Every gas station does this; you just usually don't notice it.  


I explain this to the girl, who says that this is the only card she has and now she can't use it anywhere until it falls off. I tell her that it will fall off soon, but if there's any further problems she'll need to call her bank. She seems disappointed, but politely thanks me and leaves for the night.  


About 20 minutes later I get a call from ""Amanda"" at the service desk. She says a woman just called and screamed at her because our gas station skimmed her daughter's card and took her money. I explain to Amanda that that's not how skimmers work. They wouldn't be very useful if they immediately alerted you to their use like that and charged your card for something the thief wasn't even present to steal. She says she knows and tried to explain that, but the woman continued to lose the last of her remaining brain cells and scream about us stealing her money and how she was gonna post on social media about it. I'm like ""lol okay let her be stupid online then"" and we hang up. A few minutes later another service desk employee comes out to check for skimmers just to say she did, and to everybody's surprise I'm sure...we found nothing.  


I spent the rest of that shift hoping and praying she'd come by to yell at me so I could personally tell her she was booboo the fool, but alas. Disappointment once again. I did hear she posted about it somewhere but was never able to find that either. Disappointment *twice*.  


Anyway stay tuned for more gas station posts probably at some point ~~maybe~~.",0,1628098936

802,"No, I did not use telekinesis to ring you up.","I work at a grocery store renowned for its weird flavors and friendly staff--you know the one--anyway the relevant detail is, we do not have conveyer belts at the checkout. You park the cart right next to the register and the cashier takes everything out by hand. There's no scan gun either, I have to pick everything up.

This lady parks her cart and tells me she wants half her stuff separate, for a friend. Okay sure, I scan, bag, and tell her the total.

 There's still the rest of her items in the cart. She pulls the cart away from me to go use the card reader (on the opposite side of my counter where I can't reach them), with all of her unpaid items in it. I think this is super weird, but maybe she has mobility issues and needs the cart for stability? 

Then she tries to leave without paying for half her stuff. ""Ma'am, I haven't scanned the rest of your items--you said you wanted them separate?""

805,Lady wants us to call cops cause someone was kind enough to pay for her order," 

Lady, did not want her stuff paid for. This is mostly from secondhand and a bit from trying to deal with her. 

First of all she ran her card, but messed up (as I've explained US  debit is a trick question. Only pick Visa or MasterCard debit.). She  rerang it and it kept declining. Gentleman behind her told the cashier that he'd pay for it. NOTE: It was the customer not cashier that got the Lady's stuff paid for. At some point manager had to intervene and get the lady to leave the line as she was holding up everyone else.

Lady does not leave the store and just stands near the front. Manager comes  over to me to tell me her stuff is paid for and she's crazy and won't leave. After I get through my line (having to turn off my light in order to do so as it's busy enough. I head over to her. She first tells me,  ""I have no intercourse with you"" \[In my head, I'm glad I know that that probably just means no issue with you, but still, the implications\] She then brings up some random to me people's names saying from another location she remembers me. \[huh?  WTF?\] Then she tells me that the cashier got the customer to pay for her and she didn't want that. She wants the police called.

I am not about to call the police on a good deed. Nor that the store did  nothing wrong. I go over to the cashier to make sure all is on the up and up and yeah. So, then I get on the walkie to the same manager and tell her this lady wants the police involved and it appears as if she is willing to stay here forever. Thus, we need to figure out some way of resolving this. My manager refuses to deal with it. Though, I guess ignoring her was the right call, as Lady did leave on her own as I went back to what I was doing.

Roughly  an hour later Lady comes back. I begrudgingly talk to her. Now she still wants the police called. She also wants us to pull up a report to make  sure her groceries were paid for. I told her we can't pull up a report.  \[Technically, we could, but we'd have to one wait until the next morning  when the lady who works with the tills is in and two we'd have to work hard to figure out which order was her's and three we let her leave her stuff is paid for move on already.\] I was well overdue for my break.

813,Guy tries to return underwear and doesn't understand why its unhygienic,"I was fortunate to not have to deal with this customer personally but was there in observation and was told all about it.

Returns policy context: we don't offer returns on makeup and cosmetics and most certainly we don't offer returns or exchanges/swaps on underwear. 

The reason why we don't accept underwear returns is because its unhygienic and even if its been packaged back up and or washed, we can't just trust the customer's word on that it hasn't been worn/that its clean. 

I suppose the only circumstance we would allow a return is if we literally just served the customer. 

Onto the story; the customer was a middle aged guy with his two kids and he goes up to my friend's till and tries to return his briefs and a t-shirt.  Naturally my friend explains the return policy to which he flips his switch and argues back saying ""HOW IS IT UNHYGIENIC TO RETURN UNDERWEAR?!"" 

Naturally of course my friend and even my supervisor had got involved at this point to explain to the man that it was unhygienic and why it was.

He went on to say ""HOW'S IT HYGIENIC TO RETURN A T-SHIRT AND NOT UNDERWEAR?"". 

I mean I'm kinda at a loss for words here..... like seriously?

Even his kids got involved telling him to shutup (lol) and they even mentioned that he does this a lot so I'm sure other retail staff have had the absolute pleasure to deal with this customer before.

Hygienically speaking, I'm sure no matter how many times you wash the underwear,  the bacteria and sweat and god knows what else will still be there in some form.

814,Had to threaten to call police on customer who verbally attacked me over free food,"So I'll try to shorten this as much as I can. I worked in a small food store, so small that we frequently worked shifts alone in the store. The company who owned this store had a super annoying habit of doing coupons with tons of fine print and rules. Basically get people in with the coupon then upsell the hell out of them or get them away from the coupon to something else (because someone who comes in for a $40 deal of multiple items will definitely change their mind to pay full price for one box of potatoes 🙄). We also had to have a high ticket average and high gm, so failing to meet these rules with customers would result in bad numbers and ultimately warnings, write ups, etc. 

Anyway, this day a couple came in. She had a stack of various coupons. The husband left to do shopping elsewhere and I helped the wife. Of course she wanted the deal from one coupon with the free gift included PLUS the free gift from another coupon without getting anything from that coupon. Basically she met the $50 threshold and thought she'd get the free gifts from all the coupons versus meeting the requirements from each. I explained this. She begrudgingly accepted this, though would continue to fight with me every time she picked a new item expecting the free gifts that wouldn't apply. Finally I worked it out to something acceptable for her while also following the guidelines. 

While checking out her husband came back in. He asks about the free burgers or whatever it was and she got snotty and said ""I don't qualify"" or something to that nature. He then looks to me and says ""You can't just give us some free stuff for spending so much money?"" (Just fyi, $50 was not a lot of money here. One box of potatoes were $25 regular price and our ticket avg was expected to be no less than $80). People loved to expect free things for spending soooo much money with us. I told him I explained the rules already with his wife but that we must follow the coupon rules. He didn't like this answer. He started getting belligerent. ""It's just free burgers. We spent so much. You're going to give us this free stuff."" He actually came around the counter to the side and got into my face. For reference here, I am a 5'3 petite female in a store by myself with a man screaming in my face. I told him I'd call the police if he didn't leave right now. Luckily I had finished ringing them up and the wife told him to go and they left. He was chuckling the whole time leaving, knowing he scared the crap out of me. He then stood outside the window for a second and laughed more and bucked at me.

818,Homeboy doesn't like my customer service,"Greetings, this saga comes to you from Graveyard shift at the gas station, O'dark thirty.

Up to the window walks a very large young man whom I'm seeing for the third time in two weeks.       The first time; he asked for cigarilllos and as per usual, I responded by asking to see his ID.      He seemed like a nice kid and was big enough that he could have been of age, so don't tell anybody, but I gave him the benefit of the doubt and sold him the cigarilllos.      However, I did warn him to bring his ID next time and he nodded in acknowledgement.

Second time, a few days later, a different young, tough man gets out of the passenger side of a car and also asks for cigarilllos.       Once again, I request his ID- this guy doesn't have a spiel so retreats back to the car, whereupon his homeboy, the first large young man I spoke to days ago, steps out.
Homeboy approaches my window with a friendly smile and asks for cigarilllos too.       Same request: ID please.        Strangely enough, he says he forgot it- but can I just give him a chance?      Reminding him, that I gave him a chance last time (...which I'm regreting because now he's even bringing friends to take advantage of my kindness) as well as I *told him* he'd have to bring his ID next time; I refuse the sale.      Homeboy resorts to whining that 'you did before' and 'I come here *allll* the time' etc. etc.       The same old song &amp; dance, and no, off he goes

Tonight:

Tonight, Homeboy arrives grinning, asking for chips, candy and, you guessed it; cigarilllos.   

No ID.

Asking if he'd just like the chips and candy, just makes him angry at *my* terrible customer service.      Well, how dare he!      If Homeboy doesn't like my service; then he doesn't have to have it and so sale denied- dissmissed!
However, unbelievably, he continued the facade; he actually tried the man-boy pout of demanding 'Why!?' over and over, while ignoring my logical answer that it was the law.

819,"""are you open?"" we're clearly not","This happened to me about a week ago.

A bit of context for the store I work at: when we are closed, there are metal shutters that cover all the doors and windows. To get into the building to open in the mornings, we open the shutters for the exit door, which has no handle on the outside, which is fine, since it's an exit door. We open at 9am.

This fateful day I'm on the opening shift, so I'm hanging out with my manager in the office before we open the shutters, when at 8:57am (I remember that specifically) we hear the buzzer that goes off whenever someone opens either the entrance or the exit door. My manager and I look at each other, because neither of us are expecting anyone else to be there yet. 

Then a man comes into the store.

Now remember, every other shutter is closed, and the exit door has no handle on the outside, meaning he literally had to pry his way into the store.

As he walks in he shouts ""hello?"" I step out of the office, look at him, and say ""hi?"" He then asks ""are you guys open yet?"" It took me a moment to be able to respond, wondering how he could possibly think we're open, but then tell him not for a few more minutes. He says okay and walks back out.

He came back in (through the entrance door this time) as soon as we were open and bought his stuff. When he left he forgot his phone on the counter, so he came back a few minutes later, and came in through the exit door AGAIN, despite having already gone through the entrance door once already.",0,1627977949

I pulled out a copy of my stores flyer I kept in my back pocket, put it next to her cut out and said “No, it’s from the competitor. Our flyer as you can see has a glossy coating. Your cut out doesn’t. Also, these aren’t our product numbers, and the brand of the heater doesn’t belong to us. You can also see how are product numbers are different compared to theirs.”

830,Paying with gift cards that won’t expire &gt; one time 20% off entire purchase,"So I work at this popular clothing store at my local mall, and today there was one interesting transaction I came across, and for clarity this originally wasn’t a transaction I was dealing with, but towards the end I had to step in.

It was closing so all of the last customers in the store were making their purchases. One of my coworkers was ringing up these three ladies who were together, and he was able to open a store credit card for one of them, which is always great for us. Where I work, if you apply for the credit card and get approved you get 20% off your entire purchase one time, but you have to use the credit card you just opened (you get a temporary shopping pass before the card arrives in the mail), and if you don’t get approved you get 10% off for trying. 

Here’s where it got complicated: these ladies specifically came in to use these gift cards they had, and despite getting approved for the store credit card which granted them 20% off their entire purchase, they were deadest on paying with the gift cards rather than using their temporary shopping pass and getting 20% off. 

One of my managers was at the register counting cash and closing registers, and she had to step in and explain that the 20% off is a one time thing that will go on the store credit card and how gift cards don’t expire, and can be used online. They still didn’t want to use the temporary shopping pass as they initially came to the store to use the gift cards. There was some back and forth between my manager and the ladies, so my manager had me and other associates step away from the registers for some time.

My manager got fed up and let them use their gift cards rather than take advantage of the one time 20% off. She dumped the contents of their shopping bags on the counter and had me ring up all their items again because the transaction had to be redone. After ringing up everything their gift cards weren’t scanning, so I had to put BOTH of them in manually. Both had $50 in them so they just paid the difference. They thanked me for my patience and left.

Later I mentioned to my manager that I noticed she was frustrated with them, and she stated that she was in fact frustrated as they were doing too much, especially during closing (literally what she said). Personally, I agree with my manager on this as they could’ve use the gift cards ANYTIME, and they passed up on a one time offer of 20% off an entire purchase just to get their gift cards (that will never expire) out the way.",0,1627870453

So I was ringing up a customer and they bought some clothes that totaled to about $40 and paid in cash with changed owed. 

I accidentally hit cash right away instead of typing in the number first (stupid mistake, I know) and so it said “issue $0.00 change” which obviously wasn’t correct. 

I stupidly just closed the cash drawer and decided to just do the transaction again even though that one already went through and the receipt printed out. So I did the transaction the correct way the second time.

The problem is, that first transaction still went through but I closed the cash drawer and didn’t put any money in it. Does that make sense?

So that means now that register will be about $40 short. I’m freaking out now that I’m gonna get in trouble and get fired or that it’ll look like I stole $40 (they have cameras though so if worst comes to worst they’ll see that I didn’t steal)

Like I said, I let a manager know and she said she’ll figure it out but I’m still really worried and also mad at myself for making such a stupid mistake.

What happens if a register comes up $40 short?",0,1627864086

835,Customer Orders Something. Doesn’t Give Gate Code To Get Into Where She Lives.,"So this happened Friday. Both funny and annoying. 

I work in a retail business that sells lumber. My job is mostly just deliveries. I had to deliveries loaded onto my truck. The second delivery was for in a town that we very rarely deliver too due to distance, which was over a hour drive away. But it was decided since I was 3/4 of the way there with my first delivery, I’d drop off the item. The customer was called by staff in the store to let them know I was coming that morning as far as I’m aware. 

The item was a roll of plastic 8 feet long, but light. I finish my first delivery, and try punching in the address for the second in my gps. There were some issues with the location because the road names weren’t matching on the gps with what my order form said. 

I give the customer a call to confirm the address, but all I get is a voicemail. So I leave her a message, saying I’m on my way, but to call me back so I can confirm where they were. I drive to where the gps took me, and there was no road or house number that matched. 

I try calling the customer again, no answer. So try googling the street in my phone, and a result came up for a little retirement trailer park on the north end of town, and I was on the south end. After fighting through traffic for over 10 minutes, I arrive. 

I recognized the park right away. This place required a gate code to get in. This gate is only meant for stopping vehicles. There were sidewalks on either side. I call the customer again, no answer. So I call the administration for the park, and explain the situation. They said if I type the customers house number into the keypad, it will call down to their unit and they have a override. But if the customer didn’t answer, I unfortunately can’t get in.

So I tried the keypad, nothing happened. I look up a map, to see where her unit is, and it was about half a mile from the front gate. 

I call down to my store, and talk to the worker who did the order. They were pissed with the customer, saying “Her telling us there is a gate would be very helpful to know.” 

She tells me she’ll try phoning, and to hold tight. After 10 minutes, I get a call back from my coworker, saying she can’t get a hold of the customer either. And she didn’t want to have me not deliver the item since it would be a long drive back. 

So she told me if I could walk to her unit, let her know I am there, I can walk back, and get my truck to deliver her item. As I prepare, I figured I might as well bring the item with me. It wasn’t heavy, and it would save going through the park twice. 

After 10 minutes of walking, I arrive, and peer into the back yard, and see the customer working. I call out, informing who I am. And I was pretty blunt in saying we had called multiple times, because we didn’t have any code to get through the gate. 

She asked me how I managed to get here, and I told her I walked with her item. She immediately started saying how sorry she was. How embarrassed she was, just saying sorry again and again and again. I just simply said “If you order anything more in the future, just remember to give us the gate code.” 

She kept saying how sorry she was, and told me to wait. I realized she was getting me a tip, so after a moment, she came back, giving me a five dollar bill. I know kinda bad to think, but I thought “I walked a half mile with a large roll of plastic and you give 5 dollars.” 

I just kept polite and said thank you, and walked back to my vehicle with her saying how sorry she was. So on my walk back, I phone my coworker, let them know what went on, and they told me when they phone the customer later, they’ll be charging her a larger delivery charge considering what I had to do. This delivery probably took closer to a hour longer then it would have under normal circumstances. 

So that was my fun. I had to drive back and have a short lunch because I had at least 8 more deliveries to try and complete before the end of the day.",0,1627831554
836,Listening to failed robberies unravel over a radio.,"So, I started a retail job at a store that had just opened up in my city a couple months ago, and I have been waiting for the day to finally tell a fun tale. I have had a couple of run-ins with lowkey ""Karen's"" for instance, on the stores opening day, I had a Karen ask me where the business shirts are, I showed her, and she said she wanted a 3 pack of business shirts, I apologised and said that we didn't have 3 packs of business shirts, and she huffed and said ""You work here and don't know where anything is?"" before walking off.... uhh yeah, it's everyone's first day, of course we're not going to know everything. lol.

&amp;#x200B;

But I digress, the story that this post is referring to just happened on my shift that I just got off of a couple hours before writing this post. for this story to make sense, our store has these ""Push to Talk"" devices (I'm unsure how many other retail stores do this, but I'm guessing it's commonplace), basically walkie talkies that are fed through an ear piece.The first encounter of the day happened about 45 minutes into my shift, I hear over the radio from a co-worker, ""Hi, a customer just came up to me saying that they saw someone shoplifting and that they're still in the store"".This obviously got my attention, since working the checkouts, there isn't a lot of insane action that goes on other than the odd peak time here and there. I then hear the Manager ask for the description of the culprits and what they were stealing, a bald man with a hat and a green jacket with a partner was stealing kitchen knives by replacing the new ones in boxes on the shelves with crap ones.My interest is peaked even more when they said that they had spotted the culprits, and I then hear over the radio, ""Okay, I'll call security, make sure you check their bags before they leave""While this is happening I'm fixing up a Click and Collect order for another customer, and when I come back out to the registers and hand the customer their items, there's two security guards and all the managers double checking everything they were buying.They ended up being let go, so my guess is that they realised they were caught trying to steal and decided to bail on that idea and just buy the items instead. and I thought that was the end of the excitement for the night.

&amp;#x200B;

But then it happened again, not even an hour after the first event, I'm back at the registers, and I hear the manager come on the radio and say ""Hi everyone on level 1, I would like you to keep an eye on a young blonde woman, she's wearing a grey jumper, and is acting really dodgy, just a heads up"" me and my co-workers at the checkouts all give eachother a look, wondering what's going on, then about 5 minutes later we hear. ""Definitely keep an eye out for her, she's definitely stealing stuff"" at this point I'm kind of chuckling, cause again, this is quite a lot of excitement for someone who stands behind a register for a good majority of the shift. We then hear, ""She's heading to the elevators, can someone on the ground floor by the back exit just stand by the elevator near mens, we just want to have a good idea of where she is"" and as this is being said, I see a manager running towards the set of escalators in the store.

And the radio chatter continues; ""She's heading towards the beauty section, can we get someone over there.""

""Can someone call security?""

""Security went home because they were sick""

""Of course they did""

""Make sure she doesn't get near the exits""

""She's just got on the elevator""

I'm keeping watch by the elevator kind of looking around, not really sure what to do at this point, just kind of thinking ""What the fuck is going on!?"" only to then hear over the radio ""She's gone into the basement!"" which made me chuckle again because the basement level hasn't been finished in our store yet, and is obviously a dead end.The rest of what happened was told to me by the manager who caught her, he chased her into the basement and into a corner where he started taking pictures of her, I'm guessing for the police so they know her appearance, and she immediately started freaking out and crying, after this she yelled ""I've got nothing left to lose!"" and charged at the manager which obviously got him to back off real fast, and she then managed to get out of the store empty handed.we scanned all of the goods she had picked up, and determined that she nearly stole 250 dollars worth of goods, including a small TV Monitor, Lego Sets, clothes, etc.In the end we kind of all came to the conclusion that it was likely a junkie trying to steal stuff from our store so she could sell it on Facebook Marketplace or Ebay to make a quick buck, the next half hour over the radio was them just describing the security camera footage, like the moment she realised she was caught, how desperately she was trying to get away, how funny it was seeing the managers chasing her around, so on.

Part of me wants to feel bad for the thief because it definitely sounded like she was in a really rough place what with how the manager described her reaction to getting caught stealing so much. but at the same time, I can't help but feel like she was likely going to sell that stuff to get another hit of ice or something.  But I guess the thing I got out of this is that there are quite a lot of eyes on you in Retail stores, even if it may not seem like it. Anyway, just thought I'd share that experience with you guys, was quite an exciting night for me. 

TL;DR - a couple got caught trying to steal knives, had security called on them and ended up paying for them anyway, and a woman tried stealing 250 dollars worth of merchandise, was chased around the store for 15 minutes before leaving empty handed.",0,1627826306

839,Asking for ID brings out the worst in some people,"I've been working at a gas station in Idaho for almost a year and a half, and I have plenty of stories to tell from my work past. I'm not sure why but asking ID from people has a 70/30 chance of them either complying with you or try to make a snarky comment on why you have to ID them. Like any gas stations or retail establishments we have beer doors and a beer cooler that you must be at least 21 or older to enter or grab one. On the very front of our entrance we have a big ol' sign that states we will ID you for items such as cigarettes and alcohol, on the beer cooler door we have another sign that you must be 21+ to enter and our glass mirror by our registers have a big sign saying we will ID you. We have to pay attention to the people who come in pairs or in groups, for example if you stay outside of the beer cooler or don't have any alcohol on you we won't ID you if only one of you guys goes in but the others stays out. But if your whole group of six people all go to the beer cooler or grab any alcohol we will ID your entire group. If one of you don't have an ID or if one of you guys has an expired license, we won't sell the entire group anything. Once you start coming in more often in my gas station and I ID you more. I won't ID you if you become a regular at our store. 

So here we are working a swing shift with my other cashier co-worker taking a break, when a group of four people happily greet me and head towards the beer cooler.  They seem cool and nice at first, a group of what I assumed were college kids just getting a couple brewskies to drink. All four of them grab something and stand behind two people in line. I helped an old lady with gas and a regular grabbing his smokes he always gets. Now it's time for the group of four consisting of three chicks and a guy. All of four them put their six pack of beer and cases on the counter as I start to ring em up. I tell them how's their day going the usual stuff making small talk with the customers, all seem happy telling me they were heading to a party. Cool beans, the ladies stand behind the guy who had his ID ready for me and was about to pull his credit card out. I thanked the guy for showing me his ID without me telling him and I asked if everybody else has their ID on them. They told me he was the one paying so they don't have to show me, the guy stated the same thing as the ladies did and told me they don't have to. I assured them they did have to show me their ID as they went into an area only meant for people who are 21+. They reassured me they didn't have to since he was the one paying. I can start noticing one of the the chicks getting annoyed by me and rolling her eyes as I state once again I do have to see of all their IDs in order to complete to purchase. The guy in the group suddenly wants to go all macho man on me and says ""whatever they don't need their ID"" and inserts his credit card into my card reader. Me started to get a little flustered tell them all I have to do is hit complete sale and finish this transaction since I already have your credit card information on my system but just please show me your IDs ladies. They tell me I didn't ID the guy in front of them who bought cigarettes and told me he looks younger then them, I once again reassured them I ID him the first time I saw him and multiple times after that. I told them he's a regular who buys the same cigarettes and lotto tickets once or twice a day. The thing they did next kinda made me laugh and caught me off guard. Chick #2 in the group says fuck you and tries to complete their purchase on our self-checkout machines. Funny enough they need my badge barcode to verify they're 21. So here we are a bunch of college looking adults standing in a hissy fit because I won't sell them beer. Finally after 5 minutes of dealing with them, chick #3 says I don't have my ID and chick #2 has her ID but its expired. Oh boy I just tell them I'm not selling you any of you guys beer. They all flip me off and called me a fucking loser  as they tell each other to head to another gas station. Oh wells, luckily for me they were the only customers at the store during that time and I just go ahead and put their stuff back where it went and continued my evening shift.",0,1627804748

842,Got called a b*tch at my new job for the first time,"i would first like to say that i’m new to reddit and this sub so if there’s anything that’s probably not in the ordinary it’s because i’m not very good at using this site. 

so i started working as a cashier two weeks ago and for the most part i’ve been pretty good at the job considering i have never worked in my entire life (i’m 18 btw). i was also having a pretty good day yesterday too because i finally was able to hold a conversation with a coworker without being awkward as hell lol. 

anyways yesterday is where everything starts. it was like 7:50pm and i leave at like 8, so one of my senior coworkers told me to shut off my light because i would be leaving soon and she didn’t want me to suddenly have a huge line to deal with. i only had two customers left, i was already ringing one of them up and at the time, i didn’t notice the other customer that was in line. i finished ringing up the first customer and then thats when i noticed my next customer which was a little girl. i was about to also ring her up because she came in line before i shut off my light. However, my bagger told me “what are you doing? we’re done”. i shouldn’t have listened to him tbh because he was also new. anyways i told the little girl that this lane was closed, and she was going to have to go to the next line. she responded saying “well my mom is going to be frustrated”, i laughed it off not knowing the mom would be MORE than frustrated :’) 

a minute or so later as i was about to leave, the mom came up and spoke in an already annoyed tone saying “where’s the lady before me??” (she was asking for the previous customer which idky) and i proceeded to tell her that the lane was closed. she then yelled saying “i was already in line when the light was on and now you telling me we can’t do it here??”. it was my first time interacting w a mad customer so i panicked and just repeated that the lane was closed, and thats when she said “man whatever you bitch” :’) 

she then went to my senior coworker who was ringing up her items and proceeded to rant to her about me and kept saying “SHE KNEW TOO I WAS THERE! SHE KNEW” which i genuinely did not know until my first customer was done. but it just bugged me when my coworker kept telling her “i’m sorry about that”. i already felt like that whole situation was my fault and the sorrys confirmed it for me :’) 

this honeslty isn’t that big of a deal, it’s just been bothering me all day yesterday and today. i have a really hard time socializing and this job was helping me a lot, but this one small situation felt like i been set back. 

i just want to ask, do you guys think this was my fault? i feel like it partly is, but at the same time i felt like she was being unreasonable, considering by the time she went to the other cashier, her items were already being rung up, so she wasn’t really wasting any time. but yeah idk! just wanted to spill all of this somewhere and didn’t know where, i really hope this was the right sub to go to lol.",0,1627785923

I used to work for a boutique wine store in Ontario.

Cx: But I don’t want wine, I want Champagne!

855,"The vodka must glow because, Chernobyl","So a tiny bit of context first, I have been working for a major wine/liquor store for about a year and a half and primarily deal with wine, but do work with other liquors too. This actually only happened about 2 hours ago so I’m still trying to process this interaction. I did not take part in the actual interaction but was witness about 3 feet away for the event. 

So I came around the corner from our receiving room to find one of my assistant managers helping a couple of customers. They apparently are looking for vodka and my manager recommends one of our best vodkas that isn’t particularly well known and mentions that she’s had it before and that it’s very smooth. The customer then asked where it came from, and my manager tells them it’s from Ukraine. Now this triggers a really strange physical response, as if they were recoiling in fear. They then say that they won’t get anything from Ukraine. Now this is certainly a bit strange but customers do and believe weird things sometimes. My manager just sort of shrugs it off at first and just tells them that it’s really smooth and that she thinks they’d enjoy it. This triggers one of the couple to suddenly launch into a passionate 3 or 4 minute rant about Chernobyl. He goes on to say that he knows all about the Chernobyl disaster (which mind you happened in 1986) and that it’s still burning and spewing radiation that that the cloud covered everything. He mentions that he knows that the famed elephant foot in the plant is going to burn for, in his words, fifty thousand years and that he is not going to even touch anything from Ukraine because he knows it’s all radioactive and that it’s irresponsible for us to keep it in our store. This leaves both me and my manager completely speechless. I mean how do you respond to that? The customers just sorta march off as if they’d won some great victory in an argument with us. I was totally speechless for a few minutes after because, do people seriously think that the this is still such an active problem in day to day life even now?

I know that the Chernobyl nuclear power plant is an ongoing issue in Ukraine and that they are still trying to figure out what to do with it. But the radiation isn’t near as widespread as it was in the first days after the disaster but these people seemed to genuinely believe that the entire country of Ukraine is an irradiated wasteland and that anything from there is inherently deadly or toxic to human life.",0,1627685065

She explained she just grabbed it and is disposing of her batteries before going through the shop.

A while back, I was manning the dreaded self check. It wasn't too busy, which was a relief, but did afford me the opportunity to help the clueless customer. 

CC was making a small purchase, just a candy bar, but he was having trouble. No problem, that's what I'm here for. I approached CC as he frantically waved me down to see what was going on.

The problem? The machine just wouldn't accept his $5 bill. He demonstrated how it wouldn't go in, no matter how he flattened or smoothed it. The machine was broken. 

Now, normally, this is something that happens a lot. Bills that aren't perfect get rejected. The machine just wasn't trying, though. After I took a second look at the machine, the problem became apparent: ""Sir,"" I asked, ""Do you know you have to scan your item before you can pay for it?"" 

CC's eyes widened, and he turned red, doing an epic facepalm. He scanned his candy and the machine happily took his money. We both got to enjoy a laugh as he wandered off to tell his friends what he had done.

859,I am apparently a crook and a liar,"This happened a few months ago now, but it will probably be one of the more memorable interactions for years to come. There will also be a tl;dr at the bottom, I am apparently long winded.

&amp;#x200B;

I work in a decently sized liquor store, and the other day during a woman came in. I saw her and asked if she needed any help, and she said that one of my co-workers had actually just helped her. I said great, and to let me know if she needed any help or had any questions. Same woman was hanging around my area so after another 5 minutes I asked her if she was still doing alright and she said she was doing fine. A couple more minutes pass and she is leaving my area and I just triple checked, and asked if she found what she was looking for. The woman said yup! and went on her way towards the front. 

&amp;#x200B;

Here is where the story starts takes a turn. A different co-worker paged back to me and was asking about the price of a bottle that the woman had picked up. I told my co-worker the price ($30.99) and they informed me she thinks that she saw the price for $24.99. I told my co-worker to let me look around and I'd be up in a second. 

&amp;#x200B;

I went and checked the shelf tag, it was the correct price. I went to check the display tag, it was the correct price. Last place to check was a large display table and I found the bottle Karen picked up, next to another bottle that had a tag for $24.99. I picked up both bottles as I found them and walked them up front. I politely explained that the bottles were sitting right next to each other and that while the tag for her bottle was missing, the other bottle was labelled correctly, and that we would not be selling her the bottle she wanted for $24.99. 

&amp;#x200B;

As I am explaining this to her she starts muttering under her breath that she knew she should have taken a picture of the bottles, or that she should have brought the bottle with the tag up. I told her I'm sorry, if the bottles would have been labelled incorrectly we would have matched the price, but that was not the case. She then states that she doesn't want the bottle and I say that is fair, so I take the bottle and put it back on the table. 

&amp;#x200B;

This woman then proceeds to hang around the store after her purchase, and eventually talks to a manager about how I must have switched the tags around so we would not give her the price she saw. My manager then asked her if she knew what bottle it was, or what I looked like, or what the price was supposed to be. Conveniently she didn't know the answers to any of those.  HOWEVER, in her 1-star google review she at least knew what I was wearing and that it must be nice to watch the Olympics all day, and that she cannot believe I still have a job with the terrible customer service I gave her.

861,I hate old customers sometimes,"For context, I’m a teenager working at a grocery store. I don’t remember the exact time when it happened, but it was the first “true” Karen I’ve ever dealt with. That day, I was working the cash register, and this old lady in an electric scooter comes to my line. She wanted her refrigerated stuff separate from her freezer stuff in plastic then in paper bags. Me and the sacker we’re trying our best to keep them separated, but then she said to put the bag with the chemicals (the cleaners and stuff) in the refrigerated paper bag. After all of that, she gives me an old receipt with a bottle of vitamins and says “I want to return this; I got the wrong kind” even though it was purchased a month ago. I call my supervisor, and he takes it and walks over to the manager. I could tell that she was angry. He was able to process the return thankfully- saving me and the sacker from being yelled at. 

Then she tries to pay with check. At my store, we accept checks, but a valid ID must be present so we can copy down the numbers and stuff. I ask for her ID, but then she says that she lost it, but had the numbers and stuff already written down on the check. I told her that I couldn’t process it without the ID for verification purposes, and then she begins digging in her purse for it. 5 minutes passed and she thankfully found it so I was able to complete the transaction. I have her the receipt and told her “have a good day” and she didn’t even say anything. Luckily the customers behind her were understanding and weren’t upset because of the wait.",0,1627631103

864,Let me Google that for you...,"It's shipping season (college/leases changing over) and I work in the copy center of an office supply chain with the shipping drop off point my department. I'm also in a bigger college town. We only accept prepaid labels for our shipping partner, or new shipments, which I create a ticket/label for in store. 

So, we DO NOT ship via QR codes, even if they were provided by our shipping partners. We even have a few handy signs stating this. With locations of the two nearest locations that accept QR codes.. Most people who come in with a code accept  this information once explained. Some need to be reminded.

The ones who really bother me are the 20-30 something (and I'm in this age range so I'm not being biased) who come up to my counter with the QR  code on their phone and say, ""can't you just scan it?"" 

And then I explain that we can't, but where they can ""just scan it"" and then they say, ""where is that?"" And I look at the phone, still displaying the QR code and say, ""I'm sure you can look that up faster than I can!"" with the brightest smile on my face.",0,1627621885

873,The time I was accused of the federal crime of deactivating a customers card,"I had just got in for the day and had to cover ‘Riley’ at SCOs first 15. So I dismiss her and a few moments later I see a blinker and go to help.
Me: How may I help you ma’am?

Customer: MY CARD ISN’T WORKING!

M: okay what is the error message you keep getting?

C: IT JUST WON’T ACCEPT MY CARD!!!!

M: okay I’ll reset the card reader and then we can try again
So I created a suspend slip and tried to rescan the transaction into the machine but ofc the slip didn’t work, she only had 7 items so I quickly rerang up her items and compared the totals to make sure everything was scanned correctly 
M: okay it’ll be $32.09

C: THAT’S THE WRONG TOTAL YOU DOUBLE SCANNED!!!!
I then double check again that the totals are the same from the suspend slip then go back and look at the sales screen and everything is only rung up once 
M: sorry ma’am but there’s no item listed twice and all items that are scanned are in your bag, is there something you’d like to remove?

C: NO RING IT UP AGAIN!!! THIS TIME I’LL KEEP AN EYE ON YOU!
So I scan everything again and get the exact same total
M: your total will be $32.09

C: THE MACHINE IS WRONG! THATS NOT THE CORRECT TOTAL!!!

To my luck but not my supervisors he just happened to be passing through SCO and I needed to try and deescalate the situation and I figured I should pass her up before she gets more upset and ask my boss to ring her out quickly he agrees and gets the same total as me 

C: THE LIPSTICK WAS $3 NOT 6!!!

our company policy is to just change the price if it’s not a significant loss so he just changes the price of the lipstick 
Supervisor: okay sorry about that ma’am, your total will be $28.88

C: THAT’S BETTER!!!!
So she tries to pay again and once again her card declines, when a card declines there are multiple reasons for it and we don’t assume it just because the card doesn’t have enough funds so we try to go through the list but she’s very defensive and none of the other ways make any difference so we tell her she just has to contact the card provider to see why the card isn’t working. She however believes that I have broken her card and starts screaming that at the top of her lungs

C: SHE BROKE MY CARD!
S: Ma’am she didn’t 
C: IF ONLY I HAD KEPT A BETTER EYE ON HER, HAVE HER TURN OUT MY POCKETS AND GIVE ME MY MONEY BACK!!!
 
I am still at SCO and can hear her screaming and so can the other customers who are turning their heads to look at the scene she’s causing

C: I HAVE A DISABILITY AND THIS IS MY GOVERNMENT ISSUED CRIME MESSING WITH THE CARD IS A FEDERAL CRIME

My supervisor tries to tell her that I didn’t steal her money and that I can’t deactivate her card and that she just needs to contact the card issuer regarding any details of why her transaction won’t go through 

W: IT WAS WORKING THIS MORNING!!!
SHE BROKE IT AND THAT'S A FEDERAL CRIME!!!!

S: since it wasn’t working at the SCO either you may have an insufficient balance or a fraud alert on your card

W: NO I HAVE ENOUGH MONEY SHE MUST HAVE CHARGED AT THE SCO, BECAUSE I KNOW HOW MUCH MONEY I HAVE AND IT’S ENOUGH!!
I WASN’T PAYING ATTENTION TO WHAT SHE WAS DOING BECAUSE I HAD TO LOOK AWAY SINCE SHE HAS BAD BREATH!!

B: Ma’am I’m going to have to ask that you calm down, we can try your card again or you can pay another way

W: ITS A FEDERAL CRIME!!! 

She ended up leaving without her items and not to long later ‘Riley’ returned from her 15 blissfully unaware of the craziness that she had just barely missed",0,1627544666

876,Known Shoplifter Gets Told,"The store I run is in a nicer mall in an upscale part of Southern California. Sadly, the local law enforcement has made it known that they won’t really help us fight shoplifting, so the idiots run amuck. This is the story of how I chased one off, hopefully permanently.

Over the weekend, my junior manager sent a video of a kid stealing an item from the store. This brain surgeon stuffed it in his pocket right on camera, then bolted from the store. We knew he’d done it before, but now we had the proof…but what to do with it?

Monday morning comes, I’m working with my senior sales associate, and who comes in? Our friend the knucklehead! We look at each other, and he kind of smirks, then starts hanging about his favorite area. My associate is all over it, not leaving him alone for an instant, when I got an idea.

“Hey, associate? Did I show you the video of the idiot who stole the brownie mix last Friday? We got him on camera stuffing it in his pocket, then running out the door like a moron. He probably thinks it’s got the THC in it, went home, made the brownies and spent the weekend thinking he was stoned…that idiot strikes me as being that stupid.”

She picked up on it pretty quickly, and we laughed about how stupid this kid was, right in his face, all without ever hinting that we knew it was him. He kept side-eyeing me, getting more and more annoyed, until he finally turned and stormed away, heading for the door. I followed him out, and as he walked away, I dropped the final bombshell.

“Oh, hey…don’t ever come back. You’re banned from the store for theft.”

He didn’t acknowledge it, but the store across from us heard me, and I ended up sending that manager the video as well, and she’s sharing it with other managers in the mall. He hasn’t been seen these last couple of days…",0,1627491177

879,My first truly INSANE customer,"TW: Lots of Racism, Homophobia, violence and probably more

Hey everyone this is my first post so I apologize in advance if I mess up with how its made or whatever but this is something I just really had to share. Buckle up it’s going to be a long and crazy road ahead. This whole story sounds fake but trust me its not I wish it was because I feel terrible even parroting what he said.

I bit of background for this story is that I work as the yard man for a popular Canadian farm/garden/hardware supply store so I am NOT used to stuff like this. I was a farm kid and don’t spend as much time with customers as other staff so needless to say my customer service skills are not 100% I say stuff as it is so that probably made this situation much worse.
Also this customer was probably 300+ lbs and 4 1/2’ when i’m muscular, 6’2” and 230lbs (just so you guys can picture him yelling LOL) 
Important names (not our actual names)
crazy customer = “Kevin”
Me = “rob”

I had a customer come in today that was a lot more lets say talkative and open than the regular person should be. Right off the bat I could tell they were a serious a$$ interrupting, questioning everything, making fun of people and just being an overall terrible customer. He began by asking where our hardware cloth was I told him where but followed up with “which type are you looking for, because we are sold out of sizes 1”x1/2”, 1”x1/4”…” he just blew up! Saying what the F**K did I ask what types you don’t have, DID I? NO! I was asking where they are! So I tell him where they are and he waddles over.

I thought that would be the end of that, i was not that lucky, got a frantic radio call from a cashier lets call her “Morgan” saying “”Bob” please come up to cash when ASAP I have a customer looking for something and saying you sent him to the wrong place” all the while you can hear “Kevin” yelling in the background. I go up, once he sees me he hobbles over and points his mini sausage finger to my face saying “You Lying 
FA@@OT (Im not homosexual so TF is that about) YOU SAID THERE WERE LOTS OVER THERE!” I did not I even said we are probably out before. After listening to him hurl every swear a 14 year old would know I somehow managed to calm him down and have him come outside so we could look together. Sure enough we had none of the right hardware cloth, he said some more choice words than retreated back to the door, on his way he noticed a 300 gallon stock trough and decided the price was the same as the 42 gallon trough 7 spots to the right. After more yelling he calmed down and started oversharing about his beliefs like how masks don’t work, people are sheep if they use them and spouted off about pointless numbers and graphs that don’t mean anything. 

This is the funny part he began talking about how people are being mind controlled by the government and how the government is run by $&amp;@?!’s (Awful racial slur used to discriminate against Chinese people) and how our $&amp;@?! overlords are controlling and watching all of the people.  He said something about assassinating Justin Tredeua and deporting all non-white people and killing all Muslims before they kill us. He also said lots about homosexuals being exterminated and going to hell. “Kevin” loved saying how he is very smart actually double the average IQ of people like me. Even though he was that smart he couldn’t figure out how to use a computer. He was angry the store used security cameras because he didn’t consent to being recorded.

EXHALE… I think that is it

FYI this was not in the correct order once he began being racist, homophobic and violent I told him to get out of the store and if he didn’t i would call the cops. He went coward mode and left thankfully.

880,My first unreasonable customer.,"I started working retail a little over three years ago as a side job to my long time factory job. I'm divorced and the kids are grown so I was bored and applied when a new store came to town and they hired me, big surprise to me, but I'm older and responsible so they work with me on the hours and it works out. 
     I've actually been having a pretty good time with it since it's so different from my full time job and I really wondered about the horror stories people tell about the horrible customers they encounter until about a month ago.
     I was working the register when an older gentleman comes in and starts raising hell about something, I'm occupied and there was a new boss talking to him so I wasn't paying much attention. The new boss is a younger girl and she's a real sweetie and I don't think she deals with things like that well so this guy is just reaming her.
      One of our services is filling propane tanks, like you use on a grill, and I guess this guy is missing an O ring to his tank. He is saying we are responsible for maintaining the tanks and we need to take care of this problem for him. New boss is trying to help him but she screwed up at first and told him we don't maintain the tanks and that wasn't what he wanted to hear so he's on a rant, a rant like I haven't heard out of a customer. 
     I finish with a customer and have a bit of time so I walk over and catch up with what is going on just as he's talking about our responsibility to maintain his tank again so I step in and tell him we fill the tanks and that is it. I tell him we don't have parts, training or any kind of tools to work on tanks. He isn't having it and seems even more angry that I'm arguing with him and keeps repeating himself about our responsibilities so I ask if the gas station where he fills his car is responsible for maintaining it which pushes him further over the edge but he just keeps repeating the same thing over and over like it didn't matter what we said, if it wasn't what he wanted to hear he wasn't going to acknowledge it. 
     I finally just told him he needed to leave and he told me wouldn't be back. I don't recall ever seeing him there before so I doubt he'll be missed but now I know what it's like to have an unreasonable customer.",0,1627430564

888,$600~ in overage charges and it’s allegedly my fault.,"(Sorry for formatting, on mobile)

So a bit of background, I work for a retailer that provides mobile service.

There are 4 major characters to this story, me (OP), coworker (CW), angry lady (AL), angry lady’s mom (AM)

So earlier today, I have a customer (AL) that comes in angry and upset and I ask how I can help them. 

She begins to give me a very lengthy explanation about how she signed up for our mobile services from CW and had racked up $600+ in charges for a shared plan on her mother’s (AM) account. 

She begins to tell me about how her mother (AM) is on fixed income and how she can’t afford it and she’s going through a lot in life right now. So I express my sympathy and attempt to help her out, just walking into the situation. 

This is where it gets interesting.

Every time I would try to read off what is on my computer system or billing ledger for her, she would interrupt me and go on a tirade about how that’s not what she signed up for, or how the billing is incorrect.

As it turns out, the person berating me (AL) was the one who racked up all the charges. 
And when I tell her that, she explains to me that her some has autism and uses the phone non stop. Not a problem, but it still doesn’t resolve the fact that she was the one who went over. She then tells me that all of her phones on that plan should have been unlimited. I called up CW who helped them and he confirmed they signed up for a shared plan to which she (AL) profusely refused and told me it was supposed to be unlimited when in fact, my coworker had told me they insisted on the shared plan. 

She switched to unlimited but the charges remained because it was from a past billing statement. 

She demands I refund her (which I have legit no authority to do so especially for a $600+ credit), so I email my supervisors and regional managers about what I should do.

At that point all I could do was send an email and provide her some phone numbers to get her pointed in the right direction. 

By this point AL was calmer and apologetic and thanked me for helping her.


Not 30 minutes later, she (AL) comes back in and interrupts me while I’m helping other customers and berates me in front of other customers and shouts at me that they will not refund her. So she forcefully puts her phone into my hands and has me speak to the phone rep and they explain to me it was a legitimate charge because they cannot refund her. So, shes shouting at me while I’m talking to this phone rep, and before I can get more information from this rep, she snatched her phone out of my hands and said “fuck this, fuck all of you, we’re going to the bank and cancelling the charges and switching carriers” and abruptly leaves. 


The only person I felt honestly bad for was the mom. And apparently she was more upset than AL. 


TL:DR: was thrown into a situation I had no hand in, angry lady comes in racking up $600+ charges in overages, demands I refund her, I can’t. Comes back to berate me more and basically tells me to go fuck myself.",0,1627359590
889,Dumbest phone call I’ve ever received,"I work in third-party debt collections meaning we service accounts on behalf of the creditor.

This guy called in, and started immediately screaming and cursing at me saying we spam call him constantly multiple times a day (which isn’t true as we are only allowed to dial a number once daily, and most accounts only get called every 3 days). 

I wasn’t able to pull up his number associated with an account because he was using a spoof number, so asked him the number we were calling. Conversation went like this (paraphrased):

898,Working with a “No Return/Refund” policy…,"My coworkers and I suffered so much abuse because of the store’s No Return policy. 

For context, it was a Beach Shop in a really popular tourist destination. The policy existed because people on vacation would buy everything they needed, then return it all at the end of their stay. It was also a health/safety issue because people often tried to return their worn or broken bathing suits. I’m not exaggerating—2/3 times, the bottoms presented to me would have skid marks in them. I kept disinfectant spray at my counter because of it. 

To deter this, my boss put up giant signs *everywhere* that said “No Returns/Refunds,” followed up with the details (all this was in place years before I started working there). Employees were required to repeat it before every transaction and it was printed on every receipt. Despite this, people would still come back determined to get a refund. 

Once, a lady had a full on meltdown because she couldn’t return her ripped up bathing suit top. She was crying, screaming, shaking, and chased my boss around the store with it. I had to call the police for them to make her leave.
Another time, a grown man chucked their beach chair at my 5’2 female coworker.

Regardless of how people feel about the policy, the store absolutely was within their rights to enforce it. No one tricked the customers either—it’s actually embarrassing how in-your-face we had to be about the policy. So why did customers still try to return things then go crazy when they couldn’t?",0,1627293886

900,The day where everything happened so much,"I work at a store known locally in my area for being pretty chaotic, and while it's usually much calmer after covid upset the atmosphere and allowed us to get the store under control, we still have a lot of ""what the fuck"" events that occur on the regular. Most of them are related to shoplifters or customers that get brainworms when they walk through the door and forget how normal human beings are supposed to act. One day in particular, However, I was working a long shift at the fitting room, and it was the strangest one on record so far.

First thing I see when I walk in is the coworker I'm replacing, looking uneasy. I expect her to warn me that there's a trouble customer, and in  a way, she does... A customer has been in one of the fitting rooms for an hour. I take her place, and both of my managers appear, one of them hanging out with me and the other inspecting the fitting rooms. It was busy when I showed up, but soon enough, there's nobody else in the fitting room but her, and while wandering manager is nearby, the woman inside peeks out, then immediately locks the door as WM approaches. Another hour passes. We occasionally hear clicking, probably from her trying to defeat the hard tags on the clothes she's undoubtedly trying to steal. Eventually, One of the managers knocks on the door, and tells her she needs to leave. She comes out begrudgingly, claiming that she fell asleep, leaving the clothes she was trying on; two have the price tags ripped off, one has a hole where the hard tag was violently ripped out, she's left HER OWN sweatshirt in with the mix, and one of the items she went in with is missing. 

I think peace has returned to the fitting room. Managers scatter, and we start going about our normal business. One of my coworkers comes to clean the bathrooms, which are about ten feet away from where I have to stand all day. Not even fifteen quiet, incredibly normal minutes later, another coworker comes to throw something away and finds a number of very bloody paper towels in the trash by the bathrooms. I check in one of the bathrooms, and find even more. There's so much blood. The bathrooms are locked with a pin pad, anyone I let in has to walk by me to leave, and my racks and caddies and such are placed so that I'm usually facing the bathrooms when I'm working on things... And yet neither I, nor any of my coworkers constantly coming and going, noticed any event that would have caused blood, much less cleaned up blood ending up in the trash OUTSIDE the bathroom in plain sight. I can only guess that one of the people I let in predicted and quickly dealt with a nosebleed, but... why put some of the cleanup outside? And so much? I just don't get it.

Finally, as if fate knew that I felt safe, my manager finds the shirt. He picks up  a shirt that someone has abandoned where it doesn't belong, and as the resident wrangler of textile goods, he brings it to me. He hands it to me. I grab it.

It is wet.

I Immediately say ""\[Manager\], what the hell?"" and he's obviously concerned, as that's an unusual reaction for a fitting room attendant to have when being given a shirt. Upon inspection, it's soaked around the hard tag, so soaked in fact that the price tag is completely dissolved and mostly gone. He takes it, and I forget about the incident after washing away the memories with hand sanitizer. Later, though, as I'm going on my last break, I get up to the front to do my walk and a bunch of employees and the managers are there, chatting about the lady from earlier. After a little chatter, I ask my manager if he found out why the shirt was wet. He explained that he had checked the cameras, and found that the shirt had been abandoned by a family... with small children.

Basically, a child sucked the price tag right off a shirt.

""I've *been* waiting""

Which she had, but literally for just a minute or two. I go back to helping the guy at the counter and a few seconds later she slams her drink down and screams

""YOU KNOW WHAT, I'LL JUST GO SOMEWHERE ELSE. YOU SON OF A BITCH!""

and starts storming out. I call out 

""Sorry about that ma'am. I hope your day goes better""

She just goes ""I HOPE YOURS DOESN'T"" as she leaves.

Don't know if anybody on this sub will actually even want to read a story like this, but just in case, here it is.

I work in a big brand clothing retail store, but a smaller shop, and our shop was incredibly busy today. I woke up feeling very ill, but I'm too stubborn to take a sick day quite yet, plus I was asked to come in early today, so I knew things needed doing and I didn't want to let the shop down (I have the type of managers that you don't want to let down, I am very lucky).

I didn't come off the till too much today, but I was grateful because I didn't know what to do with myself off the till. Motor functions are automatic when you've done them however many thousands of times; scanning, unhanging, detagging, folding, bagging, wash, rinse, repeat. However, to clear rail or tidy, it was too hard to focus myself and do my job properly as my head was so clouded. 

Regardless, a couple of hours before closing, a lady was returning some clothes she'd bought, and notably had brought back a pyjama set which I'd had my eye on online, but didn't want to buy because of packaging waste and whatnot, I prefer to buy big bundles of clothes online, so at least I'm wasting mess materials that way. Anyway, as soon as I pulled them out of her bag, she started gushing about how much she loved those pyjamas because they made her feel so happy when she looked at them, just being extremely sweet in general. She said she was only returning this pair as she had bought two sizes and kept the ones that fit.

The ones she brought back were my size so I got really excited and told her I'm definitely buying them now that she has spoken them up so much, and it felt like a sign that she'd brought them in today. As I was filing the rest of her returns and her purchases, I said to her ""you know, when I wear those pyjamas I'm going to think of you?"" And she gleefully said ""well I'll think of you when I next wear mine!"" And she then told me that she loved these pyjamas so much that she'd taken a picture of herself with her dog in her lap that morning to send to her mum to tell her how much she loved her new pyjamas, and then she showed me the picture and her dog was beautiful! Then she showed me a picture of her other dog!! I love customers like this, they make the harder days feel so much easier ❤️❤️❤️",0,1627242102

913,Customers think I'm different people,"So I manage a vape shop and half the time, I bother to come in with a full face of wild makeup and a wig in some kind of flamboyant hairstyle. The other half of the time, it's just bare face and whatever hairstyle my real hair cooperates enough to do that morning. I also wear glasses which I don't wear when I dress up since the false eyelashes tickle the lenses and I hate it. 

Unbeknownst to me until fairly recently, I look like a totally different person when I dress up and it's apparently so stark that some customers don't recognize me what so ever. I've had regulars return the next day for help with a mod or wanting to get a new juice flavor and they'll say stuff like ""the other short woman"" or ""the girl with the *insert color here* hair"" when referring to me the day prior. 

A man just came in earlier and asked me what my name was, followed by ""OH okay, there's another girl who looks just like you in here sometimes and I know one of you is *mutual friend's* ex but I wasn't sure which one of you it was"". 

A few weeks ago a regular who always comes in during my shifts asked me if I was new. I wasn't aware at that point that customers thought I was a different person sometimes so I thought he was joking at first. I explained that I wear wigs sometimes and assured him I'd been working here for a very long time and I've helped him with many things but I still don't think he believes me.",0,1627235736
914,Running with the pickles,"A few months ago I was working a rather regular afternoon shift at my truck stop, as my part of Canada is still rather caught up in the pandemic it is still up to me to enforce the mask mandates, but that isn't what I'm telling a tale about today. 

I had a customer come in, no mask and he promptly asked for one, I was quite surprised to be honest most times getting customers to mask up can be like herding cats or other unpleasant tasks. I hand over one of the ones we keep for customers and off he goes to peruse the aisles, just like every other customer.

The story takes a turn for the odd here, he picks up one of our to go sandwiches and makes for the hallway in the middle of the truck stop to where the bathrooms are, I speak up and tell him that he can't take the sandwich with him since he hasn't paid for it yet, he then throws the sandwich back into the cooler, snags a bag of dill pickle slices we sell as snacks and books it for the door, he's long gone before I get past the shock of it to follow him out. I guess he must've been really hungry and the sad part of it was if he was having money issues I'd have almost certainly bought him some food, but alas, the shift then became the day someone shoplifted pickles in front of me.",0,1627234088
915,"Woman tries to argue that a flag was on clearance, but it wasn't."," 

Football season had started a while back at my store, so we were putting out some flags for our college football team. So no item that has the logo on it would be on clearance (this is going to be important later). We are also a register in an obscure part of the store less than 10ft from an exit. We have a security door and have to press a button to let people out but we still need to be on guard. Enter a woman at our register (C) and a coworker (CW) and myself (M).

M: Can i check you out for today?

C: Yes, sir. Is everything super busy?

M: Yes, ma'am. The store is moving quick to get ready for tailgate season.

I get to this 10ft (3m) tall knife flag. And it has a clearance sticker on it. Thinking that it can't be right, I look at the sticker and scan it. It rings up as a beach towel. I quickly void the item and peel the sticker off (which was loose) and put it on my desk. And then ring up the correct barcode.

C: That is supposed to be 15 dollars.

M: Ma'am, that price would be for the label that's right here. (I show her the clearance label) And the item it's listed for is a beach towel. You can see the item name on that label. This is a knife flag we just put on the shelves a few days ago. It couldn't be on clearance.

C: But it's on sale.

M: The knife flag is not, ma'am. The beach towel that this label belongs to, is. There is nothing I can do except ring you up at this price (64 dollars) for the flag.

C: IT'S ON SALE. SELL IT TO ME FOR 15 DOLLARS.

CW (walking up): What seems to be the problem?

M (discreetly): This woman is trying to purchase this item with a label for a different item from the clearance section.

CW: Ma'am this label is for an entirely separate item. We cant sell it to you at this price.

So she rants and raves. We give her the knife flag back, she also snatched the label which I SHOULD have thrown away) and goes toward the garden center register (about half the time customers that do the garden/automotive register dance are usually up to no good to begin with). I call LP and have them follow her. She does the same thing at the garden center register (she reapplied the label) and said it was on sale. They denied it, so she left the flag there, and left the store with haste. I was correct in my standing as the flag was NOT on clearance and she tried it on the electronics register before mine.

Then she holds up a manual for another item and points to the page and at first I thought she needed a spare part from that page but really she was just mad that the bottom third of the manual was cut off somehow. She angrily ranted at how this was inconvenient to the task rabbit people she assigned to build the furniture for her. I asked if the cut manual prevented them from building the item and she says no. 🙄

I called the manager and they ended up giving her two $5 gift cards just to get her to stfu and leave.",0,1627229168

I told her as nice as I could not to rush me as it won’t make me go faster. She did this twice, and I said the same thing. And I tried her patience by “pretending” I lost count and had to start over again, and boy she acted as if she was about to blow her top.

I work at a running shoe store. We offer a military discount. Usually, people will ask if we offer one while I’m ringing them up so I can add it to the transaction.

This time around, I ring this guy up. He inserts his card. It goes through. And it was then that he flashed his military ID.

Me: Oh, I’m sorry, but I can’t apply the discount now because your payment already went through.
Him, with an attitude: Well, I don’t want the shoes then! 
Me: Fine, I’ll go get the manager.

The manager is the only one able to handle returns anyways, so they had to return it to his card before they could apply the discount. He only saved like $8 on a ~$85-$90 purchase.

I just need to know if there’s any store out there that can apply a discount after payment has already gone through without having to return/jump through a hoop to void the transaction, because I’ve genuinely never seen one.",0,1627180459
922,Susan and the Lace Dress,"I work at a liquidation store where everything is new and discounted. A lady whom I’ll call Susan (and didn’t seem very situationally aware) came in and assumed that everything I sold was junk and then asked if the Swarovski jewelry “had a guarantee.” That’s all she asked for. I told her no, as directed, and said that she was more than welcome to contact Swarovski and see if they could give her any warranty. I also let her know that it would be final sale: no returns, no exchanges. She picked out a ring and I told her again before she paid. Mind you there are also signs that say the same thing. As soon as I give her her receipt she went: “If there’s a problem with it, I can return it, right?” I said “No,” and paused before saying, “I told you that it’s final sale. Twice. Have a good day.” She didn’t say anything until right after to her son (she thought she was out of earshot): “[actuallyboa] is SO RUDE!!” So I’m going to get that tattooed on my arm tonight (/s). As for the lace dress, it was a very pretty muted pink dress that someone didn’t want to hang up. So they threw it on top of the hanging ones and the gaps got stuck in the hangers so I had to pull the poor thing out on a step stool, I’m not short, but the customer threw it 7 feet tall maybe. Yep.

924,“I Want To Buy Cigarettes From You!”,"We have a regular at the gas station I work. Tho not really a typical regular. Comes in daily. 

She came in one evening and said she wanted to buy smokes. I was like “sure, what kind do you want?” And the response was just a “what do you have?” Which I thought kinda odd since we’ve a big wall just behind me with all our cigarettes and cigars on display. But I rattle off what we have. She interrupts me. 
“No, no, what do *you* have? I want however many you’ll give me for this” and she put like 2 dollars on the counter. 

That’s when it hit me. You see she has this kind of notoriety that goes with why I said she’s not a typical regular. She comes in every day but she rarely buys from the store. She will instead buy smokes from whoever is working, like buy a cigarette from their pack. 

I have to explain her that I don’t smoke. I didn’t have any coworker at the moment either since he had to duck out for a few minutes. She didn’t believe me because apparently no one in their 20s *doesnt smoke* and continued to ask and then demand I sell her one of the cigarettes from my own nonexistent pack. She didn’t want to spend 8-9 dollars on her own pack and was absolutely positive she had seen me smoking in front of the store before. 

I had a line forming behind her, a long one, and I just gave up and told her that I don’t smoke and if I did I had no reason to sell her my own personal stuff. If she would like some smokes she could buy a pack, otherwise I needed her to leave the line as I had other customers waiting. 


Wasn’t happy but she left. Still comes in nearly daily and buys smokes off my coworker or from other customers now. Still insists I smoke and was being a bad employee by not selling her my own cigs.",0,1627167704

932,"""That's not good enough.""","It's store policy to leave (non purse) bags and other stores shopping upfront so there is less chance for you to slip something in them and steal. We have cameras but honestly if you place them in various places we allow, noone steals your item. Granted a lot of people still bring big enough bags, but it seems like they are purses or for their babies and other stores shopping w/o a care in the world. We only find out about it when they are checking out.

Granted this customer did not know the cashier was new, but still she hadn't been taught this fully yet.

He leaves under $10 worth of a Dollar store worth of items on her till where customers bag there stuff. Granted, it's in a yellow bag vs our white bags. Still, somehow by the time he comes back from shopping in our store, it's gone. We try and locate it (maybe one of us moved it to where it belongs). NOPE. Then, I was told to come and talk (I wasn't even in the area yet), I had first thought it was him shopping again at our store aka forgot a few things. Asked for a receipt and he tells me yeah I have it and shows me the dollar store receipt along with telling me I left this up here so you know I didn't steal. After I got up to speed, I tell him sorry nothing we can do. Shes new and will be taught now how to handle these requests.

That's not good enough.

 I tell him, OK I'll contact my manager and see what they say. She tells me to say all we can do is have you come back in the morning and look at the camera's.

That's not good enough. 

I then point my manager out to him so he can talk to her himself. She comes closer and tells me again, I think since he was clearly more English and She is more Spanish wants me to be translator. I tell him that again.

What's her name? You aren't doing your jobs.

We repeat we are sorry, and then we move back away. I reopen my till (lines were getting busy). He leaves after he sees we've now ignored him.

We are not responsible for keeping track of your items. That said, like I said above, we don't have an issue, provided you keep it away from people in a rush to get home. Also, I know people are in different situations, but $10 of $1 store items, should not be ""Not good enough"" lets' cause a scene over it.",0,1627107824
933,Customer: It's not my problem.,"NOTE: I did not check to be 100% sure, but I'm quite sure it's pretty obvious that even if true customer still was in the wrong and should have known that was the case.

The workers at the Bakery try to leave at 9pm (store closes at 10pm), they might be there cleaning and still willing to create an order for you, but basically, save for mass manufactured baked goods and the 6 pack of min bollios singles and regular sized bollios as well, there is no more to be gotten.

In particular, we have various Mexican doughnuts/cookies/cakes etc on trays you see at bakeries, which are behind glass doors, which if they did their job right have a ""plastic"" bag covering over them. Which makes it beyond obvious that they aren't accessible right now. I can't vouch if we have a sign up (but as established customers don't read).

It's very close to 10pm, I see this guy has 7 cupcakes and 1 half gallon of milk. Quick side note: I counted them, he initially was trying to get me to agree to 6. Then he ""jokingly"" said 10 20 100. I now am saying no there's 7. Also, you shouldn't have these as these are inaccessible right now after 9pm. He says not my problem. I just diffuse the situation by agreeing and saying that I will make sure they are reminded.

I was in the area just a few minutes earlier and had to tell a couple sorry bakery is closed after they asked. It's so rare that anyone tries to get any themselves. I mean, there have been times they don't put the bag over all 6, but even then, customers realize that it's closed. I don't even know if this customer found tongs or not. I hope so. At least it was cupcakes and probably all of them.

It wasn't just the words, but the way he said it and his demeanor afterwords. At least he thanked me in an unexpected tone that I bagged his groceries. And we were able to say have a good night.",0,1627103665
934,Kids get on my nerves sometimes,"Hello! This is my first post on this sub! Today was very eventful, but I'll just share this particular story.
I'm a formal childcare worker. I LOVE working with kids, and that's no secret. But today the universe decided to test me.

I (19M) work at one of those stores where everything is pretty cheap but there's really good variety in products. I was doing my business on register when suddenly I hear a weird buzzy-beepy kinda noise, far off in the store. 
I look to my coworker on the other register and we both make confused faces and shrug. A few minutes later it's still going and she asks me what that is. I say ""Maybe it's the emergency exit."" She says that probably it, and goes to check it out.

She comes back and says yeah someone pushed open the emergency exit door, and nobody here has the key to make it shut up.

So we suffer.

Cue me apologizing for the noise to every customer I have to ring up and explaining that someone opened the emergency exit and we can't turn it off, so sorry ma'am.

Then a family comes up to my register, and this kid (young, but definitely old enough to know better) points out the noise and says ""Haha that was me! It was an accident though."" His mom says that he wanted to open it because he thought something was back there and wanted to go see it. (So it, therefore, was not an accident.)
This is fine. No problem, I understand curiosity.

But then--

This kid starts spinning the bagging station around while I'm trying to bag things, whining to his mom the whole time about how he wants to go home and she's taking so long. 
I keep trying to bag things but he won't stop spinning it, so I just start scanning things and setting them to the side on my station instead of attempting to bag them. His mom tells him to cut it off and that I'm trying to do my job.

Then he starts complaining about how he wants his toy and he wants it now. His mom says that I probably already bagged it, and then he accuses me of hiding it from him for some reason??
Then he complains that some of our balloons are all the way up on the ceiling and shouldn't they be down lower, how will we get them down blah blah blah so I give my classic kid banter of ""Hey if someone was really really tall they could just jump up and grab it!""
Kid laughs, I feel accomplished.

He doesn't help his mom put her bags in the cart, but he leaves, and that's what matters.

I was working behind the seafood counter and I had a customer walk up to me. I mean everything seemed normal and all up till he opened his mouth. With a complete serious and straight face he pointed at the raw shrimp we had on display (mind you there are signs that label the product right in front of each product) and asked ""Is this raw shrimp fully cooked?""

I was completely caught off guard cause I did not expect a question so stupid. I mean if he thought about the question before asking it he would have know the answer. Completely restraining myself feom making a snarky reply I answered "" No sir, the Raw shrimp is not cooked, it is raw.""

And the customer seemed a bit shocked for a moment. Almost like they never heard of raw shrimp before? Im not exactly sure what was going on in their mind. However then they move in front of our cooked shrimp display. Pointing to it he proceeded to ask, ""Is this cooked shrimp fully cooked?""  And again I was surprised this felt like he had to ask as again there are signs in front of each produxt labeling it.

""Yes the cooked shrimp is cooked,"" I told them, and they proceeded to order a pound ( US weight) of the cooked shrimp. It was overall a bit strange.

942,I had a breakdown in front of customers after being forced to work during a power outage,"I used to work at a small grocery store in a very tourism driven town. At the store I worked a shift with what we called the ‘Zillennial Crew’, because literally all of us, including the manager, are under the age of 24. Earlier this week someone hit an electric pole with their car and knocked out the power for almost the entire town. This happened at about 5 pm which is two and a half hours before the store closes. The store’s backup generator kept things alive for about ten minutes, then everything went kaput. Everything except one check stand, at least. We think it had some kind of battery back up. Only half of it was working though: the cashier screen with the buttons, the cash drawer, and the receipt printer. No barcode scanner, no produce scale, no card reader. When the manager called the big boss (who was actually very mad at the manger for calling because it interrupted his golf session) he was told and I quote: “Since you still have a working check stand, you need to keep the store open until at least 6.” Needless to say, myself and the rest of the crew weren’t too happy about that, but the big boss threatened to fire us if we didn’t, so we tried to make the best of it. Since I’d been assigned to the half working check stand before the outage and the manager didn’t have a key to open the other cash drawers, I was going to have to check.

After some brainstorming with the manager, I figure out how to manually put in grocery items and the rest of the crew man the automatic doors and search for flashlights. The set up was something like this: 
- 2 people at the doors informing people of what was happening.
- Customers without cash were immediately turned away.
- Customers were advised to have some form of light to navigate the store but we did have a few spare flashlights they could borrow.
- Customers told to not open freezer/cooler doors until they were ready to make their selection.
- Customers told to take a picture of every item’s price tag and show the pictures to me.

I did that for an hour. On top of all that craziness, there were about a dozen alarms going off across the store because none of the coolers were on (a system meant to help ID if a cooler has stopped working, but not very helpful during a power outage). So there were a dozen or so loud, blaring, shrill beeps going off almost constantly. The entire hour. 6 o’clock finally comes around, and right on cue, my check stand dies. 

I immediately break down crying. I cannot form words. The crew explained to the customers and convince them to put their items back (everyone got really pissy because ‘it was just working a second ago’). I have to sit down and try to collect myself. One of the crew sits with me trying to help me with some relaxing breathing. One of the customers decided to be snotty on their way out and said something like “Tell that fat stupid bitch to stand up and stop crying.” They were forcibly escorted out by the manager and one of the burliest crew members. Manager calls big boss, tells him we’re closing. Other workers sweep a bit and we all leave.

I ended up quitting a few days later, but  the whole situation still makes me mad.",0,1627076013

Lottery Man: Could you check and replay these for me?

Me: Sure no problem. 

*He wins a couple bucks and I print the tickets. They are sitting in the lottery printer.*

Me: That'll be seven dollars today please.

*LM hands me a ten dollar bill*

LM (immediately after handing me the ten dollar bill): And I'd like to grab a couple tickets if I could.

*This is normal to me. People often pay a few times for different rounds of tickets or scratchers instead of on a single bill. Annoying sure, but I do it all the time.*

Me: Sure I can grab you a couple more tickets. What did you have in mind? *I glance to the scratchers under the plexiglass on the counter. The $10 is still in my hand and I'm reaching to the register to punch it in.*

LM: The tickets that you just printed off that I just purchased from you. *He reaches over the barrier and points at the tickets in the printer.*

Me (Realizing he's being condescending. I usually drop my friendly tone whenever a customer does this.): Oh, uh, yup that's usually how this works.

*I go to punch it in and get his change.*

LM: I know that's how this works, do you think I was born yesterday?

*I stop and look at him again. Then for the third time I go to punch it in and get his change.  I hand him his change then his tickets.  The way I've been selling lottery for 3 years now.*

LM: Good luck. *Scoffs, shakes his head and walks away.*

Our store is a little late on everything (cloth masks came in the day after it was decided only surgical masks were allowed, football merch came in 2 days after our team lost during EM, etc) so I told her we expect them in October.

Her: No, they're usually through at the end of August. (Looking back I'm guessing she meant sold out)

Me, deciding not to argue about which one of us has a list of incoming items for the year: Well, then you should come check back with us at the end of August. 

Her: No, they'll be sold out by then.

Me: Then you should come check back with us in the middle of August.

She then stormed off and on her way out complained: I've asked in at least ten stores now and noone can give me an answer.

Well, maybe if you didn't act like you know better than the people who work there you'd have had your answer at store #1.",0,1626985608
955,An old lady walking off without paying - Probably the oldest shoplifter!,"I was on tills at a neighborhood grocery store.  Around noon, an old lady came with a large basketful of groceries.  I scanned them all and placed them on the left-hand side of the till.  I always place unscanned items on the right desk and the scanned item on the right.

&amp;#x200B;

While scanning, I asked for her membership card, which she presented.  After I scanned, I asked, ""Would that be cash or card?""

&amp;#x200B;

The lady probably didn't hear me and started packing her item.  I asked her three times, staring in slight bemusement to the next customer.

&amp;#x200B;

Then to my surprise, she started walking off with the groceries!  I pressed on my headset to ask how I should respond.  And my manager said, ""Stop her!""

&amp;#x200B;

I left the till to try to stop her, but my manager was faster.  After pointing from fair to confirm whether the lady near the door was the one that hadn't paid, he said to the lady, ""My colleague is waiting for you to pay for your stuff.""

&amp;#x200B;

She returned to the till and paid for her items.  When she left, I deducted her grocery from her points since she had enough points to pay for most of the items.  I think it was about £0.20 remaining that she needed to pay.  I did it to try to minimize the loss of the store.",0,1626955139

In Canada, our bills are stupid, not only do they get stuck together all the time, but the 5s and 10s are blue and purple and the 20s, 50s, 100s are green red and brown so its a problem for me being colourblind but I just look at the number and its a big deal.

Last night I was working cash at the local grocery store when a lady maybe in her 30s comes through with an order that was 4.95 and she hands me a single bill which was one of the bigger bills so I punch 20.00 into the machine hand her the change. This is where weirdness begins

Her : ""I handed you a 50""

Me : ""Oh jeez im sorry""

I pressed my open till button and sure enough there was a 50 where the 20 should be so I fix her change and hand it back.

959,Dude getting angry over Watermelon,"I stock produce at a grocery store near me. I was on break when I hear over the intercom, ""Customer assistance in produce!"" I walk over to see an old man who needed help. He said that the watermelon bin was all bad. I explained that we just got this in yesterday so they couldn't all be bad. He explained that he worked produce for 28 years which I felt was a bit snobby but whatever. 



I go to the back and ask our fruit chopping guy, ""Do you still need this bin or are you almost done making watermelon chunks?"" He says he still needed it so I explained the situation to him to which he said ""Well these watermelons look worse than the ones out there. He won't like them.""





 I took his word for it since he knows more than me so I went to the customer and explained that I couldn't bring a second bin out since one of our employees had to make watermelon chunks. For some reason even though I explained why he needed them, he asked why again. Then I said he insisted that the ones out here were better than the ones in the back. He goes ""Why does he think I wouldn't like any of them?""




 I started getting a little frustrated since it seemed like there was no pleasing him so I said ""Sir, if you want to go in the back and pick your own watermelon then you can."" He refused which I felt was rude since I thought my offer was reasonable. He ended up leaving angry. I feel like he just kinda cornered us both into an unwinnable situation.",0,1626900988
960,"People Like A Helpful Person, I Guess?","I work at a grocery store where, as a bagger/stocker, sometimes I help people take groceries to there cars. I don't mind doing so because I like taking a breather before going back to work. I never expected anything in return.

A few days ago, a woman I've helped a few times (Let's just call her Mrs. Smith) stopped me before I went back inside. She gave me $20.

I told her I couldn't accept it because I didn't do that much to help her, and she might need it for something later on. She looked a bit sad...

Mrs. Smith: ""Honey, I've been shopping here every Thursday afternoon since this store opened. I've met so many employees over the past few years, but none...NONE...have offered to help me load groceries into my car. The cashier usually asks, then if I say yes, the bagger looks annoyed and does a rushed job. I've had crushed bread, broken eggs, and one even stole some sandwich meat from me. However, I've heard you ask every customer if they need help to their cars. Usually they say no, but you at least offer. Take this as a thank you from us old folk and back pay tips from the past few trips. At least let me do this for you. I know this job probably doesn't pay well right now.""

I... didn't know what to say. She stuffed the $20 in my shirt pocket, patted my chest, and walked to the front of her car. As she got in, she asked me how much the job pays and why I'm here.

Me: ""$8.25 an hour, but it'll be $10 by the end of the year. I'm getting my own apartment soon, saving up for a car, and my hobbies cost a pretty penny sometimes. I take every hour I can get.""

She nodded, said to have a good day, and drove off. When I got my new schedule for this week, I was working every day but Saturday. This was odd, so I asked my manager if something went wrong or if someone quit. He said no.

Manager: ""Make sure your apartment is always clean, show me your car when you get it, and if your hobbies are expensive from time to time, let me know when you need more hours to afford them.""

Mrs. Smith asked my manager to give me more hours. I almost cried. I never expected anything in return. I just wanted to save money so I can move out of mom's boyfriend's house and get my life together. Now, that might be easier.

961,You’re Kinda Holding Up The Line Right Now.......,"So I currently work at a popular clothing store and this happened about two or three weeks ago. It was a Saturday, and most of y’all know that Saturdays are busy as it’s the weekend, I was ringing and the line was fairly long. My manager had to call up additional associates to the register to keep the line going.

So here’s where it starts, these two ladies come up with this pair of shoes and they ask me to check if they have it in a specific size, and I tell them that what we have out is all we have. They then ask me to see if another nearby location has it, and they do, so they asked me if I could call up that store to put those shoes on hold for them. I had never been asked to call another store so I asked my boss, and she told me to call the store later and go back to ringing as the line was still pretty long. 

I told the two ladies that I’ll call up the store later as my manager asked me to continue ringing up customers as the line was busy. One of the ladies was like, “no, I’ve worked in retail, and we’re still customers” basically explaining that I should make the call now. I didn’t wanna seem rude as my boss specifically asked me to make the call later, so I motioned to my boss that I needed her, so she came over and explained to them that we can’t put items at other stores on hold (as that’s the other store’s responsibility). After some back and forth, my manager had me call the other store, but expressed doubts of them answering. Surely enough, they didn’t answer and I let the customers know, so I gave them the store number and the sku number of the item. After they left I went back to ringing.

When it comes to looking up items, it’s best to just ask an associate who isn’t at the register to look it up, because when you fall in line to do so, you could be holding up the line.",0,1626876427

Always recommend that everyone should work retail at least once in their life so we can live in a nicer world but oh well. 

After a very stressful and long late shift I was so glad to finally go home. Two minutes before closing two women come in. We are obviously preparing to close in a matter of minutes. One of them proclaims that she only needs milk and is running towards the isle, the other one takes her sweet ass time looking for stuff to fill in her basket. When both of them finally come to the register after closing, the first woman doesn’t only have milk, she had half the store in her basket and I was impressed how fast she must have grabbed all these things. The second woman has like 15 items and wants me to do three different totals for I don’t even know why. I get it if you want to split your stuff for another person, your office etc. But three totals? After closing time? Don’t you feel a tiny bit embarrassed at least? Also she has exactly three coupons for every one of her purchases and she is making damn sure that I don’t forget scanning them.

This happened in Queensland, Australia

A woman has been arrested after allegedly attacking a Myer staff member with a box cutter when she was asked to wait for service on the Gold Coast.

Police said the woman approached the counter as a staff member was on the phone at the Robina Town Centre this morning, and was told she'd be served shortly.
The waiting woman then allegedly pulled out a blade believed to be a box cutter from her handbag and attacked the 32-year-old employee, slicing her right hand.

Manager cleans up the water while I cleaned up the glass. As I’m sweeping I found the water bottle they completely poured out and a chewed up piece of gum on the ground. I can still actively hear these kids running around and while I swept I found their guardian. She then proceeded to call them through the store telling them they needed to go before they break anything. I proceeded to tell her that they actually already broke something but it was okay cause we already cleaned it up. Had these kids just broke that thing and told us that would’ve been fine but seeing that they were just running around doing WHATEVER and didn’t feel the need to tell a worker what happened I figured I’d snitch. I walked away and she found them and all I heard was her telling them a bunch how she found out what they did and that they were in trouble. As they were checking out the kids were both actively wearing hats (our merchandise) and threw 2 tutus on the ground for us to put away.

966,Why third shift is the best shift…,"I graduated college and got a new job… real career move. But I miss my job as a third shift cashier at a convenience store. Here’s why…

Third shift is when all the action took place. Whenever the cops were called, it was during my shift. Usually it was the drunk couples on their way home from the swingers club up the road. They’d come into the store and start really random fights with each other. They always tried to involve me and get me to choose a side, but I just told them I was there for the show and to be on standby in case things went too far. 

Weekends were the best because we got the drunks AND the stoned people AND the drunk stoned people. They are actually really funny, and easy to get along with. The only thing I hated was when a drunk person drove themselves, and I’d have to pull the emergency switch to shut down all of the gas pumps. It was amusing to see them on camera as they tried to figure out what was happening. It sucked to call the police on them, but we had to. We couldn’t just let them drive home. The cops told me they usually just escort them home, give them a ticket, and tell them they’ll go to jail if they do it again. I hope that’s true. 

When I’d have class during the day on a Friday then go to third shift that night, I’d be in a weird tired state that would get really amusing to me and my coworker. I remember one night somebody ordered a dangerous amount of fries. I dropped them in the fryer and started laughing my ass off. I was bent over, tears in my eyes, needing the bathroom kind of laughing. My coworker rushed over, thinking something  was wrong. Between my laughs, I managed to explain that when I dropped the fries in the fryer, I swore I heard the potatoes screaming as they went down. 

Time flies by on third shift. In our factory town, we would get a huge surge of factory workers at 4:30 am who were coming in for their breakfast before work. It was really rewarding to have conversations and get to know them as people. They often told us that we helped them get their day off on the right foot. 

Most importantly, my boss worked first shift. So I’d be out of there right as she came in. Never had to work with her. 

I worked with only one other person, so we had a very interesting friendship. Together, we got to experience these things and still look back at them fondly. 

Any fellow retail workers agree? Disagree? Maybe just a funny story? Sometimes I think about going back just for the heck of it, but retail is hard work. I often say that everybody should work retail once in their lives.

967,I wrote this review for a customer service agent from Skyscanner.,"Preamble for Reddit: Customer service is difficult, frustrating. Often with no growth. For this one case, I wanted a write a glorious review. I hope it gets the agent a bonus, a promotion, or simply make her day. So I wrote this, and I meant all of it.

I faced a rare situation - I booked my flight through a rather unknown agent (Gotogate) and I couldn't board my flight due to lack of a transit visa that I was not aware of. The airline assured me that I can get a refund, but I can only get it via Gotogate. Gotogate was unresponsive, unreachable;  I also found several hundreds of cases on facebook and twitter where people alleged that Gotogate didn't refund them. Some of these cases alleged that they hadn't got their refunds for more than a year!

I had given up hope for even a reply from them, let alone getting my money back. I had given up, blaming it on sheer bad luck.

Then, Skyscanner and mainly, Michele happened. A sheer stroke of luck. Michele not only put me in touch with Gotogate, she was the patient mediator and a pillar of support for over 2 months. I've worked in customer service myself, and I have not seen anyone hold their patience for 2+ months. But Michele did.

Because she was there, I trusted and felt confident that I could indeed get my money back. I'm a student, and 1900 euros is a big deal to me. Michele provided transparency, consistency and most importantly I could trust her - I had faith that its possible. I could relax and think ""She'll do her thing and make it work"". At the end of every message she'd write ""I'm always there"". 

I'm very grateful for the support she provided - it was an unparalleled and a unique experience to completely trust someone I have never met, but I believed it was possible because she was there all the time, whenever I wrote an email.

I'm grateful and lucky to have her assigned as the agent on this issue.

Many thanks to Michele, and Skyscanner.",0,1626832319

We make several announcements(15 minutes to closing, 10 minutes to closing, 5 minutes to closing, final one at 11pm to say store is closed). After paging the store to say the store is closed at 11pm, we wait for that idiot to come up so we can ring her stuff up and everyone can go home. We waited for like 10 minutes and when we walked by each isle, we saw her on the wine aisle still yapping away with a few items in her arms. When we informed her that the store had been closed at 11, she was like no no let me finish my phone call first. We were nice enough to let her do that, and 10 minutes later, we walk up to her again and let her know that it is time to checkout so everyone can go home. We were about to page for the manager on duty to come up to the front and he would have loved to tell her off. Anyways, she comes up 5 minutes later, still yapping on her phone.

I clench my jaw to not say anything stupid, and inform her that she needs to swipe her card on the machine. She puts her phone down and tells me, ""don't play dumb with me"", then immediately goes back to yapping on her phone. Wow, really lady?

970,I just want gold!!!,"I work at a pretty small hardware store. I work best in mixing paint, and I also have a background in art so I’m pretty good with colors. I usually love helping customers with picking a color because most of the time, my customers respect my input and come back happy with the result. Last week I had the opposite. This is how the conversation went; 

[WL- weird lady 
M- me ] 

WL: “Can you make me a gold color like this?”

She holds up a can of Rustoleum metallic paint, which is very shiny and not flat at all.

M: “I’m sorry miss but we only do flat colors, we just are unable to mix any metallics in the wall paints. “

WL: “I didn’t say I wanted metallic! I just want a gold color!”

M: *is taken aback* “uh, well you can look at our color samples and see what’s closest to that gold?”

WL: “i want you to help me find a color close to it because it’s your job.”

at this point I’m just wanting to get the color made and boot her to the register. So I start looking at colors and suggesting some for her, she shoots every one down. 

M: “I think this is the closest I can find to the can you showed me”

WL: I don’t want what the can is! I want gold!

M: *?????* “….ok, so you want something a bit more on the warm yellowish side?”

WL: “I’ve already said I wanted gold a million times!”

M: *visibly frustrated* “can you show me roughly what you mean when you say you want gold?” 
 
WL: *picks out literally a very yellow shade and flicks it at me*

M: “is this the color you want then?”

WL: “yes, it’s the closest thing you have to gold.” [it really isn’t but art is subjective so whatever]

M: *makes her the sample as she watches closely, she sees me put in literally the exact name and sample she handed me. I put a dot of paint on top of the can and hand it to her.*

“Anything else I can help you with?”

WL: *inspects the top of the can for ten seconds* 
“This is not gold.” 

M: “Ma’am you chose that color yourself.”

WL: “yes but this is not gold.”

M: “but the paint is going to look exactly the same as the sample you provided.” 

WL: “I don’t care that it’s the same! It’s the wrong color!” 

M: “well you’re the one who picked it, so it’s not my fault if you don’t think you picked the right color. I will make you another one if you can find a sample you are sure you want.”

WL: *scoffs and looks at the colors a little bit longer, before handing me a slightly darker sample*

M: “are you sure this is the color you want? The paint is going to be exactly the same color and sheen of this sample.”

WL: “yes, yes I’m sure. Just make my paint so I can get out of here already.”

M: *same process, sample is done* 

WL: *inspects it again*
“This isn’t the right color.”

M: *finally snaps* 
“Ma’am, I asked you if this is the color you wanted, you said yes, twice. I told you the color will look EXACTLY like the sample, what on earth could possibly be wrong with this sample?” 

WL: “it’s not the same as the sample, it’s too yellow!” 

M: *opens the can, dots the sample paper with the paint, and dries it, right in front of her. It blends in perfectly as it should*

WL: *silence*

M: “I’m not wasting any more paint or time. Either take the paint or leave.”

WL: *grumbles and pays for the paint up front*

Today I had a customer leave a public comment on our public social media saying she was over charged for an item we had advertised at discounted price

Now I had been in the store all morning, I asked my employees if this had happened. I checked the register. Didn’t find any record of transaction.

I replied letting her know she may have went to the wrong store as our price is x and there is a similar store down the road with the same item at the price she paid

She was positive she was at our store

I called asked for more info and told her I would call her back

1 - she was here this morning said there was a female employee working outside with long hair

We have no female employee working outside today. We have a large man with short hair working outside.

2- it was busy and she walked into the front door at 11pm

We had a new fridge get stuck in our front door for starting at 830 until 12
We had some customers using the back door but most people didn’t come in. Was a very slow day for customers.

3- there was a person putting air in their tire in parking lot

I decided to check the cameras, didn’t see that
Didn’t see an older lady purchase specific item any time this morning since we opened

So I called her back. I apologized and told her I didn’t want to offend her but I checked the cameras, sales receipts, and based off the info she gave us she wasn’t here at our store (in a gentle way)

She wasn’t happy obviously, said she had been here before 

I’m 100% positive she wasn’t at my store. I have no problem fixing mistakes and owning up to them. But this wasn’t our mistake. I didn’t want to tell her my findings I knew she wouldn’t believe me anyways. I knew she would be mad.

I needed to tell her my findings incase it escalated on social media, I have all the back up I need to know and post back If she leaves a bad review.

979,The time an angry customer was 1000% right but it’s wasn’t our fault,"So this story begins in a “lovely” store that rhymes with ballmart. At this point in time I had worked there for about 8 months in the electronics section. As some of you might know stores like to move product around for seemingly no reason and this was one of those times. 

We were moving our movie sections around. Think comedy moving to the thriller section and kids movies moved to another location. Either way this was a long annoying and somewhat pointless process. 

Now I would help wherever but our queen of movies (as I used to call her) is W. She was amazing and the fastest even though at this point she was a great grandma and one of the sweetest people I have ever had the joy to work with. 

Well during this large scale re-arrange one particular movie was placed in its new home. The movie in question was Roots and it’s new home still had old signs (we were waiting for the replacements to come on the midnight truck) that read “comedies”.

We had one customer notice this and this gentleman was very very VERY angry. I do not blame him it’s completely understandable. However one would expect that seeing empty shelves and boxes full of movies all over the department that he would realize that we were not going to leave the movie there. 

Now Ms. W was a kind woman and 90% of the time she could have a customer laughing by the time they left even if they were screaming when they came in. Well this customer took her southern accent to mean that she purposely placed the movie there and was racist herself. 

At this point the customer is stepping closer to poor W and once I finished ringing out my customer I called for my manager H And went over to try and calm the guy down and to put some distance between him and W. Now in my area we aren’t super diverse regarding ethnicity. H was our only African American manager at the time. 

Once H finally arrived he pulled W aside to assess the situation and mr customer was bashing me the entire time. I mostly just agreed with him and kept trying to explain what was happening and why it was there. I even showed him where the movies would be and that the signs would be changed that night once they were delivered. 

H finally takes over. W goes to the back to collect herself and I helped the rubber-necking customers that were in the area. H finally got the customer calm enough to listen to reason and ended up giving him a movie for free for the trouble.

W went to the customer after the fact to make sure he didn’t actually think she was racist. (She had tears in her eyes because she didn’t want him to think she was racist). And he just walked away completely giving her the cold shoulder.

On my next break I bought W a coke and her favorite candy. I reminded her that she isn’t what one person says and she knows who she is and everyone that matters knows what kind of person she is and that’s what matters.",0,1626752428

983,Disrespect for your granddaughters pants?,"Aight, just happened, and I am so lucky management here is friendly and relatively lax. 

So I work at Roos embellish for reduced. And at the counter you really get to see the people in the store. And to day I found quite the jem of a woman. 

I do the formals, 'hi' 'you find what you need?' and she was fine. After that she was talking with her daughter about changing the granddaughter's hair style and I just did the fastest I can do to keep my CPR up best I could. I happen to over stuff the first bag, I'm a person that trust for everything in one trip since we can't take the carts out, and she sees the pants I just put down and gets huffy.

She had the audacity to cause me of disrespectfully treating her cloths lol like trash, and not following protocol and folding them. And her I am standing there with the last two bits she's buying thinking that for the near half a year I've been around ain't nobody had a problem before.

Also, we do t have a folding policy sinc the policy is to NOT fold.

She does the thing, ask for manager, and I call. Yet today, everyone had the walkies just on our hips. No ear piece. So when I asked for them, and they of course ask why, about three random people heard me say l, and I quote, ""A ma'am is not happy with how I presented her cloths in her bag"" 

She then proceeded to scream at manager when she got there about me announcing it to the whole store. And about me, me, causing a scene. I will tell you now. More heads turned when she voiced h r complaint than the time one of my coworkers said fuck on the actual intercoms.

Anyway, after she left literally everyone is asking me if I'm okay. And I'm just on a 15 now (actually timed that way surprise surprise) so I can let anyone who wants to know, know. 

Best bit is she asked for Corp number. We don't HAVE one.",0,1626732156

986,The day I thought I was going to be robbed.,"I managed a country convenience store and knew most of my regular customers. One day this guy I didn't know comes in and stands in the doorway. We had a vestibule with in and out doors then the main entrance with in and out doors. He was standing in the main entrance ""in"" door. He just stopped and was looking around the store. He was tall, so he had a pretty good view. At the time, I had one other customer in the store. The guy just stands there looking around though. I'm actually not sure if I greeted him or not as the door is down the wall from where the cash register is. My internal alarm hadn't gone off yet, but I wondered what he was up too. This was in the 1980's so the only phone was hanging on the wall by the cash register. Eventually, the woman that was shopping came up and I checked her out. Again, he hadn't moved yet. Then, as she's leaving the store, the man goes over to the ""out"" door and watched her all the way to her vehicle. Now, my hackles are up. Yup, I'm getting robbed. I was the only other person in the store. After she is gone, the man turns around and comes to the counter. I'm thinking to myself, ""just hand over the money and everything will be alright"". He comes to the counter and says ""nice store"". ""Thanks"" I said. He then goes to the back and picks up a few things. He picks up an extra 7up and offers it to me. 

Turns out he had just moved into the neighborhood and this was his first time in the store. He was a good customer for a few months until he moved away. One thing he did though, he always picked up something extra and offered it to me.",0,1626719797

Personally, I can barely see their body through the case and all the seafood piled in it, let alone which specific tiny thing they are pointing at.

So she goes around and the woman is pointing so coworker opens the case from the front and goes to grab the desired claw.  The woman says ""oh!  What are these big cooked shrimp here?""  and STARTS PICKING THEM UP WITH HER BARE HANDS, inspecting them and putting them back.  My loud coworker says ""YOU CANT TOUCH THE SHRIMP!""

989,"Sorry lady, I don’t control taxes","Yesterday I was at the register at the shoe store I work at and this woman brought in a pair of shoes that she wanted to exchange for a bigger size. Ok, no problem. I ask her for the receipt and she says she lost it. Again, not a problem. I ask her for her drivers license as per our no receipt return policy, she gives it to me, and I manually input the price of the shoes she was returning.

I scan the pair that she wanted to buy, and the difference is $2.19 because of taxes. She seemed confused, so I explained to her that we can’t do an even exchange because of taxes. She replies with “but I live in (neighboring county) and the taxes are the same there”.

I explain to her that the tax is dependent on where she bought the shoes (my store is part of a large chain with locations all over the country), and since we don’t have the receipt, we can’t verify whether or not she paid tax because we don’t know which store she purchased them from. Therefore, we could only refund her the listed price of the shoes, and she would still have to pay tax because my location taxes every purchase. I told her that I was very sorry for the confusion but I had no control over this. She proceeded to say “the 2 dollars isn’t the problem, you’re the problem.”

At this point I was both shocked and pissed off, and I asked her what I did wrong. I don’t remember exactly what she said, but I think it was something along the lines of “I live in (neighboring county) where taxes are the same”.
I continued to try and explain that where she lives has nothing to do with how much she gets taxed, and that I also have no say in the matter and there was nothing I could do. She inserted her card but continued to rant about how I was the problem. I’m not perfect at my job but I’m pretty sure I’m very much not the problem in this case lol",0,1626707022

993,Called an idiot because I was doing my job,"I work at a convenience store, and there are so many times where a customer comes in, gets 10 dollars worth of items and pats with a hundred dollar bill.

Now we can never keep enough change in the tills for something like that as a robbery prevention, as most don't want a bunch of 5 dollar bills and coins. So we ask if they have anything smaller or if they can pay with card, if not we inform them that we must take money out of the safe, and that it will take two minutes if the change is over 50 dollars as we can only take out 40 dollars at a time and must wait 2 minutes for the next tube of bills.

Some get mad, but most understand, but the one I had to deal with was another story.

It was the end of a shift and I had to count the money in the tills and and all the tubes of money in the safe, that means no tubes can go in or out until I finish counting, meanwhile my coworker helped the customers.

So a guy came in and bought I say 15 dollars worth and brought out a 100 dollar bill, now at that point we had no large bills as they were all in the safe, so my coworker asked the usual questions, and then I informed him that because I am counting the money, it will be a longer wait until I count the safe.  So he got angry saying that. He couldn't wait and that his drinks would melt, he bought slushies.

I told him that he didn't have to wait long as I was almost finished, but that was still to long and said that ""I will take a drink from this slushie and leaving"" 

I apologized saying that it is a robbery prevention to not keep large bills in the till and that we couldn't take money out of the aafe while I was counting, his only response was ""no you are an idiot for not knowing how to do your job"" and left.

The thing is, it would have added an extra 2 minutes to him waiting so we could get him all his change.  No idea if he was in a rush, but so many times I can't help but ask myself ""why couldn't thet go to the bank to get smaller bills, and why so thet think convenience stores just have the money ready for them?""",0,1626668300
994,"“You’re cute. I have a crush on you,” said the stranger","I have no idea who this kid is, but he was around my age, maybe a tiny bit older, but definitely not by much. I’ve only just started working at a store just down the street from my house (it’s my 5th working day there) and it’s my very first job. 

I’m a cashier. I get to meet nice people, hear about their day, and then wish them a good rest of their day. However, this kid was different. 

He was with his buddy, and while I knew they were young and likely didn’t care about anything I had to say, I still greeted them with my usual cheery, “Hello! How’s your day been?” I asked if they wanted a bag, and scanned their three items. 

The kid was really bad at pronouncing his words, so I could hardly understand what he was saying, but nonetheless I carried on a small conversation until I had everything ready to be paid for. He gave me the money and I gave him his change. He began to walk backwards with a dumb grin on his face and he says, “You’re cute.” I at first didn’t hear what he said and thought he said “you’re chill” but asked him to repeat it anyway. I then heard “you’re cute. I have a crush on you.” He’s no younger than 17. I gave an awkward smile and told him to have a good day, just so I could get the interaction over with. His buddy laughed and I could tell he was teasing his friend. I brushed off the weird comment and continued on with the next guest. 

About 15-25 minutes later, the kid comes back and pulls an icebreaker from the shelf that’s connected to my checkout lane. It was clearly something he grabbed just so he had an excuse to be there. He then asks me for my Snapchat. I told him I didn’t have a Snapchat. He asked for any other socials, and I told him I wasn’t allowed to give it out. I don’t know if that’s genuinely true, but I really didn’t want to give him anything that he could use to find me on social media. He asked me my name. I did give him that since I don’t have a name tag because I’m new and my name is almost impossible to spell without help despite it being only 4 letters. I continued to scan his item and get everything over with. I, again, wished him a good day and kept my cool, despite internally freaking out. 

Thank god he didn’t come back. I don’t know what I would’ve done if he tried again, or waited until I was on my break. Even if he came back later or found out when I was off my shift, I live just down the street and he could’ve easily followed me. I might be being paranoid at this point, but it was genuinely a little scary",0,1626665866

1005,When the return policy is TOO lenient,"So back in April of this year I was working at this one retail store at a mall near my college. The return policy was that items could be returned within 90 days of purchase, it was fine if you didn’t have your receipt, and we could even bring up purchases for return through the card used in the purchase. 

Most items that got returned would be damaged out mainly if they were clearly worn or pose a risk in regards to sanitation, for example: beauty items returned always get damaged out. Regular clothing items, that don’t have visible wear don’t get damaged out though.

I’m gonna focus on a rather interesting return I had to process. So one day this woman comes in wanting to return a bra, and she didn’t have the receipt on her. I noticed the tags had been removed so I couldn’t do a no receipt return. However, we (one of my managers helped me) were able to trace the purchase through her credit card, and she was within 90 day of purchase so she was definitely eligible for return. 

She was able to get her money back of course, but I noticed some flaws in the bra when it was returned. She had clearly worn the bra, as it had pit stains and was kinda smelly. I already knew the bra had to be damaged out. As I was walking to the main register (I was ringing at a register in a separate part of the store) one of my managers asked what happened with the bra and looked disgusted, and I explained how it was clearly worn, and could no longer be sold, and another manager agreed that it had to be damaged out. So I filled out a damage tag, and tossed it in with the other damaged items.

Ultimately I don’t recommend you do what the lady who made the return did. If a store has a lenient return policy, they will likely accept items that have been washed ;).",0,1626617742

1013,Woman thinks I'm being discriminating for calling her out for cutting in line,"I work at a store that has a food court. People line up in one long line and wait to be called up to place their order from either me or another cashier. I've made it a habit to make eye contact and wave over the next customer because sometimes there is confusion on who is supposed to go next. There are times where people accidentally cut in front of others and I always tell them that they weren't the next person in line and to go back to wait their turn. Most of the time, the person is apologetic and apologizes to both me and the person they cut in front of. Other times, they get defensive, but in the end they go back to their spot in the line. Well, today was a bit different. 

I was finishing up helping a customer and called for the next customer to my window. For reference, I have two windows and my register is in the middle of both windows. A man approaches my left window and a woman approaches my right window. I knew that the man was next because I saw the woman walk straight from her spot in the line to my right  window, disregarding the man who was waiting in the front of the line. The woman speaks up first before I could tell her to go back in line. The following dialogue was translated from Spanish

Woman: Hello, two smoothies please. 

Me: I'm sorry ma'am, but were you next?

Woman: What do you mean? Of course I was next!

Me: Well, it seems that gentleman over there was next.

Woman: I was waiting in line.

A woman from the line pipes up and says, ""Yes, she was waiting in line in front of me. It's alright."" I nod my head to that woman and turn to look at the man on my left window. The man and I speak to each other in English. 

Man: It's alright, you can go ahead and help her first. 

I notice that the man was counting out his change anyway so I go to attend to the woman. She repeats her order, this time more harshly. 

Me: Before I start your order, I need to scan a membership card to ring you up.

Woman: You need a wait?

Me: Your membership card, please.

Woman: My goodness.... 

Rolling her eyes, she waves over someone from outside the line, shouting at them to hurry up with the card. I check back on my left window to see if the man was done counting his change, but he isn't. 

Man: It's alright, go ahead and help her out.

Me: Oh, I was but I'm waiting for her to bring her membership card.

Finally, a younger woman comes to the line asking what the line cutter woman needed. 

Woman: She needs to see a membership card to take my order, apparently. 

Younger woman: Oh okay, here it is.

I finally scan their card and as I'm scanning it the line cutter woman turns to the younger woman and speaks loudly so I can obviously hear.

Woman: Let's never come here again! It seems that the employees like to discriminate against certain customers.

Me: Excuse me? 

Woman: You like to discriminate against people, don't you? 

Me: I don't understand. I asked you if you were next because I saw that you weren't. I'm not discriminating you. 

She waves her hand at me and just tells me her order again. I punch it in and just decide to let it go, but she decides to keep pushing my buttons. 

Woman: I hope she gives us good service, but she probably won't. Let's not come here again.

The thing that annoyed me the most about this woman was that she wasn't looking me in the face when she said this. It's like she didn't have the balls to say it straight to me, but wanted to seem tough in front of the younger woman. I cut her off from saying anything else and ask her if that's all she wants to order. The younger woman responds for her. I walk away to put the order together and my coworker asks if I need any help. I ask her to help the kind gentleman waiting patiently in the other window while I help the line cutter woman. I then return to the window with the woman's items. 

Woman: Next time, don't discriminate against us.

Me: I wasn't being discriminatory, I asked you if you were next and you weren't yet I still attended to you. I also need a membership card from every customer, not just you. 

Woman: Whatever, just don't do it next time. 

Me: You know what? Whatever, I know what I did wasn't discriminating you. There's no point in arguing with you. NEXT PLEASE.

She walks away from my window, but not before saying one last thing before she left.

Woman: Don't discriminate!

1016,"Apparently I'm a ""B*tch""","So today was relatively slow for a Saturday at a grocery store. I was having a good day and had 3ish hrs left of my shift. Anyway this black lady, with eyes pointing in two different directions, came to my lane. She wanted to buy mushrooms and wanted to know how much was on her gift card. Now cashiers can check how much is on gift cards and EBTs, but few ask so it took me around 20 SECONDS to find where the card balance checker is on our register. (our register has 5 menus with 3 pages on each one, so it took me a while to find the correct button) However in the timespan of 5 seconds, we managed to have this conversation:

Lady: ""How much is on the card, How much is on the card, How much is on the card?""

Me(slightly and rightfully annoyed): ""just wait a couple seconds.""

Lady: ""Well you need to calm down and don't get angry!""

I found the the button and to find the amount on the gift card, I have to swipe the card on the pinpad. She had $8.31 on it and told her that. She asked how much were her mushrooms($4.39ish) and batteries($4.99ish), which went over her gift card amount. So she told me to remove the batteries and then asked how much was on the card and the mushroom price again. Then we started this conversation:

Lady: ""So am I good to leave?""

Me: ""No, you still need to pay.""

Lady: ""I thought you already swiped my card?""

Me: ""That was to find out how much was on your card.""

Lady: ""Fine. Do I least get a bag? I'm an American""

Me: ""There right there."" (by then my bagger just bagged her SINGLE item)

Lady: ""By the way I thought you should know that you a b\*tch, you a b\*tch.""

She left and the customer after her told me that the lovely lady cut in front of her and then asked if she could go in front. The ""b\*tch"" line wasn't even what annoys me, its the ""American"" line. I was born in China, but was adopted and Brough to America at the age of 3.

1027,Clever Thief Almost Got Away with $1000 Worth of Merchandise,"This happened three days ago and I'm still surprised.

I was working one of the registers on a pretty steady day. Not busy but not slow as pond water either. While I rang up a few customers, I noticed two managers (the head cashiers) talking and looking both concerned and amused. When there weren't any customers waiting, I went to satisfy my curiosity when I noticed a cart stocked with lots of expensive power tools and batteries for said tools. My first thought was a customer forgot their wallet in their car and went to get it (happens more often than you think) or a customer went to grab something else before checking out.

Welp, no such thing.

According to the head cashier (HC, 20s female) who was watching self-checkout at the time, a male customer came up to scan those items. There was another customer doing the same while the HC watched, but she noticed something while the guy was scanning things.

Now, every time something is scanned for purchase at any register, an image of it appears on the screen. The guy appeared to be scanning the power tools and batteries, but the head cashier noticed everything he had scanned on the screen didn't match the products he had. The screen showed several lines of the same small bit of PVC pipe, which was worth a buck and change, and this guy didn't have ANY PVC piping in his cart whatsoever.

The HC noticed this and quickly gathered the courage to properly approach the customer as he was nearly done. She told him, very professionally, there was an issue because he was scanning as they didn't match the image on the screen. The customer feigned ignorance while the HC proceeded to scan one of the items he ""already scanned"" and sure enough, the correct item appeared on the screen with the correct triple-digit price tag. She proceeded to remove what he scanned already and scanned every item correctly. Suddenly the customer is surprised and says he can't afford all that. The HC does the ""Do you want to save some money by signing up for the company credit card?"" bit, to which he declines and leaves empty-handed.

Turns out the guy had a little barcode sticker ON HIS FINGER for PVC and scanned it to make it seem like he was scanning the other items. If the HC hadn't paid proper attention, the dude would've walked out of the store with almost $1000 worth of merchandise. Other managers were informed of the incident and the ASMs (assistant store managers) gave the HC props for handling the situation so well.

We have some wayward youths working at our store who have a bad habit of neglecting their duties in favor of socializing with each other. This scenario should serve as a learning experience for them and future employees to be more vigilant.

1037,"No, sir. I cannot use an online code for in-store purchases.","I work in an auto shop, and recently became a manager there. My boss had warned me that the higher you go in retail, it gets harder to deal with customers. I thought he was joking because I’ve pretty much had pretty chill and downright friendly customers for the majority of my time working there.

But this one customer. Goddamn. He actually made my blood boil. I’m not a violent or angry person by any means, but he was actually testing my patience.

First he walks in the store, and shows me the product he needs on his phone. He had already visited the website, so he already knew what he was looking for. 

All right, cool. This’ll be a quick transaction. So I get the product for him, and go to my register. As I’m about to scan it, he hits me with this.

Customer: I’d like to use this code *shows me an online code on his phone*

Me: *stares at him* Are you planning to buy the product online?

Customer: No I want to use the code in here.

Me: I can’t use that code. You can only use it online.

Customer: But it’s your store. It’s the same thing, it’s your website. 

Me: I’m aware that the website and our store have the same name. But we have no control over whatever happens online. 

Customer: Where’s the manager?

Me: *giddy on the inside to finally use the quote* I am the manager. And I’m telling you, that this code is not going to work in the store.

Customer: Well why can’t you just honor it?

Me: *stares at him again* Honor what? There’s nothing to honor, because this is an online code. And you are currently in the store. In-store purchases and online purchases are completely separate things. It’s not going to work.

Customer: I didn’t see you type it in.

Me: *never taking my eyes off him, proceeds to type in the code, move the monitor so he can see it. I hit enter, and nothing happens.*

Customer: ….Well something’s wrong with your computers, because the other stores have done this for me.

Me: *almost losing my temper* There’s no way the other stores have done this. The code is supposed to be used online, so if they were to type in the computer at the store, they would’ve gotten the same result as me. Nothing.

Customer: *makes a big huff and finally goes into his email to pull up a coupon that can be used in the store.* I’ll be calling corporate about this.

Me: You do that.

I relayed the entire interaction with this guy to my boss, and he laughed his ass off, and even his boss lost it when he told him.

I’m all good now, but man, that customer was not listening to a word I said.",0,1626445242
1038,That time I kinda went off on a “customer”,"Calling him a customer is being generous, and this took place earlier this week. 

My coworker was in the restroom and I had a small line. Nothing big just three people with a few things. A fourth one skips the line to ask me if we have any more six-packs of a specific beer. I tell him I’m not sure but I can definitely check the cooler for him once I finish. He walks off and I finish the line quick, I didn’t see the guy anywhere and figured he hit the bathroom so I go ahead and dip into the cooler. 

Except when I open the cooler door, the guy walks out carrying his beers. 

Now I assume, and I genuinely hope, all of you know why that is a BIG NO NO. Customers don’t go into the back room, they don’t go into the walk in cooler. 

I try to shrug it off, retain that customer service tone and tell him that he cant go back here, if he had been patient I told him I was going to go in it and get him his beer. His response?

*”Whatever”* and an attempt to shoulder past me. 

That burned any chance he had. I told him to hand me the beer, he stared at me dumbly so I said louder and firmer that he is to hand me the beer. Then I tore into him. “Non-employees are *not* to go into the coolers. You were told to wait. Because of that you need to leave the store. Now.”

As you can guess he complained and then said he wasn’t leaving without his beer. I straight up told him as he was told to leave his refusal meant he was trespassing. I WILL be calling the police if this continues. He needs to walk his ass out the door either on his own or brought out by cops. I will not be serving him in the future and if I see him in the store on any future I will be kicking his ass out upon sight. 

Then he had the gall to claim that what I was doing wasn’t right, that **he hadn’t done anything to warrant being kicked out.** I pointedly told him that going into employee areas can and will get customers kicked out of the store. I then pointedly went to the office as it was closer to get the phone. This dude swore at me and stormed out yelling that he would call my boss and called me a bitch. 

After that I threw some carts to block the entry to the back room/coolers, and left a note for other staff that hey, people are going into the coolers. And one for the boss to please get the cooler door fixed (the handle broke clean off three weeks ago) so we can lock it.

Wtf is these ppls thought process tho, to think that hey it’s perfectly fine to  walk into the coolers?",0,1626444837
1039,I'm the new guy,"I work at an auto parts store. I'm the only guy on staff, everyone else is female. A couple weeks ago a guy in his 50s comes in.


Cast:

R- coworker

Me- well, me

C- customer 


I'm sitting at the far end of the counter having my lunch as we don't have a break room when C comes in.


R- Welcome to (store name) how can I help you?


C- Hey how are ya? No offense miss, but I'm going to talk to this guy (gesturing at me), I'm sure he'll know what I need.


Now I should mention I've only been here a few months and have very little car knowledge outside of changing my own oil, R had been here 7 years at this point and has been helping to educate me. 


R just rolls here eyes as C heads towards me. 


Me- To be honest sir, I'm the new guy. R here knows a lot more than I do.


The look on Cs face was priceless. Evidently this 50 year old man was dumbstruck that a guy in his 40s knew less about car parts that a woman in her 30s.


It's funny to me how a lot of guys will automatically assume that I'll know more that my female coworkers just because I'm a guy. Thankfully most of them have little problem when I have to pass a more technical issue on to one of the girls, they just look surprised when it happens.",0,1626434992

1046,The day the register froze,"So, idk if it’s like this at other places but the gas station I work at only keeps one register up after 9. Partly because it’s slower during the last 2 hours and partly because there’s only one person working after 9. Usually that isn’t an issue. Occasionally I’ll have people complain, or outright ignore the “register closed” signs to try and scan their items themselves cause they don’t wanna wait in line. 

A few months back while handling the last couple of customers for the night, the retail gods decided to make things harder. I only had the one register up, store closed in 5 minutes and I had a line of three. The lady and her son that I was helping was trying to buy several cases of beer. Usually no issue, so long as the parent pays for and carries said alcohol. 

Well, while she was doing this, she decided half-way through the transaction (paying via card) that she wanted to add smokes and one of our single 24oz cans of bud to the purchase. So I hit cancel, rang those up, started the transaction over, then she cancels it on her end because she didn’t think the price was right. I guess the system didn’t like it being canceled so much so quickly because after she ran her card a third time, the register outright froze. 

the system froze completely. The only thing I could do would be to completely reboot the register. Which takes 15 minutes, and by that point it was a minute until we closed. I could do nothing for her purchase on this register, and I couldn’t jump on the other register as it was down for the night, I’d have to do a shift change on it, which as a closer I was not trained to do and would not be able to do. 

I felt bad for the customers as I wouldn’t be able to help anyone/ none of the would be able to make a purchase.  Most were understanding. One of my regulars bitches a little about not being able to buy her Nattys. 

The ones at the register however insured they be able to take home the beer and smokes they bought. I explained that because the register froze it is unlikely their csrd went through and I can’t let them walk out with almost $50 with or merchandise without confirmation their card even went through. They kept insisting and so I decided screw it, here is what we will do. I had them write their name and number, and if the register unfreezes before I left and the payment went through I’ll call them so they can pick the stuff up. Otherwise morning will call them if it went through. Their card did not go through in the end. 

I felt bad and understood where they were coming from but also I don’t think there’s a store that would let you leave with that much unpaid stuff if the system froze.",0,1626373838

1057,This crusty old man couldn't be patient and got arrested,"Very minor backstory: I work in a small family owned general goods-esque store that despite being a tiny establishment offers a delivery service for orders in a certain range. I live in a small town that is several miles away from anything of note, in England.

Story: this guy who sounds at least in mid 50's calls our shop roughly a week ago to get a few things from our store for a home delivery, keep in mind this guy lives at least a 45 minute round trip from our store which is usually ok when people make large orders. This guy would repeatedly make tiny orders in the range of £15-£20 making it not much worth our time or money to make the journey for this ungrateful asshat. Given the circumstances of both this guy living very far away and making tiny orders we would always file his orders at very low priority meaning he would have to wait the longest for his delivery since there were always closer and larger orders to fulfill, whenever I quoted him the time it would take for his order to get to him you best damn well believe that if this order took more than 3 minutes than the time I quoted I would receive a snotty followup call asking where his stuff was. This got annoying but was overall tolerable until he started messing with our delivery drivers when they were unfortunate enough to be given his order, he would pull stupid crap like taken ages to answer his door when my driver arrived, I'm talking like 15 or 20 minutes he would have them waiting, then he started acting like he couldn't afford to pay my driver when his order finally did arrive, keep in mind this fool lived on some 5 acre gated property that overlooked a lake in his back garden so he could absolutely afford to pay our drivers. I kept telling my boss about this but for the longest while he stuck by business is business until he assaulted one of the drivers after he arrived about 35 minutes late after he got a flat tire driving down all the stupid gravel roads that lead to his property. After this transpired the customer had the audacity to call our store to complain about the lateness of the driver and that the driver had called him a manner of swear words after he was physically assaulted, he punched my driver in the head and torso a few times. So not only did this customer get barred and blacklisted from our shop but he also found himself with a criminal record all beause he couldn't be patient enough to wait half an hour.

TL:DR Be patient kids and you won't end up with a criminal record.",0,1626350233
1058,No Good Deed goes Unpunished,"Although I no longer work in retail, I spent nearly 10 years working there, first as an agent, then as a supervisor. We provided tech support as a walk in for a services company.

An old friend reached out to me , asking if I could help his friend with some TV problems. I am quite busy with my career and didn't really have time, but I found 5 mins and called his friend. She was very grateful and we discussed the issue. The issue was a bit strange, but since she was desperate to get her tv stb to work, I promised to visit the following week.

I went on Tuesday, a 30 min drive in my free time. The issue was strange, but I did not see it while I was there. I spent around an hour trying to replicate it, took as many details as I could, and opened a case with our tv section. Yesterday I tried to give her as many updates as I could, but she was starting to get annoyed and sending me hourly updates what her tv was doing. When I told her that we need to test more, she dropped the ""I may have to cancel the service if this takes any longer"" bomb. Im like.. Lady I don't even work in this section, Im trying to help you and this is what I get? I ignore her.

Today, she is still annoyed. I told her to test the STB with a monitor (she has no other TV), and she told me that she will not watch TV on a monitor. I told her its just for testing purposes... she told me this is getting ridiculous. Exasperated, I called her and I told her that I cannot help her any longer, I will be opening a case with normal tech support for her, and to speak to them. I will not take another help request from this friend.

I was standing behind the register, waiting for customers to select their purchases, when a fun song came in the in-store radio. So I started dancing to it. Right then a lady came in. I will call her Awesome Lady.

AL: You keep dancing, girl!

ME: Thanks, I will! Sometimes you gotta make your own fun at work.

When she got to the register, we chatted a bit. I have a terrible memory, so this may not be exact.

AL: it's so nice too see you smiling. It makes other people want to smile too.

ME: The way I see it, there's enough pain and misery in the world without adding to it. I'd rather put some happy out there!

AL: That's a great attitude. *smiles*

ME: I love that necklace you're wearing, is that mother of pearl?

AL: No, they're coin pearls.

ME: That's cool! They're so pretty.

She paid for her purchase and left. I turned around to stock some items behind the counter. A few seconds later, I heard a small clatter behind me. When I turned around, I saw that she had put the necklace on the counter.

AL: That's for you.

ME: (wide-eyed) Are - are you sure?! That's so kind!

She nodded, smiled, and headed for the door.

ME: Hold it! (I point at her) You need a hug!

AL: (still smiling) I probably do.

With the necklace in my hand, I rushed around the counter and gave her a huge hug.

ME: This is so amazing! You've just made my day.

She left, and I immediately put the necklace on. It is now my happy necklace, and I get a little teary every time I touch it. That lady may never know just how much her gift means to me, but karma owes her big.",0,1626327197

1069,"I wanted to give you flowers, but you stole my money","Hey everyone i hope your doing great. English is not my native language, but i also have no respect for it so i dont really care about mistakes haha. Also Im not from the US and taxes are included in the prices we have.

&amp;#x200B;

I recently started working at a local grocery store (its actually a big chain) where I work 8 hours a week split into two shifts with 4 hours. So I could be working monday - tuesday one week and the next week friday - saturday. So if you come to see me specifically for whatever reason the chances Im actually there arent that high and this story takes place on a thursday my second shift that week and i wasnt working until the thursday the next week. (Also we have those automatic things that move the producets from a bit back of the line to the front but i dont even know what its called in my native language.)

Well a few weeks ago this wome came up to my register. I already have the first product in my hand, ready to scan when she proceeds to tell me she forgot her wallet and cant pay. She would have to go home and get her wallet, that would take her about 30min. My shift was another hour and we dont have an official company rule but everyone working there just rings up (is that how you say it? well i scanned all her products and told the register she 'payed') and she left the things at my register.

I go on with my shift and already kinda forgot about her when she comes to my register again with another beer and some flowers she also wants to buy. I get someone authorised to deal with cancelling her first purchase so my balance is right in the end. Until they come I tell the flowerlady the price something like 75,46€, which she knew because i told her before she left but now she says it cant be that high blabla and she puts a 50€ bill on this thing that moves the products infront of her about an armlenght away from me holding two more in her hands. My supervisor comes and then recalculates the price while we wait for her. The flowerlady still saying its not the right price, but surprise it was (who guessed the register could be right?). 

Well now she wants to pay but the bill she but down in front of her isnt there anymore and she accuses me and my supervisor of taking it. She gets kinda agressive in her tone, demanding that we write down our names (what we do) and in a kinda sad and dissapointed tone she says something like 'I wanted to give you those flowers for being nice but now i cant do this anymore' (like i care about some ugly and tiny bouquet of flowers bought from a grocery store). After paying she wants to leave but she still has the flowers and the beer and I remind her she has to pay those aswell, what she does and then she leaves. On a side note the customer after her, who patiently waited for about 10 minutes, goes on a little rant about the flowerlady saying he knows her and she always makes problems.

So I go on with my live and actually have a good laugh telling this story to my mother. I go in the next week for my first shift (it was an evening shift) and because there was a big turn over of cashiers my register wasnt ready yet. Well as Im waiting my supervisor (a difrrent one) tells me that some Lady left flowers for me yesterday (so wednesday) and she wrote an apology on a reciept paper.  I wish I knew what turned in this Ladies mind that she realised noone stole her money and what in the world made her think coming back and actually buying me flowers was a good idea but you know i appreciate the gesture and till this day my supervisor and I laugh about it. (Those flowers are currently dying in my appartment, but I actually tried taking care of them haha.)",0,1626249875

So I do that, and I’m checking the guy’s items, no big deal. But then the TE guy (tax exempt) says he needs some cigarettes. So, I go to help him get some cigs. It took like 5 minutes, he was buying in bulk. When we got back, the TE guy struck up a conversation with the guy behind him, he apologized, said he did this once a month, blah blah. And then he was getting ready to pay (the TE guy was), and the guy behind him said, “Oh, what now, is the check gonna bounce or something?” And I thought this was just a joke, you know, like friendly banter. And I think the TE guy thought it was a joke, too. So the TE guy said (after he paid with a credit card), “All right, bye, stay happy, friend!” In a real friendly way. But then guy behind him says, “F\*CK OFF!”.  The TE guy, who was chill, said, “Oh my God,” and left. So then I started checking out the guy who said f off (I'll refer to him as Karen). I was doing my thing, and I scanned one case of water bottles in his cart, and I moved it, cause I wanted to see if the other case in the cart was the same or a different brand. Turns out, it was the same. But Karen said, “Oh, just scan the top one twice!” In a really exasperated voice. So I did. He then added, “Is it your first day or somethin’?” And I responded, “I am new.” (which is true, I started like a week ago). And he said, “I can see that!” And then I continued. One of my managers came over, because my light was flashing from the TE guy (we click a button to make our lights flash on and off in order to get a manager's attention if we need help), and asked if anything was wrong. Karen chimed in and said, “He’s fine, but the customer’s not! This service is terrible! I usually go to \[other store\], but I decided to try \[this store\], and I’m never coming back, I’m sticking with \[other store\]!” and the manager was like “Okay sir, I’m sorry sir.” in a voice that sounded like she wanted to say “All right you scrub, just shut up and get your receipt you moron”, so I don't think I'm going to get in trouble. And then I gave Karen his receipt and then he left. Good riddance!",0,1626247340
1071,Don’t judge a book...,"So tonight I had a very nice family come to the register. Mother, Daughter, a maybe 5 year old and a toddler the mother was holding. Told them to give me a second cuz I had to show my boss something down the aisle (in view of the register). I come back and cash them out noticing a birthday balloon they placed at the end of my belt was missing and in its place was an empty package for skull caps. Manager went and watched the cameras. He came back laughing. Apparently in the thirty seconds I was gone the mother ditched the empty package that she had hiding under the toddler and shoved the balloons in her purse. They paid for everything else and were really nice which is why he was laughing. The total of what they stole vs what they paid? $4.75 stolen but they paid for the $50 worth of stuff.

1072,A mobile phone that doesn't charge,"Since first post went well I'll share more of my experiences.
This guy around his late 40s comes and tells me he wants to buy one of those old phones with the buttons since he is working and he wants to have a durable phone while at work .After I showed him some of the options he ended up buying one of them, he thanked me and then left  everything went well right? Well he came around one hour later telling me the phone isn't charging.I take it I try to charge it indeed it wasn't charging.So I started the normal procedure when there is a faulty device I started packing it (so we can send it back to the company) as I'm packing I notice the battery inside the box.Confused I went ahead and asked him if he knew the battery was inside the box which he replied yes I then asked him why he didn't put it inside the phone and he said ""I didn't want to there is no need right? I can just charge it and use it , smartphone don't have one"".It took a lot of effort not to laugh.I then explain him about smartphones that they have it pre built etc.He understood he apologized (he also looked a bit embarrassed) ,took the phone and left.

Small bonus: Small funny story that it's too small to have  its own post there was this woman in her mid 30s she wanted to buy a smart tv she looked like she knew what she was talking about everything went smooth she got the tv and before leaving the store she asked me how many hours does she need to charge the tv before using it.",0,1626238127

1075,"“Honey, is this really all you have?”","Alright, so, I used to work at a gas station. I worked the overnight shift, and just know this I’m 4’11. I’m tiny, and I’m working overnights by myself. This was back in November of 2020. Around 2am, a man comes in with a mask on and his hood up. I looked up at him and he said, “Do you have any Marlboros?” I thought it was weird he asked that, because there’s how many kinds behind me you can see. So I say back, “yes, what kind?” He seemed taken back by my question for some reason. I thought he was maybe on drugs, because it happens. He then says, “Oh, um, Marlboro reds.” I turned around and grabbed the cigarettes off of the shelf behind me. Just as I was about to scan the cigarettes, the man suddenly came behind the register. He stood behind me with something pressing against right my side. “Give me your money honey,” he said to me. I felt so scared and froze for a moment. I opened my register and while doing so I attempted to press the panic button about five times. The nearby police station is literally like 3-5mins away. “Are you trying to call the cops?” He asked me. In that moment, I didn’t know if he actually saw me press the button or not, but it scared me even more. I didn’t know if he would hurt me. I didn’t know what he had against my side. This man had the audacity to ask me, “Honey, is this all the money you have?” I was so dumbfounded by this question. Even if I had anymore money I wouldn’t tell you. It’s the middle of the night that was your first mistake buddy. Suddenly he starts rushing me out of nowhere. I ended up giving him all the bills out of my register which only came to 60 something. After he takes the money he runs off and I called the cops. Camera footage shows him dropping a knife. I was so terrified and in shock I didn’t realize it fell. I just wanted him to get off of me and leave me alone",0,1626215036
1076,There are such things as dumb questions.,"I work in a couple souvenir shops in a little mountain town. This is my first retail job in about 4 years, and I don't feel like I've gotten as many head scratchers at past retail jobs as I have this summer. Most of them are silly things that I just either get annoyed with answering over and over or questions that I would never have thought to be asked. Here are a few of them:

-People asking me if they can put stickers on their truck. It's a damn sticker, it'll stick to any smooth surface, I don't give a hoot where you put it.

-People asking me if a fanny pack is in fact a fanny pack and how to wear it. Yes, it is a fanny pack, and once again I do not care, wear it however you want. One person even bought one only after I confirmed that fanny packs are currently ""trendy"". I have also been asked how to wear a regular backpack several times. 

-People asking me if I have anymore of a certain shirt that's on display in the front window. No, we just like to taunt everyone with what they could have. What kind of store advertises things in the window and doesn't have them for sale in the store??

-People asking me if my dog is real. If you can't tell a real dog from a statue, I just don't know what to tell you.

-(Unrelated to the store itself, more so to the town I'm in) People asking me if there are bears in town. We're in the heart of the rockies, if bears being here is a surprise to you, please don't venture too far from main street. On the same note, I have also been asked how somebody could find a mountain lion, and at what elevation deer become elk. Seriously. 

-People asking me if we still have a product that the store sold several years ago, when there are clearly none on the shelf. Maybe it's just if you have worked retail, but that one should be pretty obvious, I feel.

-People asking me if they can take a product out of the store so they can find the person they want to show it to. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think ANY store would let you walk outside with an unpaid-for product. *Shakes head*

That's all for now. Again, mostly harmless questions, just with seemingly (to me) obvious answers that I have to answer almost every day. Anyway, hope you guys enjoyed reading, and best of luck with the rest of the summer season in the US!",0,1626208619

1078,Definitely not trying to steal,"Having a lot of these stories recently, must be due to the tourist season.


Guy in the store for a loooong time. Almost an hour. At one point the only guy in the store. Spending a lot of time in one corner at the front by vacuums. Refusing help when asked. 


At one point, grabs a Bluetooth speaker, heads straight for that same corner. My colleague tells me that to intercept as I can see him walking quickly towards the door. Apparently he couldn't get the spiders (alarms) off the boxes, so he would've set off the door alarms, so I guess he must be quick.


I intercept, ""Hi, I can pop those through for you"". Not a happy face but not an outwardly annoyed one either.


Scanning through his items, I say ""you can get a guarantee with the speaker, I'll just need some details for the system. I assume that you're a mister..."" *this is a joke I throw in with a smile to all obviously male presenting customers and I almost always get a laugh, not today*


Customer:"" WHAT DO YOU MEAN THAT YOU NEED MY DETAILS?! THE RECEIPT IS ENOUGH!""

Me, taken aback by him going 0-100 instantly, but staying calm: ""The system is just asking for details incase something goes wrong, so it's easier for us to find your details. If you're not happy with that, though, I'll just pop down Mr X."" 

Cue another minute or so of shouting about us not needing his details, his aggression being met with a smile from me because he's has to pay nearly £200 for products he hoped to get for free. 


He definitely didn't look suspicious screaming over being asked for his name, though",0,1626199497
1079,Gift boxes are not complicated,"Customer asks for large gift boxes. I let him know the largest we carry is the kind for clothes. He kinda looks at me weird and then asks where they are. I point him to the correct aisle and go on my merry way. 

Few minutes later, he comes back and says he couldn't find them. I'm a little concerned because they are in a spot that makes them easy to find, but whatever. I go to the aisle and point them out. He stares at them like he doesn't believe me. ""Do these have the top and bottom?"" At this point I realize that he thought the boxes would already be made, while these were flat and needed to be unfolded. I explain that to him. He still has a look that says he doesn't really believe me, but I guess he relents. 

Then he asks, ""can you wrap them?"" To me it sounded like he was asking if these boxes had the capability to be wrapped so I was like, yeah the gift wrap is right here. Then he's like, ""do *you* wrap them?"" And I'm like, oh no we don't offer gift wrapping services. Once again he looks at me like I'm the stupid one. ""Well, I'll buy it, will you wrap it??"" Now I'm getting angry. We do not offer gift wrapping services. He is still giving me this stupid look so I just ask if he needed anything else and walk away when he said no lol

I then asked the costumer if he wanted to pay before I made his order since that's usually easier for both me and the costumer.

So on my very first day, I had this guy walk up with like a pack of gummies and some other items. He sits the gummies down and mumbles something under his breath. So I ring his stuff up and when I get to his gummies I ask if he wants them or if he wants them in a bag and he just looks at and yells “no I said I want to eat them”. Now my hearing isn’t that good and I know he mumbled anyway so I just ignored it. I don’t remember his total, but for the sake of the story, we’ll just say it was 10.64. He hands me a 20 and a nickel. And I give him the change the register tells me, which obviously included pennies. He looks at me and goes no this isn’t right, and I go “excuse me?” And he said “I gave you that nickel so I wouldn’t have any pennies. I swear you damn kids can’t do math or anything now a days. I can do math in my head” I didn’t say anything and just took his pennies and rounded it up and gave him a nickel, and I didn’t say anything and just kept looking down the whole time because I’m a relatively shy person. But if your change already wasn’t a multiple of 5 then adding a nickel wouldn’t change that. This is essentially just me ranting the story.",0,1626152561
1087,No one greeted me when I walked in,"I used to work at a home goods store that was known for its imports that has since gone bankrupt.

My store’s location was closing permanently due to our landlord not renewing the lease and this particular story takes place during the last month the store was open.

This particular night there were three of us working, me, another associate, and the sales lead. It was the closing shift and the store was closing early because we had reduced hours since the store was going out of business. The store is almost empty of inventory since we’re so close to closing and you can basically see whoever walks in from anywhere in the store. Company policy normally is that someone stays near the front of the store to man the cash register and be able to greet any customer that walks in.

Well tonight the store was surprisingly busy, there were about 15 customers in the store and they all wanted to ask questions and have their hands held through choosing things and we had to start closing duties.

And at this point, when the other associate had walked to the back to start closing duties and me and the sales lead were both actively helping other customers, in walks Brenda.

I see her enter the store but can’t greet her as I’m talking to another customer but I make a mental note to follow up with her. The customer I was helping had a ton of questions and I didn’t get away from them for another ten minutes after Brenda walked in. At that point Brenda is looking at a display by the cash register so I walk up and ask her how she’s doing and she informs me she’s ready to check out.

No problem! I can do that! We made pleasant small talk while I rung her out and explain that everything is final sale and my sales lead was able to come up and help bag things about halfway through the transaction to help speed things up. As we come to the end of the transaction Brenda starts talking about how it’s a shame the store is closing then sighs and says “but it’s no surprise I guess since no one even greeted me tonight when I came in.”

I was taken completely off guard and kind of froze but started to try to apologize and she doubled down and said “oh no! It’s true none of you bothered to try to talk to me when I walked in!”

I don’t remember exactly what I said but it was something to the effect of “I’m sorry I was with another customer but we do make our best efforts to greet everyone but sometimes it’s just not possible.” Then she replied with something snarky and left.

It made me super mad though because the store was literally closing and we were all going to be jobless in a month but go forbid we don’t say hi to you when you walk in to our bare bones store!",0,1626141087

1091,Customer weirdly hostile to cashier.,"this woman came I last night while I was training a new employee, and right off the bat it was clear she didn’t like me. She and coworker were both Native American and I am not, idk if that had anything to do with why she hated me on sight but immediately acted like she was BFFs with coworker. Neither coworker or I had ever met her before that night. 

She was short and curt when I said the usual hello, but she was very bubbly and friendly with my coworker. She had loudly asked how much a pack of x-brand smokes cost while I was helping a customer before her so coworker grabbed the smokes for me to scan when I was done. when I rang up the cigs and told her the total she just went “Huh? What?” She hadn’t been paying attention so I told her that x-type of x-brand is so-and-so amount. *”Oh.* Okay.” And she immediately pulled out a 10, so I had to stop her and gesture to her case of beer, ask if she was paying for that separately. the woman just scoffed and put it down, angrily going a saying how shes paying for them together in that “what are you, an idiot?” tone that all retail workers are familiar with. I’m biting my tongue and just thinking in what world does a 12 pack of beer and cigs come up to under $10? Plus when would I have scanned it? She had it cradled in her arms the entire time.

Then she looked to the kid I was training, telling him that since I’m so slow he should take over, while laughing like it’s a funny joke (neither me or coworker laughed). Then once her attention was on me as I gave her the new total, she had this awful scowl and demanded a lighter. the lighter rack was right by her hand on the counter. 

She demanded the price of a lighter, eve though the price tags were right in front of her. I gave her the price range anyway. She didn’t like that answer and demanded the cheapest. Didn’t even let me answer before she grabbed one and threw it on the counter. 

During that time I had grabbed a can of beer the customer before her had decided against buying and left on the counter, handed it to coworker asking him to put it back on the shelf. Woman exploded “THATS NOT MINE!” as if I was ringing it up. I know it’s not yours, ma’am. That’s why i asked coworker to put it back on the shelf. But that went in one ear and out the other for her because she angrily reiterated that she’s not paying for that since she didn’t ask for it. Again, i tell her this had nothing to do with her purchases and wasn’t being rung up. She scoffs and says she’s not paying for someone else’s beer. I ignore it and force the topic elsewhere by giving her the final total for her three things. It’s like over 20 and she accuses me of ringing it up wrong because it’s too expensive. So I read off whats been rung up and how much each item was. Beer and smokes aren’t cheap, sorry to break it to you. 

She paid, made some loud comments to coworker about how our boss needs to hire people who know how to work checkout, and left. All throughout it she would ignore me for periods to chat with coworker telling him jokes or other small talk things and then get angry when she talked to me. It was weird af to me.",0,1626124336

I'm an overnight manager for a big grocery store chain in the U.S. which means I have plenty of stories, but this one is one of my favorites. About a year ago, i went in on my night off(my store manager was handing out OT like it was candy)to check the order for the next night and get rid of anything that wasn't needed. I literally came in flip flops and shorts because I thought i was only going to be there for a couple hours( I was wrong), the store closes everything seems normal enough for an average night. So fast forward an hour and a half later when i finished reviewing the order as I'm about to leave, I let in a vendor saying theres a woman at our gas station meowing like a cat, mind you the gas station is a a couple hundred feet a away from the front entrance of our store. Also at this moment we have two guys pressure washing the side walks and windows to our store. I ask them if they heard it as well and they said yes i still think its BS but walk toward the gas station just in case. Literally as soon as I got out of hearing the pressure washer I hear it, loud as hell a meowing I can't see anyone til i get about 50 feet away from said gas station. I'm cautious because not sure if they are on anything. Then I see it a woman rolling on the ground meowing like a cat at the top of her voice and I really dont know what to think I just stood there for a minute watching, and realized theres a little hospital thats open in our parking lot, so I walk over go inside. I ask if theres anything they can do, and they simply put, if the person doesn't come into the hospital they cant do anything. So I walk out to immediately hearing meowingfrom 20 feet away and figure. You know what shes really not bothering anyone I'll leave her be( maybe she will leave, its the dead of night she won't get hurt). As i lgo back into my store I let out the vendor that informed me of said woman I lock the door behind me and figure I have about 5 mins before i leave, I go to check on my back up to make sure she knows what needs to be done, but get stopped because the guys pressure washing are done and need a signature, at said time the vendor that just left came screaming towards me. They said the woman meowing like cat is now throwing rocks and whatever she can find at the window of the gas station. GREAT now I call the cops and let them sort it out, The police come she goes no problem, and i get close enough to ask the cops if she was on anything. Turns out she was super hammered with friends, and said friends left her there.

A few days ago, I happened to be working for the self checkout station. I was standing by the customer service desk when an older lady (OL) stops in front of me on her way out. 

For context: our store occasionally gives away a certain item if you spend over a certain amount. This week, it was a box of snacks, like oeros, ect. 

OL: Is that your giveaway for this week for spending over x amount? 

Me: Yes. I can grab you one if you'd like. 

OL: Well, I don't want it. Can you do a substitution?

At this point, I'm thinking that she may have dietary restrictions or something. We've done substitutions for people who want a vegetarian option before. 

I was wrong. 

Me:  Are you thinking of a substitution for dietary reasons?

She looks super confused, even with her mask on. 

OL: No, I'm asking for another option because I don't like that giveaway. Don't you have anything else?

Me: Unfortunately we do not, this is our only giveaway for this week. You don't have to take it, though. 

Most, if not all people who don't want the giveaway just say no when offered it or donate it to the bread basket box we have in our store. She started walking away from me, so I thought the conversation was done by this point. But she turns around. 

OL: Well, I think you should offer me another option, especially if the customer doesn't like the one the store has. 

Me: I understand, but unfortunately, this is the giveaway that was chosen for this week. There is no other free option. 

She was pretty annoyed at this point. 

OL: That's ridiculous. What's the value of the giveaway, then?

Me: The value of the giveaway is 25 dollars, but it is given for free when spending over x dollars. 

OL: Well, take 25 dollars off of my bill then. 

This doesn't even make sense, since the product we giveaway is...free. It's nothing like a coupon. I was super confused now. 

Me: Unfortunately, I cannot do that. That giveaway is the only option the store offers this week. 

OL: This store needs to offer another giveaway. 

It was getting busy again, and I was getting pretty tired of repeating the same thing over and over again. 

Me: Well, you can take the free giveaway. Or, your other option is to not take it all.

1097,Customers don't Read #1: Soda Water Eggs Chips,"I just want to thank all you customers who just buy for now/what looks good and even if you think you read you were still wrong and overpaid, all so I can get my products at lower prices, since the average price sold is high enough still for the company to make money. 

I get if you only have $X to your name right now (ofc not an essential item so not a best way to spend that last bit of money), but these people always have the money right then and there (or could easily pick up something else from their cart next paycheck) and in the very short term save money.

Example #1:  **Soda**

Regular price $5.49 for 12 $7.99 for 20 SALE buy 2 20 packs for $5.99 each.

This is a long enough term shelf stable product that doesn't take up too much room. I know for a fact you are going to buy 40 total soon anyways. Too many people buy only 1 20 pack. For the 20 pack, I most of the time tell ""Do you know we have these on sale blah blah"". Most of the time, ""Oh really, let me get another"". Heck a lot of people also get 3 or more 12 packs (all the same flavor). AKA 36 for $16.50 or 40 for $12, uhm, this is 4 more cans and $4.5 right here and now. Heck even if you have 2 flavors say 2 cokes and 1 diet coke, still easy enough choice to pick 1 of each 20 instead. 6c per can ($1.5 per 20) saved just 12 vs 20 normal price. Thus, I don't even bother asking with the 12 pack people. I even get 1 12 pack is all they want now vs 40, but jeez it's not that much more space and such a huge savings and they are shelf stable (and ofc they have the money or could pick something for next paycheck).

&amp;#x200B;

Example #2: **Water**

1 case for $3.99 SALE buy 3 for $10.

These are heavy and big and less savings. But still, our stores customers drink water like crazy. $2 is $2.

Also, I know some/many people only want certain brands (this brand does not get bought much unless it's on sale), but so many also don't care and we have another sale of 4 for $10 at the same time. Which amount of water is def a savings (not sure on how many and how many oz per), and still in carry wherever bottle form of a brand that they buy all the time, sale or not, as well.

&amp;#x200B;

Example #3: **Eggs**

Different but still generic brand 5 dozen can't even check if cracked for $7.99 1 2.5 doz for $3.69 SALE 2 2.5 dozen for $5.

This is perishable and at times hard to fit all in the fridge. That said, those that deliberately spend $3 more NOW are crazy (Right?). I also get plenty of people who make the long trek across the store after I tell them. If I was less than honorable I could give my register $2.28 plus tax (under $2.50 total) and instead of paying $5 plus tax, save myself over $2.50 and gotten my 5 dozen eggs.

&amp;#x200B;

Example #4: **Chips**

Small Size 1.99 Large Size (can't recall exactly but not a good deal) Regular Size $3.49 for 1 SALE 3 for $5.97.

These people have the money and often take me up on it. 

VS Small size for $4 more aka pretend you bought 3 at that size (some actually do grab 3 or more), you'd end up getting not ""3"" but 4x the chips, and all in still 3 reasonable size bags.

 VS Large 3 different flavors (if you want) or at least can not let them get stale, for less money RIGHT NOW.

VS 1 Regular Come on under $1.50 and you get 2 more bags of the same size, you know you are going to buy again really soon anyways.

VS 2 Regular. OK, Come on now, you really want to spend $1 more right now and not get a 3rd bag of chips? At this point, if I wasn't so honorable, I'd be able to pretend they'd bought 3. I'd then get $1 and a bag of chips each time they did this.

&amp;#x200B;

I work hard for what little money I get. I will take a little bit of time reading to at least save money NOW and even next couple weeks. I go much further than that (full pantry, lowest price paid in like 3 month window stalked up at least to be used for that length of time), but most people really should be able to do NOW and SOON. **Make your money work for you.** You don't need to work/earn more if you just read/pay attention. OFC if everyone did that, the average price for people like me would be higher. Not sure if then I'd be able to afford what ""basics"" I do buy.",0,1626069356

1099,Quarter Lady,"This is one of my favourite retail ‘horror stories’ to tell. I work at a drugstore, and in the couple days before Christmas we used to be open until midnight instead of 10PM. (now we close early on Christmas Eve, lol)

So it’s Christmas Eve, about 11:45 PM. I make the announcement over the loudspeaker that we’re closing in 15 minutes, please proceed to the checkout, etc etc. This lady wanders over and asks if I can help her in electronics, which is just next to the main checkout. I help her, recommend a nice pair of headphones for her kid, and she comes up to my till at about 11:50 with a full cart. 

All in all her total is around $500. And her credit card declines. 

At this point the supervisor has come over to pull the security gate. 

The lady says “oh I have cash in my car, can I run and grab it?”

We say okay, because Good Customer Service™️ and all that. So she comes back with a purse and starts pulling out $50 bills. And I’m thinking to myself okay, that’s manageable. 

Then she pulls out rolls of quarters. She paid $250 in quarters. We were stuck in the cash office counting quarters for 30 minutes.",0,1626057840

1102,Customer is mad about price…,"Hello all, first time poster here! 

So I started working for a retail supply store in the recent months. I use to be a server and switched to retail and it’s been pretty good but today is the first day I’ve had a bad customer interaction.

So a lady comes in and is looking for some hair rollers. I show her what we have in stock and go about my day. She found some that she wanted and she asked what the price was. I told her what the tag said, since she said she could not see very well. I told her, based on the tag price, that it was only a few dollars. We immediately go to the register and the rollers ring up about $15 more. The rollers were placed in the incorrect location. I immediately tell her the price difference and she gets super upset. I tell I am sorry but they were placed in the wrong location. She tells me that since I told her they were a cheaper price, that I had to honor that price. I tell her I have to call my manager because I cannot change an items price without my managers approval. This lady is very insistent that I have to honor the price I told her, even though I told her they were placed in the wrong location. So she gets more upset when I can’t get my manager on the phone. The lady then demands my name and my managers name. I give it and I also call my manager again. 

My manager answers and I explain what happened in all of the five minutes I interacted with this lady. My manager says we cannot override the price because it was such a big difference and the only thing we can do is give the lady our customer service number. I say okay and inform the lady of what my manager has said. 

The lady decides to not buy anything and tells me she will “take care of this tomorrow”. I tell her okay and have a good day. I guess she thinks that I said something else under my breath and gets aggressive and basically says I will be lucky to keep my job after this. I just keep telling her to have a nice day and she eventually leaves. I guess I just don’t understand, being new to retail, why she got so aggressive. Anyway, I guess not the worse interaction but I definitely felt bad afterwards. 

TL;DR Lady is rude over price difference and thinks she is going to get me fired.",0,1626042051

1104,I go the extra mile for a challenging customer and barely get a thank you,"I was just getting done a huge rush of paint orders and getting ready to grab a 5 gallon bucket for a nice couple when this woman walks up to the desk, blocking my way out, holding four tubes of subfloor adhesive. She’s got That Look on her face, y’all know the one. 

“I need a case of these, but you only have these four. do you have a case anywhere?” 

“If they’re not in that aisle I think we also keep them in lumber,” I answer, trying to finish this couple’s order. They’ve been here since before the rush was over and were very polite and patient. 

“Well, can you call and ask?” The customer asks. “I have to pick up some plywood and I really don’t want to walk back over here. I stumble over a reply trying to say I know for a fact they’re over there, then give up and dial lumber. I’ve seen it over there before, but considering the shortages of products I couldn’t guarantee it would be there. Naturally, they don’t pick up. Getting annoyed, I decide screw it, I’ll go look myself. I ask my coworker to finish the order I’m working on and let the customer know I’m going to check myself. 

She’s still blocking the opening to the desk, so I have to step around her to get out. I first check our aisle, which surprise surprise, nothing in top stock, and then walk all the way down to lumber, which is across the store from paint, my department. 

Thankfully we have some, nearly a full case, so I pick them up and walk them over to her (she was following about 10 feet behind). I set them in her cart, and the says, “you found those pretty quick, you don’t have one that’s not opened? I don’t want these rolling around in my car” 

“No, sorry,” I say. “This is all we have.” 

“And it’s not even a full case,” she gripes, “but I have these four so I guess it’s okay.” She thanks me halfheartedly and walks away. 

This woman took me away from my job, made me walk across the store to find a product from her, I carried a full case of construction adhesive to her cart, which is kind of heavy, and it still wasn’t good enough. And the “thank you” I got was out of necessity, not because she was particularly grateful for what I did.

1107,"No, I can’t honor that price","I’ve worked at a big box retail store for a little over three years now and I felt the need to post one of my millions of crazy stories. 

This happened about a month after my first day, so I was still pretty new (PT) and learning little by little every day. Of course, they don’t provide the best training for people and just kind of throw you wherever and see how you do. It’s definitely a learn-from-your-mistakes kind of a job. 

It was my first nine hour shift on a Sunday and I was closing on the registers. Of course, everyone rushed up to the registers five minutes before closing and I had a line of four people with big transactions. I managed to get everyone out of the doors three minutes after closing. 

I started collecting all of the hard tags and hangers to put them on a U-Boat so that I could take them back to the stockroom. My manager was at the other end of the store shutting down the other registers. Loss Prevention has already left for the day. 

Ten minutes after closing, I see a heavy-set thirty-something woman with a shopping cart stuffed with kids clothes literally running to my register, all smiles. Let’s call her Kelly. 

Kelly: “Looks like I made it just in time!”

Me, obviously aggravated and wanting to get home: “Actually, we are closed but I can ring you up really quick.”

Kelly starts tossing her items on the counter and the first item had a clearance sticker directly on the barcode, which happens occasionally. I price corrected the item and moved on to the next. Lo and behold, the next item also had a clearance sticker right on the barcode. And the next, and the next. 

At this point, I know that this customer was popping tags like Macklemore. I started staring daggers at her as I had to peel off every clearance sticker to scan the barcode.  Kelly becomes fidgety and checks her phone for any coupons we have. She looks up and notices I stopped price correcting. 

Kelly: “What are you doing?”

Me: “I noticed that somebody put clearance stickers on active product, so I’m not going to honor the prices on the stickers.”

Kelly, being defensive: “Well, that’s not my problem.  This is your guys’ fault for being stupid.”

Me, having done a couple of price change events knowing damn well that we wouldn’t do that: “You see how the stickers are directly on the barcodes? We always put the clearance stickers above or below the barcodes, never on top. Also it shows the original price on every clearance ticket and none of them match.”

Kelly: “Then who would do such a thing?”

Me: “You tell me!”

Silence for a few minutes as I’m peeling all of the stickers carefully to scan the barcodes. 

Twenty minutes after closing rolls around and I’m stuck with an armful of go-backs and still helping this customer. She ended up buying about half of the merchandise in her shopping cart and using a coupon. 

Kelly, huffing and puffing: “I’m never shopping here again. What happened to the customer is always right? You’re a bitch!”

Me, in the best customer service voice: “I hope you have a great night! Thanks for shopping with us!”

Kelly irritatedly grabs her bag and walks out of the doors, less than ten minutes before I’m supposed to clock out. 

Thankfully, I haven’t seen Kelly since. I told the closing manager exactly what happened and she was baffled by the situation.",0,1626024030

1109,No Shower No Problem,"So I worked in a pharmacy that's within a grocery store. They had secret shoppers that grade your department on performance and can get you in trouble if you don't walk them to the item,aren't polite or whatever they wanna dock you for. They can look wild or normal from what I was told so I was just nice to everyone.  I'm ending my shift when this old woman comes up to the pharmacy asking where she could find wipes. She had rollers in her hair, a raincoat(despite it being gorgeous outside)  and big glasses. I told my pharmacist I'd handle it since the wipes were nearby and I could just help her and go home. 

The second I step outside of the pharmacy and get next to her, I notice a bad odor but shrug it off. I walk her to the baby wipes and she says that's not what she needs. She says they're skin safe and you can use them on your face. I think witch hazel wipes instead but that's still not it. She can't describe them but just says you can shower with them and INSISTED she got them at my store. I try to convince her that we don't carry such a product ,but she wasn't having it. She starts asking for help with other items while we look for the wipes. I didn't want to get in trouble, so I continued. We walk all over the store (like almost 20 minutes) until she asks for toilet paper.  

I reach for a case on the top shelf for her and she gasps so loudly that I get scared and nearly drop it. She says that she's found the wipes,but when I look over she has FLUSHABLE WIPES in her hands. She goes ""See I told you they were here! I use these to wash my hands and shower so I don't actually have to take a bath! Since I've found these who needs soap? Isn't that so smart? "". I ask her if she needs anything else, she says no and lets me go. I booked it so fast to the time clock and just scrubbed my hands afterwards. The best part is,she wasn't a secret shopper,just some crazy lady who hates using soap!",0,1626020962
1110,I want two of the smaller ones.,"I work at a grocery store simply referred to as ""The Pig"" in america. I work in the meat department in the back as part of the cleanup crew once the butchers are gone. It's low enough staff that I tend to have to cut things when I'm the only on there. Anyway, onto the encounter.

I was putting ground beef into containers and getting ready to wrap them up and put them out in the case when a lady walked up. ""Can I have a medium ground beef please?"" Here we have three sizes. Family packs are the largest, 4D (tray size) is the medium, and 2's are the smallest.

I pull out one of the 4D trays she asked and it's like $7.50. ""Oh I cant afford that, can I get two of the smaller ones."" .....I wrap them up and look at her funny as she walked away, half tempted to call her back and explain math to her. Because those two packages she got were for a total of around $9. She was a part of my generation (I'm 25) and it concerns me that I've seen this happen more often than not.

1111,We had to jump in.,"So a few months back I was working my normal 2 hour shift it was a really busy in the store from workers and people. There was a massive load from stuff (normally about 1200 boxes now 2000 boxes) and we were running around like chickens without a head.

I was done with my cart and brought it to the back to get a new one. The new one had some stuff from another aisle so I put it there and put the boxes on but was blocking the way to a few customers. I was done and put it away just 10 steps further and I heard arguing.

I turned around and saw a woman and 3 teenagers screaming at each other. Apparently the woman wanted to go around the corner but couldn't because of me so had to wait for a minute and the teenagers too. The woman wanted to get out and the teenagers wanted to get in. The woman went behind me when I went away but the teenagers thought they could step behind the cart immediately but got hit by the woman's cart.

So I went there too calm everyone down but they wouldn't stop screaming. And I told someone to get the manager. But it was too late. A teenager screamed ""come fight me then."" and the woman said you want me to hit you cause you are a p*ssy

And then a load clap the teenager hit the woman. She immediately hit him back and they started fighting. And we jumped in to stop them. I got hit in the face a couple of times and so did my coworkers. 

The boys got out of the store faster than a formula 1 car. They some thing but they ran away. No cops where called and the woman got 10% discount and I got a talking too by my manager that I didn't shouldn't hit a customer even if they hit me. 

This week I saw the teenagers again and they weren't fighters anymore but shoplifter they stole around 60 euros of stuff and got away. And that's the end",0,1626012951

Guy: A matching set for my wife.

Me: Great. What size?

He then proceeds to gesture with his hands around about how big her chest is and somehow expected me to work the size out from that.

He eventually leaves after explain to him that I can’t guess her size from that and I say that he can come back later after he’s found out and I can help him then.

Lady: *pointing to an item she has just returned* Can i exchange this for a different size?

Me: Unfortunately that is an online only product so we don’t have them in the store, but you can order another one from the website instead.

Lady: What does online only mean?

Me: It means it’s only on the website and not available in stores.

Lady: *looking confused* So you don’t stock this in store?

Me: Unfortunately not.

Lady: Could you check out the back?

Me: We definitely don’t have any, this one you’ve just returned is the only one we have in the building.

I think to myself that she is starting to understand.

Me: I can help you re-order it on the website if you would life?

1116,"Due to Technical Difficulties, Guy Threatens to Rob the Place","I work in a retail chain that is prevalent in a lot of small towns.  The equipment tends to malfunction a lot, but we always find ways around these problems to keep the cash flow coming and the customers happy.

Well, July 3rd, our store suffered a brownout.  The lights dimmed and brightened for about five minutes, and then a particularly strong dimming made alarms go off in the store as well as shut down the registers.  After everything came back online, it was realized that the card machines no longer worked.  The store's connection to the net was down, as were the phone lines.  We tried to restart everything, but nothing worked and tech support was useless.  So we had to do something we knew would hurt us that day.

We had to accept cash only.

Bear in mind, we were insanely busy with people buying supplies for their cookouts and such.  We made a point to inform EVERY. SINGLE. PERSON. who came through the doors that we were accepting cash only.  Most people either said okay, or turned around and left.  But one customer...he decided that this was an absolute affront to him personally.  He stood at the entrance of the store, pacing back and forth, and literally growling.  My line was very long, and I was working as fast as I could to check people out.  All the while, this man is still making angry sounds and muttering to himself.

At one point, he approaches me and snarls (I'm not kidding, he really snarled) ""Why are you only taking cash???""

Me:  ""We had a brownout, and our card systems are down right now.""

Him:  (getting, or at least trying to, in my face) ""Then you need to lock the \*\*\*damn doors!!!""

He stomped outside.  I was hoping this was the end of it, so I apologized to the person I was checking out, who looked stumped to say the least.  A few customers later, the man stomps back inside and yells for everyone to hear:

""What if I came back and robbed the place?!""

This was a VERY bad move, as some of our sister stores had been robbed in recent weeks.  I was stressed out beyond belief, and as someone who suffers from major depressive disorder and severe anxiety, I snapped back:

""No one is robbing this place while I'm standing here!!!""

The man went scowled and dashed out of the store.  My manager burst from the office, looking after him.  ""Did he just say what I think he said?!""

Me:  ""Yep!""

She went after him, and made sure that he left the premises.  There was only one other problem customer that whole day, but this guy was the worse of the two.",0,1625989208
1117,"No sir, I am not hiding roasted chicken from you. We are just closed.","So I find this event amusing after the debate I sparked in another thread about the hate relationship  food retail workers have with those ""last minute"" shoppers. 

To clarify what I mean by ""last minute"". I'm not talking people coming during open business hours. I'm talking the people that walk up *as* you're closing and start demanding service. So for the last two days a post I made sparked debate on whether or not we should have the right to hate last minute shoppers. And tonight I had 2 customers that reminded me why we *do* have that right. 

Long day, had 2 call outs and a no call no show. So already it's a bad day. As the manager, I agreed to work the max amount of legally allowed hours in one shift (12 hours) to cover the call out and take the stress off my closing crew. However it meant that I had to have us done and ready to go at closing time so that I didn't leave them alone when I had to leave. And we were on point.

Cue literally two minutes before lights off. Lady walks up to the sub bar. Starts demanding a snadwhich. Fine. Were technically still open. She claims it's an ""easy order"" and then proceeds to order FIVE SUBS. Alright, we will deal. Me and my crew knock them out in five minutes and get the bar recleaned in another five. 

Meanwhile I run out to break down the hot bar (rotisserie chickens, baked 8 pieces, and fried) and get it done, scanned out and out in the trash. So far were good, last minute sub lady only put us off by 10 minutes.

As I come back from trashing the hot bar and am starting to corral my employees out of the department, this nasty old man cuts us off with his cart and asks if we have anymore rotisserie chicken. I politely tell him, I'm sorry but no. The department and bar close at 10pm. This guy huffs and puffs and walks away.

We make it to the time clock and I've literally got a minute to spare before going over 12 hours. While im punching out I realize that grumpy old man has followed us because the time clock is right next to the customer service desk. He loudly announces (to make sure I hear) that he has a complaint. I literally rolled my eyes at him. I'm off the clock, I no longer have to play nice. He proceeds to complain to the MOD that we had the audacity to break the bar down when it was supposed to be broken down, so his late ass couldn't buy chicken. He says that he does it ""all the time"" and he knows we just had it sitting back there and refused to serve it to him. I'm trying to sneak out and the MOD stops me. 

Mind you, I've been up and going for the last 13 hours and I am completely beat and just want to go home because I have the morning shift tomorrow which means at this point I'm lucky if I get five hours of sleep before I have to do it all over again tomorrow. So first thing I say is ""Sir, as i explained, we close at 10. That doesnt mean 10:01, it doesnt mean 10:10, it means 10pm. If you want hot product, you need to be here during business hours."" Guys starts to act up and MOD bless his soul turns to the guy and goes ""You heard her. They close at 10."" 

Guy gets pissy and storms off to do the rest of his shopping, my MOD pays for my meal, and I finally get to go home on what's closing in at 14 hours, start to finish, day.

Little old lady comes to me, “could you help me grab some things? I want some heavy things”. I tell her certainly, yes I could help. “Ok, I’ll be back in just 2 minutes, I’ll go grab a box”. 

I didn’t think much of this, I figured she meant a basket. 2 minutes later. She comes back to me with a perfectly formed cardboard box, for own brand caramel cones. Immediately I thought this was suspicious, so after I had helped her collect the shopping I checked the warehouse CCTV. It turns out that little old lady, aged 90 and 3/4, had waltzed in, grabbed a perfect cardboard box from our waste area, waltzed back out and hobbled back to the produce area where I stood waiting.

1120,Is this a terrible thing to do to a retail employee?,"My mind is flashing back to the time that I was twenty years old and working retail. I was running the cash register and at that point had basically been told by my manager that of all the employees on staff, I did the best job at running the register because she could always count on the fact that my drawer would almost never be too terribly off and if it was, it wasn't ever too bad. One day my manager partnered me up on the register with a newer employee but first she pulled me aside and gave me strict instructions including that I wasn't to teach him ANYTHING about that register including the codes to open it. She made it out to be as if he were purely observing me only and she told me to discuss nothing with him about work and answer no questions if he started asking questions about the store. Me being autistic, literal and a strict rules follower followed her instructions to the max. I went on lunch break a few hours later and came back only for my manager to pull me and the girl who covered me for lunch off the register and into the back and lay into both of us because the drawer was off by $50. At this point the guy was long gone. After we both promised and swore up and down and left and right that both of us had followed her instructions to the letter and not taught that guy ANYTHING, my manager calmed down and figured out he must've memorized the codes to the drawer just by watching us. Turns out that that particular employee had been having issues frequently where he'd cover people or be on the register for breaks and when my manager would count his drawer would be off by quite a bit so she started to suspect him of theft. So apparently she decided to test her theory by partnering him up with me for a shift and seeing what happened since she could ""always count on my drawer being most accurate"" she figured out that if as her suspicions became correct MY drawer was off by quite a bit, then she'd have her answer about whether he was stealing and that'd give her enough to let him go. I'm just wondering if it was a crappy thing for her to basically use me as her own personal sting operation without telling me ahead of time? And the fact that not only did she not tell me, when my drawer was off she took me in the back and proceeded to yell at me first before hearing my side of the story...only then did she calm down and explain what happened",0,1625915336
1121,How was I rude?!,"I’m fuming right now because a customer called me “incredibly rude” and “needed to improve my work ethic”. 

So. And I think I said this on this thread before, but my store does not take mobile pay. And the last time a customer insisted on using mobile pay, I snapped at them. 

(Note: our card readers are not set up to take nfc payments, and even if it was, our company will fine our store if we accept that form of payment.)

This time after I rung up the customers, I noticed one of them prepping their smart watch for mobile transaction. So I told them, “sorry, no mobile pay.” They take out their phone and I repeated myself. But they said this was different from mobile pay. I still told them we couldn’t accept that as a form of payment and he said “it’s a Samsung, it works like the magnetic strip of a card so it will work.” I still repeated myself “still we can’t take mobile pay” 
(I did look it up later and it’s not like “mobile pay” but either way we couldn’t take it. On a side note, I had no idea Samsung had that feature. I’m an apple user) 

He then gets mad and said “it’s not mobile pay. you are being incredibly rude. You need to better your work ethic”


Finally after they pay, he request to speak to a manager. All the managers are gone for the day so I direct him to the person in charge. 

I didn’t bother getting close to them but I knew they were informing the person in charge about how “unprofessional” I was. (Which I wasn’t?)

My coworker next to me heard the whole thing and after the customer left he told the person in charge they the got mad over nothing.

1124,Shoplifter gets pregnant,"So I worked for a grocery store or three. While working at one I notice three teenage girls enter our store at about 9 ish all shifty-eyed. Most shoplifters have the same predictable Randall from Monsters Inc sort of eyeshift game that’s a dead giveaway. I was loss in charge of loss prevention (and also safety coordinator, which sucked) so I had the ability, along with the rentacop (RAC) that usually accompanies inner city grocers, to watch these girls on video. 

They make a beeline for the feminine product area and grab either condoms or pregnancy tests, couldn’t see which. I could see that one girl was looking around and pulled the old Uncle Frank and was all put them in your purse to the girl who had a purse. No I couldn’t hear them but I promise this is what was said. They then walk together to the bathroom. No cameras in the bathroom, but the girls came out of it squealing with excitement for the obviously-pregnant third girl. 


They were stopped on the way out by RAC and told to come back in and have a seat. RAC asks to see the purse, nothing there, so then he clears the women’s restroom while I fill out my paperwork and interview girls, have a courtesy clerk get a new ept to scan (need to ring it up and photocopy x 2) and RAC comes back with the box and actual test (positive and gross; no gloves or nothin). Girls are crying, parents are called, this about to get turnt. Girls beg officer to not show the results of the test. 

I wasn’t allowed to let this go, but I really felt for the pregnant girl. The officer convinced her that it’s best they know now so they can get her the help she needs. 

Mom comes in not looking happy. I’ve already processed my part so I’ve moved on by this time (closing duties sucketh) but man did I want to be in that room when mom found out.

1128,Do you have my dream shoes?,"This happened years ago, before online shopping had caught on, so we would often get customers who had unusually demanding requests.

It was a quiet shift in my big box store, and this customer is walking up and down the fancy shoes aisle, clearly looking for something specific. So my coworker and I approach her and ask if we can help her find anything and she says, “ok, this is going to sound weird, but I had a dream last night about this absolutely perfect pair of shoes! They were silver and they fit me so well-do you guys have those shoes?” 

Ok, a challenge-we don’t have any silver shoes, but it’s been a really boring shift so we don’t mind spending a bunch of time trying to help this woman find an alternative. We look at each other and then back at the customer and my coworker says, “um, none of our shoes are silver right now, but we have a few in gold…” and my coworker bends over to grab a pair and show the customer. This woman seems nice, albeit strange, so we’re genuinely trying to help her find an alternative to whatever she dreamt about, but she’s not giving us any actual information; so we’re just grabbing different shoes, and asking if the dream shoes had straps, a tall heel, were they sparkly? And she keeps telling us the shoes are wrong, but not giving any descriptions or details except that they need to be silver and that they were very, very pretty and perfect. She’s becoming less fun now, as she seems genuinely annoyed that we aren’t producing the “dream shoes”. So we start kind of hinting that we’ve now shown her every type of fancy shoe we have and she says, “You must have them-you have everything!” And she starts going down the aisle, pulling out shoes from our surprisingly well-organized shelves, that clearly aren’t silver, and asking us if we have them in silver in another aisle. She’s pointing at the shoe boxes of overstock (which are arranged in a particular order, not related at all to what’s displayed on the shelf underneath) and insisting we pull them down and show her that they aren’t silver heels. (Because we secretly have the most amazing silver heels, we’ve just chosen to hide them in a deranged Willy Wonka style treasure hunt for our own amusement 🙄) 

We finally give up trying to help her, but we can’t go far, because she’s now trying on random pairs of shoes and getting visibly upset that they aren’t what she wants. She asks us for help again, insisting that we check the back, call another store, and show her what is in practically every box up top. After some more irritating back-and-forth, explaining to her that we truly do not have the shoes she’s looking for, as she’s continuing to try on more shoes, leaving a growing pile of them on the floor out of spite, we finally suggest to her that maybe one of the shoe stores in the mall has some silver heels. She sighs, and says the mall is too expensive, accepts that we don’t have the mystery shoes she dreamt about and leaves.",0,1625860251
1129,My First Tale from Retail,"I just started working at our local grocery store about two weeks ago. I work in the Bakery, so a lot of the time, I have to answer question about the breads we put out. How often is the fresh baked stuff put out? Is this made in store? What would you recommend for (insert recipe here)? But, last week, I had, by far, the most bizarre question I've ever gotten about our bread.

I was doing my thing and closing up, as is my job, when this rather young couple walk into my department. I was rather close to the bread rack, but didn't exactly pay much attention to them, as it didn't seem like they needed any help. Well, the man, who we'll call CM, for Confused Man, holds up a loaf of our store brand bread. The girl, who we'll call SG, for Shy Girl, asks him something I didn't catch, and CM looks almost affronted by it. Finally, CM calls me over.

Me: ""Hello, sir, what seems to be the issue?""

CM: ""Hey, question. Is this bread bread?""

A pause.

Me: ""I'm sorry?""

CM starts to laugh as SG walks up with their cart. I don't remember what exactly SG said, but ai was eventually able to figure out that she wanted to know if it could be used as sandwich bread, but had forgotten the word for sandwich.

My mom and I have been laughing at this incident for the past week, not really because of SG or CM's reaction, but just simply because of how strange the question is in general.

1131,The Most Surreal Customer I've Experienced,"I recently found out about this sub, and so I thought I'd share one of my craziest stories I experienced in my opinion. This happened fairly recently; at least a month ago. For context I work for one of the big companies as a cashier. I also haven't worked there for very long and am still fairly new. This occurred when I was on self-checkout. 

It was fairly busy and I was by myself for a bit running around trying to help everyone (we usually have 2 people, I forgot why I was by myself). One lady caught my attention to let me know that the older woman next to her needed my help. 

Now, sometimes we get people who don't know how to use the self-scan, and I have no qualms about helping teach them how to use it. Well, when I get over to her she's immediately freaking out and talking at 100mph. She's saying things like, ""I'm from City and I don't have time to learn this""  and ""Can you just do this for me?"" Immediately I know that this woman is going to be a handful and cause problems if I make the wrong move, so I just agree to help her scan her items. Luckily at this point a coworker had come over to help other people while I helped this lady.

Once I started to scan her things, she's very happy. She starts talking at me and I'm half listening as I'm doing all this for her. I catch a few things like how she's telling me that I'm the greatest and how she loves me. Just showering me in praises and also talking about her life and family. Well that all didn't last too long when I hit a snag. 

The next thing I know I look up at the screen and it's telling me to insert the coupon into the slot. This prevents me from scanning more items. I don't know how it happened, but I knew what to do. We have a piece of cardboard we use to push down coupons when the slot gets full to get past the sensor. I try to explain to the lady I need to get the cardboard because I can't scan anything else until I fix the issue, and that I'll be right back. Immediately, like flipping a switch, she's freaking out again. ""You're leaving me?"" ""So what you're going to be gone for like 5 hours?"" Basically accusing me of abandoning her. I promise her that I'll be back in like 2 seconds and that seems to placate her, so I rush to get the cardboard and go back.

Once I was back she fell right back into how she was earlier; praising me and telling me about her life. I'm once again half listening as I'm working when she tells me she doesn't want to buy some bread she had in her cart. I let her know again I'll be right back to put the bread in the cart we use for unwanted items people leave there. Once again she freaks out that I'm abandoning her. I quickly put the bread away and come back to her once again flipping the switch and being all friendly and nice again. This time I remember her talking to me about celebrities and how they all have diseases. She also mentions Bill Gates' divorce and how she hopes I meet him and marry him...

I finally finish up helping her and she thanks me and leaves. I was EXHAUSTED. Part of me was also feeling like I had just been played; like there was no way someone like that could actually exist in real life. Whether real or a joke I'm just glad I haven't seen her since.",0,1625848468
1132,Literally not my job honey,"(instert on moblie joke here)

So! i work for a bottle shop and where I live we have very stricted rules on buying alcohol, you MUST have a permit to purchase it and on top of that, in our store we are not allowed to accept licences more than 2 months out of date, we can be fined, fired and have the buisness's liquor licence revoked for doing so.

backstory out of the way in comes Karen, attempting to buy several bottles of wine and hands me over a licence that had expired outside of the ok range, obviously I refuse service, attempt to politely explain our company's policies only to have the excuse of 'the new licence is in the mail!' and that 'I have the paper right here' (leading me to explain that we HAVE to use in date photi ids, and paper is not that'
and in a huff she leaves without putting anything back. Which i simply hoped would be the end of it.


jump to today when the lady comes in again, come to the register with her items and starts accosting me about how I 'wasted her time', that she had to go out of her way to get her new licence, that the other shop let her use her old one (we are not the same company nor affiliated with them) and that my coworker had let her use it (who admitted to her it was a mistake on his part and if he had of caught it he wouldnt have served her) and basically just grumbling how bad i am at my job.

TL;DR: Middle age Karen blames 20 something for not making sure Karen's driver's licence is in date and for not risking fine to fuel her alcohol problem",0,1625848038

1139,"Sorry to bulldoze you, but yes, we ARE closed","Well I must say I've just discovered TFR and it's been so fun reading the stories! I've been working the same retail job for almost 3 years now, and I certainly have my fair share of tales. This one happened quite recently and still makes me laugh a little bit. 

For context, I work at a small bake shop. Tues-Fri we close at 6, and on Sat we close at 5. Fri/Sat can often be hectic, which makes closing on time a little more difficult. Our hours are on Google Maps, our website, and also right on our front door. (That doesn't stop people from seeing the CLOSED sign, lowered blinds, pulling on a locked handle, knocking on the window, and getting me to poke my head out just to ask me, ""Are you closed?"" I'm not sure what else people need, but it happens more often than not).

I was working a Saturday shift with my newest coworker, who's quite young but doing a great job. This day, 2 customers came in the door right at 4:59 as I was helping someone else - finally finished that up around 5:08. Already getting a late start closing. 

Naturally, it ended up being a day where the till situation was a nightmare and my poor coworker couldn't even start dishes until basically closing time. Well, we just had to power through so we could get on with our lives. Figure everything out, finishing wiping up, chuck the trash bags just outside the front door, and it was time to put in the security code and lock up. We're scheduled until 5:30, and it was 5:35-ish - not too bad. 

Except of course, the security system decided to be difficult, too, just for fun. So I take over at the pin pad and fiddle around with it for a bit until it finally decided to work properly. Now, once the code is put in, we have a limited time window to exit the store and close the door, or the security system freaks out. Me being dumb, I then realized that while my coworker was at the door, only I had the key to lock up. Cut to me carefully sprinting across the mopped floor to the front door to make it out in time when- 

Just like a Sims character, there was a customer standing right outside the door, appearing from nowhere, talking to my flustered coworker. He barely had the time to say, ""Oh, so you're closed?"" before I came leaping at the door like an Olympic hurdler, pushing past them both, and throwing the door closed while muttering some gibberish about the timer. I did feel bad having almost bulldozed both of them, and I did then calm down a bit and explain that we close at 5 on Saturdays - he had assumed we closed at 6. He was understanding, we all went our separate ways, case closed. 

Afterwards, I thought to myself again - CLOSED sign, lowered blinds, trash bags sitting outside, workers clearly exiting, store hours ON THE DOOR YOU WERE TRYING TO ENTER - please, sir, what more can we do?? At this point, I give up.

(I also later apologized to my coworker for flying through the door like a startled gazelle, and we had a good laugh)",0,1625788171

1144,I'm not required to help you if you won't listen to company policy,"A little backstory first, this was during the height of the global panic. I work as a cashier and my store *required* masks, we offer them at the door and anyone not wearing a mask cashiers were allowed to refuse service to.

I was stuck on self checkout for the day, cleaning the machines and helping out anyone that needed to pay with cash. A group of 3 customers walked up to one of the machines and began buying these little containers of sushi we carried, all unmasked. I went about the normal routine of ""Do you have a mask?"" ""No, the constitution - my rights - blah blah blah"" so at this point I know they don't want to cooperate.

Our self scan has an assist mode used by any cashiers or managers to quickly fix a majority of problem we encounter but it also works as a pause button for customers and they have no control over it in assist mode.

So I pop the machine into assist mode and the ""leader"" of the group is still trying to use the machine and I'm just holding back my smile, I have all the power in the situation. I reiterate ""I can't help you if you refuse to follow company policy"". So the three of them are very visibly angry at this point but they know they have lost. One of them tosses the sushi on the machine and they just all stroll out without any of their stuff.

Tldr: group of 3 refuses to wear masks at self checkout, I pause their machine, they give up and leave",0,1625768349

1146,Yeah sure let me just risk jail time,"(Forgive bad grammar or spelling) A little backstory, I work as a cashier and the company I work for has a policy that requires us to ask *everyone* for ID no matter how old they appear to be when buying alcohol, I've had to sign a paper indicating I acknowledge this and could be fired for not adhering to this policy.


I had been working my shift as usual when an older woman and her daughter come to my register. The older woman was about 80 while her daughter was around 40 or so. They both had their own orders and I began helping the older woman first. She only had about 6 items, 2 of which were 6 packs of beer. So I ask her for her ID as I would with anyone buying alcohol. She seems very confused and asks ""You need an ID for alcohol??"". I'm just sitting there thinking to myself ""are you serious right now, just give me your ID"". After her little fuss she gives me her ID and I finish helping her and I help her daughter out too. 

After i helped them they begin to walk towards the exit when i notice the daughter talking to my manager. So I'm thinking to myself ""what could you possibly be complaining about"". Sure enough the daughter complained to my manager for ID'ing her mother. The Maher comes over to me and says ""I'm not gonna file this as a complaint but you really didn't need to ID her if she's like a 100 year old woman, she's not the cops"", and I'm just standing there with my mind absolutely blown that she would side with this customer when its company policy to do so. Like ""oh yeah let me just risk jail time and my job for some random customer to buy beer"". 

Nothing else has come of the situation, but I have sent a complaint to a higher up and hopefully something will be done about it givin I was asked to break company policy by a manager of the store.

Back last year my province made wearing masks inside mandatory and my store, obviously, followed suit. We were told that no exemptions were allowed.

A guy came in, we told him about the no mask, no service rule and he was really smart about his response, telling us we were discriminating against him because of his illness. He used the proper buzzwords that made it impossible for us to argue our new rule.  
I spoke to my manager about it and it came down the pike that it wasn't up to us to explain or justify the rule, simply to enforce it. 

He stopped coming in, waited outside while someone shopped for him. 

Recently, the mandate ended and masks are now ""Recommended"". 

He came in yesterday and ignored me the entire time, from my greeting to finishing the transaction. At the very last moment, he said, ""Thanks for not discriminating against me."" I just looked at him.

My dude, my guy.. First, no one was discriminating against you for your so-called illness that prevented you from masking up. I was simply enforcing a rule I was told to enforce - as a means of protecting myself and my coworkers. Secondly, the mandate is over.

The rule was that you only take a $100 bill when someone gases up for at least $50 or buys for at least $50 as a register only had 10 bucks in change and getting larger amounts out of the timed safe could take twenty minutes.    
I was talking to the manager about the graveyard shift I was about to finish when this new cashier came with a $100 bill and said she needed $98 in change.

Twas a normal day in bumfudge, nowhere. I'm running around the store doing everybody's job cause I work with a bunch of monkeys, and I decided I needed a bit of a break, so I go outside for a quick smoke. 

I watch as this lady pulls up to a parking spot. It's been pretty hot, the heat wave and all that, and I see she has a dog in the car. 

I wasn't going make a big deal of it, all right? The lady is a regular and she's in and out of the store in 5 minutes, 10 tops if it's super busy. I wasn't about to make her feel terrible for leaving her dog in the car while she grabs a bottle of booze. 

Well, apparently, I didn't have to. Because another regular, a ""functioning"" alcoholic, decided to say something for me. He's already had a few drinks, so he's already kind of belligerent. 

The lady comes back out and this guy just starts going OFF at her, yelling about how she's in animal abuser, about how she would feel being left in the oven all day, etc. Etc. 

Now, I will admit.... I am a bit of a drama llama. I was kind of excited to see where this went. But at the same time, it was kind of our responsibility, he got drunk off our booze that we sold him. 

Before I could step in, however.... And let me emphasize this, there was no CHANCE of me being able to do anything about it. 

This dude grabs the women's bottle she just bought and SMASHES it against her car. 

Glass flies everywhere, dog's going insane in the car, the yelling escalates to fisticuffs, people are starting to record, security is calling the police. 

But they're both in it to win it, alright? It was like Rocky, but without the gloves.

1164,happy 4th of july,"Yesterday, a guy comes in my store. I greet him, he nods and heads over to the medicine aisle. He grabs cough syrup, and I head to the register to ring him up. I scan the item and the register prompts me to ask for ID (for those who don’t know— you have to be 18 or older to buy certain cough medicines)

and for more context: my store has a very strict ID policy. We card everyone, regardless of if they look over 18/21. No ID=No Sale

He proceeds to get extremely mad at me, going “What the fuck? I have to have my fucking ID to buy fucking medicine? I’m 30 fucking years old are you fucking kidding me” to which point I’m desperately repeating I’m sorry, it’s store policy, certain medications require proof of age, etc. He storms out pissed, and he’s going so fast the sliding doors don’t have enough time to open all the way and he rams into it so hard with the side of his body that it’s knocked off the track and is completely unhinged. Thankfully my shift manager came out of the back room right then and was able to help me get it back on the track (also that night we discovered it would no longer lock from the inside; another shift manager was able to fix it the next morning though).

Anyways he comes back about an hour later. I greet him (I hadn’t noticed it was the same guy) and he looks at me, says straight to my face “fucking you again” and goes back to the medicine aisle. Oh boy, here we go again…

He comes to ring up, and I’m asking him several questions (if he has a card with us, etc) and he’s not talking to me. I ask for his ID, he tosses it to me and whatever, I get the birthdate and am able to ring him up. As he leaves I tell him to have a nice day and he tells me to fuck off.

Once it was time for people to pick up there units, I called everyone, let them know when they could pick it up and if they didn't, it would be thrown away on our last business day. I called everyone who hadn't picked up the last two weeks before we closed. Some were earlier depending on if the fixture was cleared out and i would always update the sheet when an attempt was made.

This particular lady, I called 7 times. First 3 times, her mailbox was full, 4-6 I left messages and the last time I spoke to someone who wasn't her, sounded like a granddaughter. 

She finally comes in the 2nd to last day. First thing she says ""you guys never called me to pick this up"" I correct her and say ""Actually I called you 7 times and left messages when your mailbox wasn't full""   she waves  me off and keeps complaining.

She gets to the fixture. ""This isn't the fixture I bought. I wanted to use this as a bookshelf and this is the whole reason I got it. You guys took the shelves off.""  Me: ""The only shelves this one had are in the back because it had bagged candy."" Her: ""no you're lying"" Me: "" I'm not, I worked in this section for 8 years, I know what this fixture used to be""

We keep going back and forth. I finally leave and grab my supervisor, he tells her the same thing(he also mainly worked in the department). Finally the GM comes over and just gives her 10 shelves which was about $10, he almost took them off another fixture before I told him that it was paid for by someone else. 

They had another fixture to pick up and were complaining that the shelves were dirty and we just shrugged. The liquidation company policy was that final sale, as is and you're responsible for loading it yourself. 

I hated them so much and was so happy when they left the store. When I ranted to my supervisor, he said the GM gave them the free shelving because the money from fixtures were going to another company and not the store we worked for so he didn't care.",0,1625549003

We have a challenge 25 policy for alcohol, cigarettes, lotto and energy drinks, and knives etc. 

Recently our shop had a strange audit. 

There was 3 shoppers in at a time. Buying different  age restricted stuff. 

For me I worked it out to be some girl buying paracetamol. She had no ID so I refused the sale. I passed. Two of my colleagues failed (one had an energy drink and the other a red bull). 

My questions are:
How strict are you guys on ID - does it depend on the good? Does it depend on your mood? When do you realise you may have to ask for ID (such as you see them in a queue). Finally is there any goods you don’t ID for that require ID. 

I’ve been told I’m too strict, oldest I’ve ID’ed is 31 but I assume if they’re under 25 and over 18 I can still get in trouble?",0,1625425809

1181,"Ma'am, that's not how it works.","Long time lurker, first time poster to this sub. I apologize for any errors. I'm on mobile. Sorry that its a little long.  

I am a manager in a fairly large and well known craft store in the US and Canada. I've been working there for 4 years now and I've had my fair share of headache inducing customers. A few days ago, I had one woman that takes the cake...
On Tuesday,  I was working on truck (putting new freight on the shelves) when a woman approached me. She comes in frequently and she's never the easiest to handle. Let's call her Karen.  
Karen approaches me. ""I have a question. ""
Me, putting on my best customer service voice and smile. ""Yes, ma'am? What can I assist you with?"" 
She proceeds to shove her phone into my face. ""The app says I will get my voucher within 72 hours of earning it. Its been 2 days! I want my voucher. "" 
""Ma'am,  72 hours is 3 days. Its only been 48. ""
""Well I purchased $30 worth of stuff Saturday! Where is it?""
""Ma'am,  I apologize but I can't do anything in store. You'll need to call the customer service line and they can help you. But it takes 72 hours for vouchers to update in the system and up to 10 days for them to come through your email or app."" 
""It doesn't say that!""
""You've asked us about it before and we've explained it before...""
She mumbles something about me being a bitch and walks off. 

20 minutes later, I'm in the kids section putting up glitter.  She sees the glitter glue pens. 
""How much are these?""
""$4.99"" 
She grabs 2 packs and thanks me. 

10 minutes later.
Cashier comes on the radio, ""can someone do a price check? Customer says these glitter pens are $1 but they're ringing up for $4.99."" 
I sigh and reply. ""I helped her. They are $4.99. Shes aware of this.""
Cashier - ""shes heading back there.""
Great...
Karen points at the $1 tag for items below the pens. ""It says here they're $1!""
""Ma'am,  they're $4.99. I told you that when you asked a few minutes ago...""
""This says $1!""
I grab the hooks with the $1 labels clearly attached. ""These are $1. Those are $4.99. The $1 is sold out. I apologize ""
""Then those should be $1!""
""No....? Those hooks clearly say they're $4.99...""
She then points lower on the shelf. ""What about these? It says $2 but nothing is there .""
""Yes, ma'am. That item is sold out  ""
She points at the $2 and moves up to the glitter glue 2 shelves up. ""Then these should be $2.""
""No... those are $3.""
""That doesn't make sense! It should go up to the next item up!""
""No. It is only for that item. Not ones above it.""
""Ive never heard of that before!"" She storms off. 

Not even 5 minutes later.
Cashier  - ""OP, can you come up front? She wants a manager...""
I walk up front, mentally preparing for the crap show I'm about to walk into.  She's glaring daggers at me. 
""I have some complaints about how you run this store. First of all, the signs are not clear!"" 
""Ma'am,  we have the same system as almost everyone else. Prices are on the peg for that item. Not above it.""
""A regular customer like me doesn't know that!""
Internally screaming and thinking ""everyone knows that.  My kids even know how it works....""
""Secondly, the sale sign over there says 40% off! They're 50%!"" 
Yes... she complained about the items being on better sale than stated...
""I'm sorry, ma'am. Corporate will sometimes have a higher sale for items for a couple days and we won't receive signs or be notified until we see it at the register. ""
""This is ridiculous! I'm going to shop at your competitor!""
""Sorry to hear that. Have a good day, ma'am. ""

1182,Gee I wonder?,"(Obligatory mobile) 
Here’s another top stupidest questions I’ve heard

I used to work in a shoe store and we would get a lot of foot traffic from people just coming through the strip mall. We sold lots of high dollar shoes, Jordan’s, other Nike’s, Yeezys on occasion, sometimes upwards of $250 so many people would try to grab something and run out, this is why we always had someone posted at the front door. We didn’t actually have someone hired as security, so me being the 6’4 large lanky man I am, I was usually the one up there. 

I was essentially in charge of both loss prevention, and greeting people when they came in and the “thanks, come again” when they leave. Mind you 3 out of 4 walls in this store are covered in shoes for display. Cue old white guy who looks like he’s worn loafers his whole life to peek his head in the door to say “do you guys sell shoes here?” Our customer base is a jovial bunch so I expected him to laugh and say “nah I’m just joking with ya” but nope, he was serious. I look around and say “yes we do” to which he replies “oh ok” and walks off. Didn’t even come into the store.

I worked at that store for about a year and a half and have many many more amazing stories, but in terms of stupid questions? That ones up there.",0,1625410013
1183,"Transferred to a new location, being harassed.","Hi,

I transferred stores a few weeks ago in a better area. I have been working for this company for a little less than a year. The manager of the new store manipulated me in a way to transfer and I agreed. 

First it started with my wage; At my old store I was paid more because of the location and the supervisor forced me to sign a paper that I get a decrease because of the new area. So I use a variation of my name in my tag and such but my I-9/W-4 forms have my ID name and she made a big deal about it... Since then I feel so frustrated. She acts like I lied for my name and the manager and my coworkers laugh about the matter... I am a foreigner so my name is written in a weird way that they cannot even spell. By using an English variation it made it so easy for everyone. I didn't even have such issues at my old store. Now the supervisor comes the time my shift begins and she makes a deal about it and she even tells me what my coworkers (mentioning names) complained about. I am so tired and stressed, I told them if they keep harassing like that, I will quit. I only stay there because of the insurance and full-time schedule.",0,1625401661

1185,'I calculated it myself so the register is wrong',"First post so I hope Im doing it right, English is not my native language.

&amp;#x200B;

So earlier this year I started working in a local grocery store so when this story happend i was still fairly new to everything and i wasnt wearing a headset at the time so if something were to happen id have to ask a colleague to call someone. Also we have extra screens that show the costumers the items that are scanned and their total and the registers are shared by two people facing away from eachother.

I already new the Lady this story is about, because the first time she was at my register she snatched the receipt out of my hand telling me to just put it down. So when I saw her in the line to my register again i knew i had to make everything perfect. 

She comes up and i start scanning her items (on a side note: she bought 100 cans of cat food haha and some other stuff) and i tell her the total. She looks at the screen, then looks at me and says that it cant be because she calculated it and the register is wrong. She then proceeds to recalculate the items in her head (probs to her i couldnt do this) and tells me the total she comes up with which is about 4€ less. Im kinda lost since, you know, if the register tells me the price i cant change anything about it.

In comes the manager of the evening who backs me up, after checking if I did everything right. The Lady still says it cant be and recalculates at least three more time. Asking for the mamager not knowing she is already there, the asking for someone higher up (it was late the manager was the highest person in the store). Inbetween she tells us she is going to take the receipt with her and she wants to have it. Me and the manager tell her she can have the reiceipt but she has to pay first. She actually took so much time with complaining and recaculating and everything, that another costumer in line offerd to pay the diffrence. She finally decides to pay, once again snatching the receipt out of my hand and she leaves. That was already a wild ride for me because she was the first really rude costumer I had but you know it happens (I know that now).

But the story doesnt end here, because the next time i work she comes up to my register from the oustide of the store (she wasnt shopping and came directly to me). I was scanning another costumers items and told her to wait and i was already looking for a way to get someone to help me if she gets rude again (since i wasnt wearing a headphone thing and i was alone in the register both). But I got a really pleasant surprise because she came up to alpologise to me, that infact she calculated wrong and the register was right and then she proceeds to tell me her life story (which i cut short, other costumers were waiting). And now everytime I work and she is in the store she comes to my register and is actually rather nice now.",0,1625395320

1196,How Do You Think It Got On The Shelf?,"So I'm working self checkout and a customer asks if I know the numbers for an avacado. Fair enough, no problem, let me put it in for you. Then as I always do I move the product into the bagging area because people get confused enough just doing things themselves. Now mind you, I didn't even touch the avocado directly. It was in a bag and twist tied shut so I just grabbed the top of the bag.

No one cares and life goes on. Well, since I have to bring it up that clearly isn't the case this time. The customer visibly recoils from the avocado and makes a big deal about not wanting other people to touch their food. Whatever, I take it off the order and then guess what? She pays with cash.

I'm sorry but what? Cash is a magnitude worse. Plus as the title says, how do you think it got in the shelf in the first place? Plus plus in the area where my store is located avocados make up a significant portion of the diet. Of all the produce, avocados are gone over like crazy. If she was able to grab it without having to wait for someone to get done with feeling every one of them I would be impressed.

Mind you, I can respect if someone has problems with some phobia or another. But I'm sorry, the free standing produce should be off your list if things to buy. That and they didn't tell me. I have had other who don't like people touching their food. Except those other people told me that ahead of time so I was careful to not touch their stuff. Because you know what? I touched more of this person's food just because I had to lean over to get to the station. Hell, I touched more of the avocado when I leaned over than I did when I picked it up because I just used a couple fingers for that. So yeah, I can understand having some hang ups, just tell me ahead of time.",0,1625262971
1197,"Lady picks on new guy for double-scanning items, upon inspection he actually missed an item and her total went up.","We have this one regular who likes to pick on new team members, she goes thru the newest cashier if she can, and always raises a stink until the manager (me) comes by to demolish her. She always leaves grumpy, so why does she keep shopping here? Who friggin knows

So she goes through J's till today.

He has been here for 2 weeks and is 1 week fresh on the register. He's doing great and so far has made every effort to understand the register, and he's been pretty independent!! He scans through her items, asks about the club card, offers a bag, and announces her total.

She then scoffs and says how can it be that much? J then jovially tells her that items can add up when you're in the zone, and repeats her total. She insists he scanned something twice, and not quite having faced a customer like this before, he calls me over for backup. After listening to her claim, I dutifully check each item's tag with the register's item list to satisfy her paranoid claim, all the while explaining to J how to handle a double-scanned item.

Wow, what a surprise! Ma'am, nothing was scanned twice, however it looks like J missed an item while scanning! Your new total is up by $15. Cash or card?

This woman stared at J and I for at least 5 full silent seconds before she started apologizing and saying her English was bad and she didn't understand what we were saying. I explained what happened a couple different ways, ensuring there was no conflict of communication, and each time repeated her heightened total.

Eventually she gave up, and paid the higher amount. She sulked on out of the store, claiming we always do this crap with her. Sorry lady, idiot tax is real!

P.S. I did discuss with J to be a little more careful and steady at cash going forward, to make sure he doesn't miss any more items, just in case this has been a recurring problem and not a one-off. I have high hopes for him going forward!!!",0,1625261548

1218,yay for having to wait to do an exchange.,"context: at my store, only those in managerial positions are able to process returns and exchanges. don't know why, probably something with the POS systems we use, but it's definitely a blessing in disguise as an hourly associate. one less thing to have to deal with. our store is also kind of in flux right now - the GM just left and we only have an AM and no leads.


so my manager was in the middle of an interview for one of the open sales lead positions when a lady came in asking for an exchange. I texted my manager to let her know, and let the lady know that she would have to wait. the lady said she didn't have time to wait. I told her that I would let her know as soon as my manager responded. it turns out I had had my data off the entire time so my text didn't send, but luckily my coworker who was also up front had texted her as well.


either way, the lady was fuming when she was still standing there five minutes later and complaining that our manager never trained us on how to process returns or the like. I understood her frustration, but also, if I personally needed to do something requiring a manager and heard they were interviewing, I'd know that there's a chance I'd have to wait a while. my manager did end up coming out soon after, and the lady was noticeably much nicer to her than when she was complaining about everything to me. at least the lady didn't explode on me or anything like that, though.",0,1625042793

1220,Glitch in the matrix ...?,"Another poster writing about what they couldn't control for the customer reminded me of this exchange, earlier this summer;

Working at a fine auto waystation with a 'Car Spa' (car wash, it's a little car wash) we get some people get confused as to how buying a wash is supposed to work.        You can pay three ways;

You can drive right up to the machine kiosk and use your credit card, but *only* your credit card and it can be a little tricky.

Most people either like to pay inside by cash, or they pay at the pump while they're getting gas.       This is easier and then they're given a code number on their receipt to enter at the kiosk, which will start their car wash.

The other day, an already inconvienced old man came to counter to say that his receipt didn't print out and therefore he didn't get his car wash that he had paid for.       This happens commonly enough that I know well that I can just call up the pump transaction on the register and reprint his receipt with his car wash code on it.       Naturally, the first thing I ask him is: what pump # is he at?

He replies, 'Nine! (9)' and repeats that number consistantly as we transaction tango.       The reason for the song and dance was- I wasn't getting any readout from pump #9.       Now, this can happen too; sometimes the network is slow; or sometimes it's just a glitch in the matrix.       Whatever, he was getting more and more upset that his car washing wants weren't being instantly gratified... and that was MY fault of course.        Regardless that I couldn't make the network connect any faster; he was going to send in a complaint and stormed off to his car in protest.

Now, it wasn't to busy so I looked out the window after him and noticed something strange- there was NO car at pump #9 and irate old man was headed to pump #8.
Well then, I called up the screen to pump #8 and there was his car wash code.       Printing it up, I even had a trainee run out there and give it to him, but he was still determined to be cranky.

anyways as i was ringing up some guy i start by saying “Would you like to buy $1…” and he immediately goes “NOPE” all rude …. my co workers even laughed and when i looked at them like “what?” they just mouthed (the guy who i was ringing” 

now usually i let people slide anything under $1 and especially if it’s needed like food,, 

he was buying to cartons of milk and was short .25 … 

he goes “Aw damn i’m short” 

and i said “Ok I can take one off” with the attitude he gave me 

and he goes “Aw really i needed the milk”

“And i say we’ll the bank don’t give you more or less than what you ask for so”

so i took one off and he paid and left Lol. 

tbh i would’ve let it slide but it’s the fact that people don’t have basic manners mind you he was probably like lately 30s and i’m in my 20s.",0,1624867289
1228,Much ado about serial numbers,"When I was working at a thrift store, I got this one customer who was quite...odd.  We'll call her ""Monica.""  She comes to the register to check out and I make some small talk and she puts her stuff on the counter.  Monica's total comes to about $10 and she fishes out a five and asks if she could make a partial payment and come back later to pay the rest.  I told her no (she's dressed like she could be homeless or something).  She then takes out a tiny stack of ones and asks to borrow a pen and a piece of paper so I oblige.

I then notice that Monica is writing down the serial numbers to all the one dollar bills she was using to pay.  This raised an immediate red flag so I ushered my Awesome Supervisor (AS) to the cash wrap.  AS takes a closer look at Monica and asks her why she was writing down the serial numbers on a piece of paper.  Monica replies that it would be ""proof"" that she didn't steal anything.  Eventually, after writing down the serial numbers to the money, I take the cash as payment but only before I checked them for counterfeits per AS.  I cashed out Monica and she went on her way, mumbling something about having to pay to get her clothes back or something.

AS then told me that she thought it might have been money laundering (I doubt it but it could happen). I then told AS that Monica writing down all those serial numbers wouldn't do anything because we would be giving that money away as change and her efforts would be worthless.",0,1624851430
1229,My phone was stolen. And I got it back.,"I work in a small neighborhood market. I've worked there for 3 years. I'm the woman who calls you honey, and will cover you if you're short. I've even used tip money to buy a pack of cigarettes or a couple of  beers for my favorite regulars if they don't have any money. Needless to say, I am adored.

I sat my phone down on the counter after sending a text and whet to help a customer. I got busy so I forgot about it. 

This is a year old android phone. It isn't worth all that much but I collect screen shots. I have over 5000 on this phone and they mean the world to me. My books, phone numbers and Reddit account are all recoverable but, my beloved screen shots are not.


A little later I went to grab my phone, and it was gone. I looked everywhere and my son, who was there with me, looked too. 

I called the bosses daughter and asked if she would come down and look at the cameras and she said yes. 

Freaking out I went to help a customer at the window. He is a well known neighborhood drug dealer but I am cool with him because, why not. He's a nice enough guy. I've even chatted with him when he rode past my house and I was sitting on my porch. 

I told him my phone was stolen and he said, ""I know exactly who has it. He's trying to sell it for $30."" 

I told him if he could get it back for me I would buy him a pack of cigarettes every week for a month.

He left and 10 minutes later the man I thought might have done it came walking in saying, ""I found this phone sitting outside.""

Funny because my son and my boyfriend were sitting outside and wouldn't they have seen it?

The bosses daughter would not confirm who it was. She called her mom and told her so the boss lady is gonna handle it but I know enough of the shady people in the neighborhood who I have helped out in the past won't let him get away with it. 

Also, yes I know it is completely my fault. My boss is always telling me to hide it under the counter and stop trusting people.",0,1624850038
1230,You just can't please some people,"I work retail at a hardware store where we have a ""greeter"" up front to assist customers as they come in. Our registers are also located next to the front door. 

A few days ago, the store was rather slow and I was up front working the register. An elderly lady approaches the front door, and she was walking using a a walker with wheels. The greeter at the time sees her, and promptly opens the door to let her in. She comes in, huffy that he opened the door, and says something along the lines of ""I could've opened the door myself"". She then informs him that she doesn't need help and she knows what she's looking for. The greeter apologizes and we shrug it off..no big deal. He then gets on the radio to notify the other sales associates that she doesn't need assistance, as we often do. 

Thirty or so minutes passed, and the woman comes into my line and I check her out. Since we switch off greeters each hour, a different sales associate is now standing up front. I check her out with no issue, and she makes her way to the door. The new sales associate tells her to have a good day. She simply glares at him and says ""you know, you could open the door for me instead of just standing there."" Taken aback, he apologizes and opens the door. 

I was appalled. After she left, the second greeter told me he would've opened the door but didn't as per the radio announcement of the other associate. She didn't have any large items, just a few small things in a bag that she was hanging from the walker. Usually I try and give people the benefit of the doubt, but I really have no explanation for her behavior. Some people are just not happy no matter what!

1231,I'm working for a locally owned business for the first time and it's so refreshing,"I just had someone in my store that was incredibly rude, dismissed everything I said despite me priding myself in being an expert in the product that we carry and definitely more educated than this woman. She continues to berate me, saying that our selection is poor and overpriced and we'll never stay open like this. All the while I just politely nodded with an understanding look on my face that we've all perfected working retail.

Then in the midst of her tirade she stops and looks at me and says ""How much money do you make here?""

Suddenly I had a realization. I've been in retail management for years. Anytime I didn't bend over backwards for a difficult customer there was always the chance they'd complain to corporate, corporate would reach out to my district manager, then suddenly I'm being written up because I couldn't fulfill some impossible request.


But there is no corporate here, just the owner. And when I got hired the owner told me, ""If anyone is disrespectful, threatening, or trys to pull some sh*t, tell them to f*ck off and get out.""


I took incredible pleasure in informing the customer that she was being incredibly rude and I was going to have to ask her to leave.


The only thing better was when she said ""How dare you, I want to speak to your owner""


""Ma'am, he's not here, he doesn't wish to speak to you and he'd tell you to f*ck off. Please leave.""",0,1624831745
1232,My one sided war with a customer over a bag,"To start, this is absolutely petty on my part. And I won't pretend it isn't.

I have a particular customer who comes in and gets 2 smaller items. Usually when its like this I don't default to asking if they need a bag. This customer stands there and waits until I ask them if I need a bag and they shrug and say, ""Sure."" dismissively. Like they weren't waiting for one and for me to ask.

I started recognizing the behavior from the customer and a couple of times if they came in, I'd just go and grab the bag without asking and they'd say, ""Nah I don't need it."" and leave. Even if they waited a minute. So I started getting annoyed about why they wouldn't ask for a bag. If I asked, they'd take it. If I didn't ask but grabbed the bag they wouldn't. But if I never asked or grabbed a bag, they'd wait. I was convinced they were messing with me.

So instead of being a normal person and just continuing to ask them for a bag, today I wanted to stretch the limit.

They came up to the counter when no one else was in the store and got a bottle of soda and a pack of gum and once they were rung up and paid, I waited. I washed the counter a bit, started stocking behind the counter and they just... waited. On their cellphone looking up occasionally. I started sorting stuff and cleaning up and they stayed there.

I broke after about 3 minutes and asked them if they needed a bag and they just shrugged and said, ""Sure.""

My white flag is out and I'm just gonna keep asking them for a bag.",0,1624821800
1233,Picking Up A Soaked Chair From A Hoarder.,"Where I use to work, my store delivered furniture. This was several years ago. We had a couple who bought a power reclining chair from us, and later the wife claimed there were sparks coming from the motor. 

So me and a coworker were tasked with picking up the chair from the customers place, and bringing it back to the store for the workers in the store to look it over. 

When we get there, it was a property in a trailer park, and their trailer was surrounded by garbage. Lots of old lawn equipment, long uncut grass. You get the picture. 

It gets worse. We enter the trailer, and what you see in hoarder documentaries are real. Stacks of news paper, garbage everywhere. The place had cats and dogs, smelled of urine and feces. 

Me and my coworker move over to the chair. It smelled a lot like urine. The man who sat in it was over weight, walked with a cane, so he had mobility issues. 

We move to disassemble the chair, and as I’m taking apart the back, I notice a stain on the floor that at first I thought was melted chocolate. But then I noticed there were fragments of toilet paper in it. I still hope it wasn’t what I thought it was, but it probably was. 

We get the chair into the vehicle, and as soon as we are in, my coworker happened to be carrying a little bottle of disinfected. We covered our hands, and used gloves to remove the chair from vehicle when we got back to the store. 

The people who looked over the chair sprayed that things multiple times with cleaners. They figured the guy who would sit in that chair was literally going to the bathroom in the chair, and the urine was soaking through the chair, and then dripping onto the motor, and that’s what was causing sparks. 

I don’t know what they told the customer, but we returned a week later to return the chair to the customer. This time, me and my coworker wore gloves, and still used disinfectant when we were done.",0,1624796559

I still refuse to believe this happened. So, a few months ago, probably just before the holidays, I had a customer come up to the station I work at. She looked at the case I was standing in front of, for probably 20 seconds, looked at the giant sign that I was standing under, that stated what department I work in. She bounced between doing the 2 for about 10 seconds. She then looks at me and says “is this the bakery?” I should mention, the case I was behind is clear glass and filled with meats to slice, The sign she was staring at, it says “Deli”, and I was cleaning the meat slicer at the time she asked me. And the giant kicker, the first sign you see when you walk into the store, is “Bakery” in giant bold lettering. I still don’t believe this happened. I know this is nothing compared to what some of you have seen, but I still laugh about it to this day.",0,1624769692

1238,Car wash Chad,"It's officially summer and that means BBQ's and car washes - which is a service my gas station provides.       (Well, just the washes)    It isn't much, just a car washing machine really, that you drive into and the brushes move around your vehicle.       Since there's no human labor involved; the price is pretty low, which is actually a good selling point.
So, it's a busy day with cars lined up to be cleaned and a customer calls the sales counter *from inside the car wash*.         The machine just stopped, he says, can I start it up for him again?

Unfortunately, this does happen, it's just an automated machine and not a smart device at that.         If people move their cars around in there while it's running, it will just turn itself off.      I inform the customer that it can't be re-started until he drives his car out of there and then the machine can begin the washing sequence again.        The good news is: In those cases I'm happy to give the customer a 're-do' code to start the sequence at no charge.       However, they still have to exit the car wash and start over.
This customer says he wants to back up out of the carwash; that is- exit through the entrance so he doesn't have to go all the way around.       (What!???)       No sir, I tell him, just proceed forward and exit the car wash, I have to give you the new code at the register.
Finally, he listens and frees up the car wash for all the other customers who've been patiently waiting their turn.       Two minutes later, he's at the counter and I have his new code number ready for him ...but he's still unhappy; now he wants me to direct everyone else to move aside so, he can get into the car wash first with no waiting.       With the concrete ramps and barriers; this would be highly inconvenient to the other customers but he's pretty upset that I won't do this for him.
In fact, he's upset that I didn't do that in the first place, since he's inconvenienced *himself* by messing around with the car wash.       
All I can say is, ""There's nothing I can do about that now, sir.""

Eventually he took his new code and left.",0,1624758081
1239,Trucker Damages Heater Unit.,"Tldr: Trucker backs into heater unit, saying we should have bumpers. My boss gives a perfect comeback.

So this happened maybe two or three years ago. Where I use to work, we had a set of double doors at the back of the store that was used for unloading trucks. About 3 feet from the doors was our stores AC/Heater unit. 

One of our trucks were running late, and when it arrived, we all stood anxiously at the back, waiting for him to back in so we can start unloading. I remember watching him out the back door, as he made 15 different attempts to line up his trailer. So I give up watching him because it was winter, and I was letting cold air in. 

Suddenly, we all hear this loud crash from both outside, and in the vets. I run out the back door, and look to see the driver had driven right into the heater unit, crushing the air intake and buckling the area around it. It basically made the unit useless, and it was the middle of winter, so we were without heat now. 

When the driver came out, and inspected the damage, he said angrily to my boss that there should be bumpers. My boss replied with the perfect come back. “In the 30 years that this store and heater has been here, not one driver has ever hit it.” 

The driver was quiet after that.",0,1624742014

Customer: ""I'm looking for maple syrup that doesn't have any sugar""

M: ""She's not in until later""

C: ""They just let you run around unsupervised?""

1244,Customer Annoyed By Music Playing In The Store. I Throw Logic At Her.,"I remembered this story when I was working my first retail job. The store was a large corporate store. They would have the store radio tuned into the local radio station. This station, would play the same tracks of music every day. Basically, you’d hear the songs, and by mid day, you’d hear the first song in the morning, and the whole thing would repeat. 

It drove me up the wall. I hated a lot of the music. It annoyed me as much as hearing the Let It Go song when it was a big thing. 

While I was working, I had a women come up to me, very annoyed. She was just bashing the music, saying how it was terrible music, and she should take her shopping somewhere else. 

I looked at her and said “It is terrible music, I agree. But at least you can leave the store anytime you want. I’m stuck listening to this the whole day.”

1247,Giftcard Lady,"I used to work at a big box golf store.  One day I was working the till and a customer and her husband came up to pay for some new shoes.  This was a long time ago so I can't remember the exact total, but the interaction went something like this:

Me: ""Your total is $122.73 with tax.  How would you like to pay?""

Lady: ""Giftcard please.""

Me: ""Okay."" Open my hand for the card as she hands it to me.

I noticed something immediately.  Our giftcards are green and this was black and prominently had the name of a local shoe chain store on the front.

Me: ""Ma'am, this is for LocalShoeStore, this is GolfStore.""

Lady: ""No, no.  The person at LocalShoeStore told me this worked anywhere.""

Me:  ""Okay, that seems a bit weird but I'll give it a go. "" 

Obviously it comes up denied.

Lady: ""Can you try again?  I specifically asked for a universal card and the woman told me this would work anywhere.""  

She was getting a little bit agitated now.

Her Husband: ""Are you sure?  This clearly says LocalShoeStore on it.""

Lady: ""Yes!""

Me: tries one more time... ""Yeah it got denied again, I can't do anything with this.  Do you want me to put the shoes on hold for another time or do you have another method of payment?""

Lady: ""No, card is fine.  But you better believe I am going back to that store and letting them know their cards don't work everywhere!""

I guess this was some sort of triumphant last ditch effort to save face and prove she was wrong.  Her husband looked at her confused.  She handed me a credit card and they left.  Not amazing, just a truly strange occurrence.  I gather the lady was looking for one of those universal giftcards that can be used at 5-6 stores under the same chain umbrella (we have several store cards like this in Canada), or perhaps one of those VISA or Mastercard pre-paid gift cards?  It just seems odd that LocalShoeStore would even be thought to carry a VISA or MC prepaid card, or even weirder that a chain golf store is affiliated at all with a medium-high-end shoe store.

So I had actually just taken one home the other night to pass on to a friend who requested large boxes for a backdrop to a play. I think that experience qualified me best to help this woman because I already knew what to do. We unloaded the squishmallows which were few maybe 6 at the most and put the bin on a cart and wheeled it outside. She was so stoked she couldnt believe we actually let her have the box. She thanks me as we loaded it into the car it took some dismantling and folding but finay it was loaded and ready to go.

I should be grateful, because there were no jobs during lockdown, but never has a job impacted my mental health so much. I am 24/7 anxious. I guess that’s retail.

Yesterday a grandma bought playing cards for her grandchildren and I put everything for her in a plastic bag, but she demanded a new one, because the one I gave her was wrinkled.

She snarkily said: ‘I know this bag has been used by someone before.’ I gave her a new one, but told her that all the plastic bags we get are delivered like that.

It’s a fucking bag.

Then she wanted more separate bags, for all of her grandchildren to carry their own toys. A government rule in my country has made it mandatory _for years_ to charge a few cents extra for bags. I was just doing my job.

This lady asked for the manager. I did not believe my eyes. A real Karen. If she didn’t demand so much and acted in a respectful manner, I would’ve just given the bag (like I do most of the time.)

But she didn’t and I don’t tolerate that. I’m not giving extra service if you’re going to be a bitch. There was a long queue, but I still got the manager.

The grandma lied to the manager and played dumb, but he noticed what was going on and said I was right. I told the grandma she was lying and she walked away without uttering a word. A customer complimented me, saying I handled the situation correctly.

At around 4:40, A lady walks up to the window. 

I didn't even get a chance to greet her before she raises her voice at me. 

"" WHY ARE ALL THE GAS STATIONS LIKE MAPCO AND SHELL OUT OF GAS?""

Me: I don't know, I don't work there. 

Lady : * getting more pissy* I know you don't work there. Why are they out of gas?!?!?!?!

Me: I don't know but we have gas. 

Lady : Well, I want 50. 

Me : Okay, what pump are you on?

Lady : * points instead of saying it * over there. 

* I can her loyalty card*

And surprise. Surprise. She pays with a 100. We had a fifty in the drawer so that's what she got. 

She looked like she got more mad when I gave her a fifty but I closed my till quickly and told her in the most passive aggressive way to have a good day.",0,1624633910
1260,Regulars Tear Up Store Over A TV Remote,"I work at a convenience store type place, we have a small spot where customers can drink beer and there’s a TV there. 9/10 of the people who hang out in there are generally regulars, folks who go in everyday for the last 3 or 4 hours were open. They are very obsessive with the TV. 

Well, Friday the remote got stolen. Friday night they come in and I tell them remotes gone. TVs not even on because I turned it off since the remote got snatched (Had to stand on a damn counter just to reach the buttons). Clearly they didn’t believe me because every one of them came up to me separately asking for the remote. It’s gone. It’s stolen. I can’t just magic up a new remote. 

Saturday they are upset because I’m “lying” and just “hiding the remote from them” because I don’t want the TV on. I only have it shut off at night when I’ve people coming in to watch tv but are t buying anything. So, they clearly did the logical thing to solve this problem. 

They started searching the store. They went into the kitchen, they went behind the counting for that room (where we keep single beers and some important stuff). They went into the dry storage area. They went into the fucking *managers office* and rummaged through her stuff to find the remote. They ignored me when I said they can’t be back there because “I’m hiding the remote from them”. 

Of course they were allowed to go into those places. They spent more time in the store than some of the employees so they get to do what they want, right? Plus the owner loves them, she wouldn’t mind them searching her office. 

I went into their drinking room and announced to ALL the customers that anyone who goes into employee areas will be asked to leave immediately, got a few arguments and then I added I will contact the police if an individual refuses to leave. That got them to stop. I don’t think they understood the remote was **gone** until yesterday when I had to scold a few of them for doing that on my coworkers shift a couple days later and (remind them they can not only get kicked out but banned if they keep doing that)

1263,The bomb scare and the windows.," In the midd 1970’s I worked for a large retail company in the North East of the UK, this was the time when the IRA where in full operation.

I worked in head office, one of the stores there had a position on the end of the street with three sides to it and large glass display windows all round, about 20 feet up was a canopy that went right around the end of the building and out about 20 out from the building.

Both stores where joined by a tunnel under the road between them as the other store was on the opposite side of one of the streets. Both stores had a basement and 4 floors.

So this day we get a bomb threat that there is a bomb in one of the stores, so all customers are escorted out the stores followed by the staff.

Once outside I stood with my back to the wall away from the windows so if there was a bomb and it went off I was in a safe place, the rest of the staff where all over the place in front of the windows.

I asked my fellow staff members to stand in the area I was in and told them if there was a bomb then the windows could be blown out and glass would fly every where and injure any one in front of the windows. Which they did!

One of the sales men was a good friend and I called him over to me, he asked why I called him, and then explained the situation to him and he joined us.

I was a false alarm there was no bomb!!

3 months later we had the same thing again, another bomb scare but this time when you went outside the building there was no one next to the windows, they where standing in safe zones or had walked up the street away from the buildings.

It would seam that word had got around the stores about staying away from the windows, and yes another false alarm, this happened about 4 times in total.

When people heard that it was me saying the windows could blow outwards I had quite a few pats on my back for that information from staff members.

The store was Binns Limited in Sunderland.",0,1624622752

I start scanning, and then they start freaking out that i’m touching their items (pre covid btw, 2017). i’m like i’m sorry but how am i supposed to scan your items if i can’t touch them…? They start yelling at me and saying that i shouldn’t be touching their items because its dirty. i was in total disbelief tbh cause how can people actually be like this? regardless if you have to shop in person or get delivery SOMEONE has to touch your items. Anyways it escalated to the point where i had to get the manager (who hated me for no reason btw, just general pettiness of management) and she TOOK THEIR SIDE. i was already crying at this point from the frustration i was like really??? i had to go in the back to cool off. in the end they got a discount which is on a whole other level of stupidity. idk if they were purely crazy or just looking for a discount but it was pretty traumatizing. thank god i never saw them again…",0,1624589978
1266,"""She made me buy the candy bar and I hate candy!""","This was back when I was working at my local grocery store. It was in a lower income part of town if that helps set the scene in any way.

Our store was having a bit of a promotional. Everytime someone bought something a $5 off coupon would print out with the receipt. It was one coupon per customer per order and they had to spend at least $5 before the coupon would even go through.

Well one day this older gentleman walks up to the cash register with his little handful of items. It all rings up to about $4.35. He then hands me the $5 off coupon. The following conversation went a bit like this:

M: oh sorry i cant use that right now. You have to have at least $5 worth of stuff before that can go through. Is there anything else you want?

G: no this is it. I dont want anything else. Just use the coupon.

M: i cant use it until you reach $5. We sell bags for $0.11 if you want some of those?

G: no i dont want any bags! I just want what i have and for you to use the coupon!

(Now i know i could have probably just charged him for the bags so the coupon would go through, but i hate charging people for things that they dont end up taking with them. Slightly feels like stealing. So i decided to try some other things.)

M: how about one of the candy bars? Itll be enough to push you over $5.

G: *huffs and grabs the closest candy bar and hands it to me*

M: *scans the candy and coupon. He ends up being $0.23 over. Transaction proceeds as normal minus the grumpy attitude of the dude.*

G: *after recieving change proceeds to chuck it into the back of the room* I dont like chocolate bars!

The guy rants about it to himself for a minute before my supervisor came over to ask what was wrong. He told her that i wouldnt use his coupon and that i forced him to buy candy and he doesn't even like it. She then turns to me and tells me i should have just charged him for bags....",0,1624560414

1272,Lady (probably) broke out of mental hospital and tries to take me home,"This happened today, literally a few hours ago and I'm still a bit shaky tbh.

So for a little bit of context, this lady apparently tried to buy a few items before my interaction with her. She went through self scan and apparently didn't have enough money to pay for her stuff, so she said she was going to go to the gas station to get money from their ATM (there's a bank literally right next door from us with an ATM). She came back an hour later and loaded up her carriage with more stuff, and then came to the front. She started scanning her new groceries and came up to me wondering where the items she didn't pay for last time were. I had no idea what she was talking about because I wasn't there an hour ago. She pointed to one of the self scans and said she left them ""right there,"" and when I asked her when that was she said ""about an hour ago."" I thought it was strange that she would assume her groceries would stay at the same self scan for a WHOLE HOUR, but didn't think much else of it. I found her suspended order on another register and brought her the bag.

Me: Are these your items?

L: ...I'm so confused.

Me: ...Are these not yours? You said it was Ritz Crisps and that's what's in the bag.

L: ...There's items missing.

Me: There are? Well, what's missing?

L: ...I'm so confused.

I look at the suspended order slip and sure enough, all the stuff on the slip are in the bag. I tell her this, and she repeats ""I am so confused,"" and then says it's fine, she doesn't want them anymore and goes back to scanning her groceries. Ok, whatever.

As she's scanning her groceries, my manager comes up to me asks if the ""woman in the white nightgown"" is still here. I didn't really notice what this woman was wearing, but once he asked me that I was like ""huh, that lady was wearing something strange, wasn't she?"" I look at her, and yep, that's her.

Anyway, she pays for her stuff and starts to leave. 

L: Thank you so much, honey!

Me: Oh, you're welcome!

L: Now, are you gonna go home with me?

Me: Haha, no. I gotta stay here, I have a lot of work to do!

Lady: ...So you're not coming home with me?

Me (still thinking she's joking): Nah, they need me too much over here.

Lady: I'm being serious. You don't need to stay here, you can come home with me. Let's go.

Me: Y-You are? Um, it's fine, really. I still have a long ways to go of my shift.

Lady: What time are you here until? I'll come pick you up.

Me: ...I'm here all night.

Lady: All night?

Me: Yep, *all* night!

She keeps asking me what time I'm working until, and I keep responding with a jokingly cheerful ""I'm here all night!"" praying to GOD she'd just leave. She makes a weirdly threatening comment along the lines of ""Well I really hope you are here all night, then."" Then she gets quiet and stares at me. An unblinking, see-through-your-soul stare. Now I'm really starting to get nervous, so I tell her to have a good night and walk away to do work. 

She continues to stare at me for, like, three minutes, and then goes up to a hand sanitizer pump and starts pumping hand sanitizer into her hand while staring at me unflinchingly. Two coworkers of mine saw our interaction and they're keeping an eye on the woman. I start thinking ""I'm going to give her one more minute, and if she doesn't leave by then then I'm going to call someone to remove her from the store."" Thankfully she FINALLY leaves. I go up to the two coworkers who saw the interaction and they were like ""Wtf, do you know her!?"" apparently one of them thought I knew her because of how I handled it, lol. But yeah, because I'm really bad at noticing what people wear, they inform me that she wasn't wearing a ""nightgown"" but a HOSPITAL GOWN, and apparently even a hospital bracelet!

I mean, I could be wrong. Maybe she got released, but I don't think they would release her wearing the hospital gown. And she definitely wasn't, um, well enough to be released. Anyway, that was definitely the scariest customer interaction I ever had. But I feel sorry for her, she's not ready to be out in public like that. Apparently a customer told the manager that they were going to call the police but I don't know if they did.

I told a few other employees the story and they were all like, ""was it the woman in the hospital gown?"" I have *no idea* how I didn't notice she was in a hospital gown. I hope she gets the help she needs.",0,1624499975
1273,Woman tries to have me arrested for stopping HER from shoplifting,"I (19F) work at a large craft/retail store and it was almost closing time. I was at a register waiting for stragglers to check out, and had my back towards the exit, which is right behind the registers. There was nobody coming up, so I was looking around, and I noticed a woman walking quickly behind me towards the exit. By the time I saw her she was already turning towards the doors and walking into the foyer which leads to the outside entrance, and I only saw her back and a little of her side, enough that I noticed her arms were crossed over her chest like she was holding something against it. I didn't much of it, just yelled ""have a good night!"".  

I guess she was so focused on getting out of the store she didn't notice me standing there, so when I spoke to her she startled really badly and dropped what she was holding. It was a little vase that cost like 10 dollars. So immediately I walked towards her out into the foyer (I don't know why she stayed there, she could have just booked it and I wouldn't have followed her) and I asked her if she was planning to pay for the vase (kind of in a snarky way, but it was late and I was too tired for this bullcrap). She got huffy and said yes, so I picked up the vase to bring it to my register and check her out. 

I don't know if that set her off or what, but she suddenly got PISSED and snatched the vase away from me. She said ""I PAID for this"" and then started talking some bull about my dirty paws being all over her property. I already knew what this was gonna turn into, so I went to the registers and picked up a phone and paged for my manager. A couple of my coworkers came up to the registers and she started talking to them about how I had tried to steal her property and accused her of shoplifting, and yelled at her. They all knew she was lying already because I'm a very quiet, shy person, and I've never raised my voice let alone yelled at someone at work. The lady started telling my coworkers to call the cops, and also started saying that I had physically cornered her and that she was afraid for her life. Now this woman was tall and pretty broad, and I'm average height/thin, so she's a good 5-6 inches taller than me and much bigger besides height. There's no way I could have intimidated her that much. 

My coworkers and I just let her carry on until my manager got there, and it turned out that he had been suspicious of her earlier and had been checking the cameras. When she tried to start her bullcrap on him about having me arrested and stuff, he already knew she didn't pay for anything and told her to leave and stop harassing his employees. She told him that she would be calling cooperate, he said go ahead, and she stormed out after that. The kicker of this whole thing was that she was wearing what seemed like expensive clothes and nice jewelry, and when we watched her leave it was in a car that looked pretty new/expensive. And she was trying to steal and make a big fuss over a little 10 dollar vase? When she obviously has the money to afford many of them? I hate customers like this",0,1624485620
1274,Things like this just leave a bad taste in my mouth.,"I work for the company that employs electricians for small jobs. Part of  my job is to answer the phone, take their information, type a quick  summary of the job, and then open the work order for the electrician,  which they will then use to contact the client and do the requested  work. 

It's summer, and the guy who does the billing is on vacation, which means I get to answer a second phone and write invoices for simple jobs, to ease his workload when he gets back.

I get to work, and phone starts ringing. A client introduces himself and wishes to talk about a invoice he received, about work that was done earlier this month. As he is giving me the information, I pull out the information about the invoice in question. The job our company did seemed pretty straightforward; air conditioning system, with a thermostat.

So I ask, ""What seems to be the problem?""

He starts, by telling me, ""The amount hours done by your electricians, does not match to the amount that being billed and there are some items on the invoice that were not used during the installation.""

This does happen sometimes. I ask that he lists all the items that were not used, and so that I can correct the bill, by double-checking with our electrician. After listing all the items, I ask him ""And what about the hours?""

He answers, ""I did most of the preparations myself, and your electrician only had to do the coupling of the thermostat and the motor that runs the air conditioner."" He does give me his estimate, for how much he thinks he should be billed about the work done. The amount is nowhere near what our electrician reported after finishing the job.

This is getting more and more complicated, so I inform him that I will be contacting the electrician, who was at the scene, and our boss about these inaccuracies, and that I would be contacting him after getting all the information.

After few calls and and some digging through our filing cabinet, I finally have some context. Apparently The client had visited our location when the work order was written and he was given an estimate about all the costs, work and material costs included, which he had agreed to. As per an agreement, the invoice was sent to reflect that amount. Though what he failed to mention during his phone call with me, was that the electrician was not informed about his homemade wiring work. So our electrician had to double-check, which after doing so, had to redo some of the wiring. The electrician also told me, that the client had basically been breathing down his neck the whole tiime, slowing his work.

After talking with my boss, I was told to remove the items he claimed were not used, which were nowhere to be seen in our shop, and our electrician was confident that they were actually used during the installation. The hours that were billed however, were another story.

Apparently the hours electrician had reported, after finishing the job, were already ""adjusted"" so that we were able to meet the estimate, which the client had agreed upon. I was told that I could reduce the hours on the invoice by one, but no more than that,

So I do some calculating, and redo the whole invoice. I can already tell that the phonecall is not going to go over well with the client.

I call him, explaining the amount amount he agreed to, when he made the work order. I was actually waiting for him to get angry, maybe even vent his frustration, but he sounded dejected.  This is just speculation on my part now, but he sounded more sad than angry.

That phone call lasted for about 40 minutes. He tried to make his case about all the preparation he had done, and how that should count for something. I informed him that we were willing to go under the agreed amount by removing the few items from the invoice and reduce the hours by one, but that was it. We had his signature on the paperwork and even doing this much is more than we would usually be willing to do.

So he tells me how he heard that our company was fair, and how our services were recommended to him because of that. At the end he told me that he would never recommend our services to anyone, and how disappointed he was about all this. I didn't really know what to say to him after all that, so the phone call ended after I simply told him that the revised invoice would be mailed to him, in a week or so.",0,1624467473

1280,Never Satisfied Customer,"Here's a retail story, but also I'm asking for advice.

I've been working for this ice cream shop for about 3 years now. In the first year, one day, I was working drive thru. I was taking this lady's order, but she was being complicated. She asked for two strawberry smoothies with extra sugar ""wtf"". I don't know whatever. I repeated her order and she cut me off saying ""I didn't say banana"". Thing is I didn't say banana either. I repeated her order twice exactly what she was telling me, but she was telling me that's not what she ordered. I was over it so I just told her ""okay I'll have your amount at the window"". She's at the window now I take her money hand out her smoothies and she's upset.

C=Customer Me=Me

C: ""Where's the whipped cream"".

Me: ""Sorry you didn't ask for whipped cream""

C: ""No, I come here all the time, your smoothies come with whipped cream and a cherry""

(whip cream is an add on, it's not included for any of our smoothies)

(also I worked 40+ hours a week, first time I've encountered her)

Me: ""Whipped cream would be an extra charge""

C: ""Where's your manager""

Me: ""I'm the manager""

C: ""No I want to speak to someone else""

Well ""luckily"" the night manager came in for night shift. I was done with her so I asked him to talk to her. This is where I became very upset, which I don't know still till this day if I was wrong to feel so upset about it. Well he talked to her, he remade her items and he sent her out with coupons for free desserts ""for the trouble"". She didn't deserve any coupons, I gave her exactly what she order. The most we should have done for her was remaking the smoothies and adding whipped cream with no charge, just to get her out of there. But not free desserts!! I expect coworkers to have each others backs when the customer is in the wrong. Not throw them under the bus!

This happened 2ish years ago. I left the company for a few months. When I came back I only worked 5-10 hours a week every other week or really month. Then at the beginning of this year I decided to add more hours (15-20hrs).

About a month ago I saw her again. I didn't recognizer her, but I recognized her order. She was at our front window this time so I saw my coworkers handing out her items. She sent her items back to be remade. She just looked at them, said there isn't enough of anything in them. She ended up asking for a manager, she talked to another manager on shift. My coworker remade her smoothie TWICE before she was happy with it. After she left I started talking about the incident I had with her 2 years ago. My coworker told me they have to make her order over every time she comes. I told my coworker that, that needs to stop. It's a waste of our time and our product.

Now to the end of the story!

Cut to last night! Once again I noticed her order on the screen. If she was going to complain, we weren't going to remake anything. She either takes it as is or we give her her money back and she gets nothing. Well I was telling my coworkers this when I was watching a different coworker hand out her order. She ended up asking for a manager, a coworker who has worked for the company longer than me stepping up trying to help her. She didn't want to talk to him asked for someone else so he gave her the GM managers name. She left, we didn't have to remake anything, yay. I asked him what she wanted a manager for.....He said she was accusing me of calling her dirty word...

1. What word!??
2. The customers are outside while we are inside handing out orders through windows. So she can't hear anything that was said if it was said.

He said she came the night before as well and he had the same problems. He was going to notify the GM about her.

I reply.  If you don't want any help, that's fine! I don't make commission anyways. But at least have manners and treat sales people like human beings.

So, I am in the middle of helping other customers when I hear a small smash in the background, and I see her in my peripheral vision bend down to pick something up. Everyone else was preoccupied but I already had a strike against this woman in my mind so I was paying attention. I wait for her to say something and she doesn't.

It was at that moment I had a sneaking suspicion about what this ADULT customer was going to do: she was going to hide it. Either in her own belongings or somewhere in the store. It was only a matter of finding it. Later she approaches my coworker, asks some stupid questions, picks out a product, and finishes browsing the store. She approaches the register as I am making my rounds looking for this broken item, trying to remain discreet and composed. I find the pile of the broken glass bottle in the back corner of the store, on a shelf, behind random product. I am in such shock that she actually did it that I burst out laughing, I couldn't contain it anymore. She turns and looks at me and we just stare at each other. She knows I know. I give her one last sideways look and muffle my giggles until she leaves the store. We don't even have any ""you break it/you buy it policy"" for customers or employees. At that point the damage was already done. And I didn't want to escalate the situation by confronting her. But all she had to do was tell us so that our lives could be easier and I wouldn't have had to go on a hunting excursion. Apparently that's too much to ask of some people.",0,1624375975

1288,Which Would Make You More Upset?,"If someone knows a better subreddit for this story please let me know. 

This happened years ago. I’m a Shift Manager for a retail drug store chain. 

One day another shift manager sees 2 girls, both about 14-15 years old walk into the women’s bathroom with a pregnancy test. She knew they hadn’t paid for it so both of us go into the bathroom to confront the girls. We’ll call them Blond and Brunette. 

When we walk in we catch Blond handing Brunette a pregnancy test from underneath the bathroom stall. The following conversation happens. 

Me: You need to pay for that? 

Blond: Can’t we use it then pay for it?

Me: No! Buy it then use it. 

Blond knocks on the stall telling Brunette she needs some money. Brunette hands Blond her wallet. I tell Blond to go with the other manager. I step outside the bathroom that way I can guard the bathroom door and see the cash register at the same time. Once I see the transaction end I leave my post. 

We keep our eyes on the two until they leave. 

That night I come home and tell my boyfriend about the potential theft. My boyfriend starts to chuckle and says “can you imagine the parents if you had called them? Your teen has been caught stealing, and she might be pregnant. Which is more unsettling?”

So just wondering here. As a parent, if this was your child, which is more upsetting? The theft or the potential pregnancy?",0,1624334547

Me: Yes?

Lady: Are all your ferns this expensive?

Me: The price is listed on the tag, but otherwise yes.

Lady: None of them are sale?

Me: Our stuff doesn’t go on sale till August. 

Lady: -wringing her hands worriedly- They’re so expensive, I could get them somewhere else cheaper.

Me: -assuming she was just making a statement- Okay.

I went back to the customer I had been helping before as we discussed the care of her plant. Lady stood behind me still staring with this same worried expression on her face like her cat just ran up a tree. 

Lady: They’re so expensive... -still wringing hands- 

Me: -clicks she’s probably looking for a deal- Okay. 

She paced back and forth for a while after that in the garden area. Going back to I assume look at the prices of plants before eventually wandering back out.

1313,Angry man just needs someone to yell at,"The first episode of this dude happened months ago just before spring broke. He came up to the curbside pickup and called in. He wanted to pay his charge account off. My store sells to contractors who often have an account they charge to then pay off every few months. I load the account and open the tab to see his balance and innocently thinking I'm just moving the process along say his balance is x dollars. 

For ten minutes this grown man works himself up going on about how it should actually be y dollars not x. I let him run out of steam and say "" I was just saying the balance on the screen you can just pay what you want."" 

Then he goes off for another 10 minutes yelling about this computer system and the sales rep and prices. 

And so I say ""sir they don't pay me enough to listen to yelling. If you have a problem just call the sales rep. You can literally just pay y dollars. Or any amount. Toward the account. Not to be rude but I don't care. I'll just take your payment. Or not. You choose. But stop shouting on my curb.""

And he had to do this wind down where he yelled but it was yelling back at me everything I had just said back at me in this way as if he was coming up with it. And his final missive as he stood out front of my store on a Saturday morning was to yell that he wouldn't pay jackshit today. And got in his van and went away. Chalked it up to the winter and pandemic making everyone a little wound up and forgot it.

Episode 2 was coming in recently now that we're open to the public. Buddy asks for the balance which i told him was 63. He gets this oh really look on his face and begins with ""THEN TELL ME, then tell me WHY the mail that come to my house says 55."" I say idk I'm just reading the balance you can pay 55 if you want. At every step he seemed to just miss this key fact. He could pay or not. It didn't matter. It wasn't blocking more charges to the account. He wasn't getting collections calls or near the 30/60/90 days. He could have walked in and said I wanna put 55 on my account and done that and gone home to what must be a lovely house full of joy.

Gets his sales rep (who sounded just exhausted lol) on speakerphone to say ""man just pay 55 if you want."" Dude gets all ""Aha aha! What now! I win"" as he spends a couple minutes ranting to wind himself down. Going on about how he understands I ""can't do nothing about the screen"" in this insane sounding misunderstanding of technology as I process his banal 55 payment I didn't care about not once.

Mister You can pay whatever you want I'm not a bouncer saying You Must pay the whole thing or the cops show up. What the hell. Angry man just wanted someone to yell at and customer service workers are stuck in a position where they have to de-escalate and tolerate.

So my family and I were at Disneyland and it was our last day, so we were doing some souvenir shopping. As I was looking around in the Bibbity Bobbity Boutique, this middle aged gentleman walked up to me with a toy and (because apparently my everyday clothing looks like a period fantasy costume? ) started asking me questions. 

MAN: Excuse me, how does this toy work?

ME: Oh, if you just hold down on the castle turret, Tinkerbell lights up and spins around. See? (I demonstrate)

MAN: Ah. And how much does it cost?

ME: (Checks tag) It looks like it's $14.99

MAN: Alright. And can you ring me up, or do I need to stand in line?

ME: Oh, I don't work here, I just happen to know the answers to your questions. 😊

He gave my outfit a once over, laughed, apologized (I assured him it was no trouble), and went on his merry.

1316,Money can't buy intelligence,"Couple years ago I was working in a petrol station. We had air machine to fill your tyres, which operated by inserting a token you could buy from the counter.

A middle-aged, very well dressed man comes in and asks for air token, I sold it to him and he went out to fill his tyres. One token lasts around 6 minutes, so that should be plenty enough for 4 tyres and then some. He comes back after couple minutes and states, that our air machine is broken. Okay, fair enough, that happens quite often, but even more often people don't know how to use it. (You insert a token, set your PSI and fill your tyres, super simple stuff, but people are idiots). 
Went with him to the air machine and asked what was the problem. What he does next, I just couldn't believe. He inserted token, set his PSI, took the nozzle and just stands there holding it. I was about to ask what he's waiting for, but he said angrily ""see, it's not inflating!""

I was absolutely shocked, that man thought that tyres fill up with Bluetooth or magic after inserting the token.",0,1624117720
1317,Some people are just never happy,"This was back at the very beginning of the pandemic. Social distancing and masks had been required for a few weeks to a month I think. My store had changed from multiple lines to only one line with social distancing. We didn’t have plexiglass yet and could only have 2 registers open. 

I was on first register and my coworker on the other. Both of us were trying to get through the line and go as fast as we could with transactions. But people kept coming in, so the line was still very long and slow. My coworker left the register for a few minutes to take care of some important thing that I don’t remember now. It was just us two and the managers; all of the managers were busy. 

By the time the customer got to my line, it looked like I was the only person working. So, like any normal human being would do, he yelled at me for being slow. He complained for 5 minutes about the line being too long and too slow. He kept saying he knew I was trying, but it was still unacceptable. Now, I’m not the slowest cashier. I’m pretty fast and get most people in and out if they’re willing. 
He was not willing.

The irony of him complaining about me wasting time with each customer at the register and holding the line up… while he was wasting time and holding the line up to complain about it. It still frustrates me. He took so long yelling at me and kept going even after multiple apologies and thanking him for his patience, that I started scanning his items while listening to him ramble. When he finally stopped ranting, I asked him if he had a rewards number. There were problems with his rewards number and it took a few minutes of back and forth with it. Basically he was missing information for his account.

Without going into too much detail: he mumbled a lot, so I needed him to repeat himself a couple of times. And he ended up saying the famous line “I’ve been coming here for 17 years and pay good money here!”. Which is weird because I had worked there for almost a year at that point in time and never saw him once. And if he truly had been a regular to any of our stores, there wouldn’t have been any missing information for his account. 

After finally fixing his rewards account so that he could get like $3 saved, he glared into my soul and said “See? You did something wrong.” And left. My coworker returned and I called the next person in line. The next person was so sweet. She said so many nice things, like that the previous guy was a jerk and that she wanted to let me know that I did a great job. 

That’s when I couldn’t hold back the tears in my eyes. I had my coworker cover for me and had a power cry in the break room for about 2 minutes. I got back to work and pretended nothing had ever happened.

I’m still working there and have never seen that guy return.",0,1624093605

1319,Customer threatens to call police on me because I cannot refund a phone minute card,"I have been a longtime lurker, and after six years of working in the same store, I have plenty of stories. So many. However, the one that I would like to start sharing with you is a simple one, although one that makes me want to punch many walls out of pure frustration.

I work in a small general store. I've been at this particular store six years, I have been a key holding manager five, and I have been assistant manager for over a year. Needless to say, I have seen and experienced some shit. But, this? This isn't the craziest, but hooboy, it's seared in my memory of one of the most annoying shifts I have ever worked.

It's our busiest day of the week, and I have been at the store since six am and I have just gotten off of break at 12 noon. (I promise this is important. Remember this.) As soon as I walk out, my cashier looks at me and goes, ""Hey, I have an issue with a return and I'm not sure what to do."" No problem. She's developing a line, so I instruct the customer with the return to move to my register so I can help him while the cashier continues to check out the customers waiting in line. This is something that happens often, and I'm chill with it. I would rather take care of it myself than have someone who isn't sure how to proceed deal with it. If we were slower, I'd have them watch me to learn, but as it's busy ---- I'll just take care of it and move on.

It's the Saturday before Memorial Day, and my plan was to start setting up displays of grilling supplies, cases of water, our Memorial Day flowers, etc. Things people would be looking for during the week to prep for the weekend. Alas, I had no idea I would be spending the next two and a half hours of my shift dealing with this customer.

He and his wife are both regulars, and they are the kind of customers that when they come in, you know there's going to be an issue. They believe they are entitled to anything they cook up in their little heads, and if they don't get their way, the threats come out. They're just.... exhausting. They are also far too familiar with our return policy. A policy I say every time we sell something that could pose an issue, or is a special case. Like cellphones. Sir is here with a cellphone return. Ah, the headaches. Here they come.

He has bought a the issuing company cellphone for his ""birthday"", and it will not work. He explains that he had activated it, but it states there is no SIM card. I'm like, alright, let's see if I can just fix the issue without having to process the return. Customer has a working phone, and everyone is happy. I go through his settings, and sure enough, I get a pop up: No SIM card detected. Open the phone. SIM card is there. Maybe inserted wrong? I take it out, make sure it's right and put it back in. No SIM card detected. Okay, cool. I explain to him that I do not have another phone like this in stock right now, and he demands a refund. Coolio.

I start the return (which deactivates the phone), and he informs me that he also wants a return on the minutes he bought for that phone. I explain that I cannot process that return, and that it says so on the receipt. I show him, and this... is when it starts to get loud. There are about ten people in line currently, and seven of them are behind him when he raises his voice and says, ""If you won't give me my money back, I'll just call the police. They'll get me my money back."" (Hindsight is 20/20. I should've just told him to call. Would've saved me some time, lmao.) I start to talk to him, he just talks over me louder, demanding that I give him his money back. I try one more time with the most polite voice I can muster, and once again, ""I am calling the police right NOW.""

""Sir, if you would calm down for one second and listen to me, you would understand that I am trying to help you solve this issue. Would you like me to call the issuing company to see if we can fix the phone so that there is no issue to be had?""

Sudden attitude change. Probably because I damn near had to yell it to be heard over his tomfoolery. He obliges me and I go outside to call the issuing company. We have to reactivate the phone. Fine. cool. Shoot a message to my Store Manager to let her know my till will be short, but the money doesn't exist since the return was never processed, I just needed to reactivate the phone through our system. Cool. We good. Try to reactivate his phone. (One hour has passed. My relief has arrived as well as the night cashier by now; also important.) Sir bothers me the entire time about how long it's going to take, I inform him that he can either wait or take the phone and deal with the issuing company himself. He chooses to wait. Duh. Still no luck. I explain to him that they're trying to reset the connection with the towers. Wait thirty minutes, turn the phone off, and try to make a call. He nods and leaves.

Freedom! ................Not quite.

Thirty minutes later, Sir is back. He claims it still isn't working. Alright, did you turn it off and back on like I instructed you? No. Okay, we do that. Still doesn't work. I inform him there is nothing more I can do for him, that he needs to call the issuing company himself and get it sorted. Once again he starts to raise his voice, and I cut him off, ""Sir, I have been attempting to fix this issue for you for two hours now, it is time for me to go home. I. Cannot. Help. You. You need to contact the issuing company."" He reluctantly shuffles away.

Only for his son to come back in the next day and tell me he needs a new SIM card. Something I would have suggested had the man given me time to speak. I sell him the SIM card for a dollar, and what d'ya know? It works! How amazing. Sir comes back in because he forgot all of his phone accessories, and I give him the bag. He thanks me for being a big help, and here is where... I maybe get a little facetious because I respond with, ""Of course, no problem. But, next time, I will not help you if you threaten to call the police on me ever again.""

He claims he only threatened that because ""that boy"" aka my night cashier got an attitude with him. I pause, stare at him for a moment before replying, ""Sir, when you threatened me with that, he wasn't even here. His shift did not start until 12:45 and he was not in the building until 12:30. Just have a good day, alright?"" He didn't respond, and I went back to work. Which I know sounds very ..whatever but it's an approximation of what I said. Remember, I came off of my break at 12, and I remember being outside on the phone with the issuing company when my night cashier walked through the doors. The only thing he said to Sir was to ask him to please stop making a scene inside the store because I was outside actively trying to get his phone to work. (I have no cell service inside my work building, therefore I had to be outside to take care of everything so that my store phone would remain open for customer calls.)

And, I'm still just so confused as to how he thought the cops were going to get his money back when the receipt clearly stated: NOT VALID FOR RETURNS, REFUNDS, TRANSFERS, AND HAS NO CASH VALUE underneath the PIN number.

I swear I love my job. Maybe I'll be back with some of the other craziness I've experienced. Like the crazy clothes thief, the battery thieves dumb enough to tell me they were banned from another store, or perhaps the two people who tried to get me fired. Oh! There's also the drunk naked lady that accused me of hitting on her boyfriend. While I was stocking charcoal. Fun times.

1322,The fitting rooms are closed for a reason!,"So, I work in a big brand clothing chain, but a smaller store. Today, I was asked to tidy around an area of my shop, and this area is known for being the messiest and having dumped stock all over it because it's home to the best mirror. As I started tidying everything away, my manager came over to me and started to tell me that she'd just spotted two women who used to go into her old shop all the time and swap the tags from cheaper garments onto more expensive ones so that they'd get what they wanted for significantly cheaper. She pointed them out and asked me to keep an eye, which was easy because they were at the mirror every 2 seconds. 

I carried on tidying the area when another woman, let's call her Pam, came over to the mirror and started trying clothes up against herself. Now, it's important to note, we have intermittently had our fitting rooms open, provided the shop is not busy and there are ample staff to keep on top of sanitising each room after they've been used, as well as disinfecting garments of clothing after they've been tried on.

When it's busy, they are closed, and all staff are on the shop floor in order to help customers as best as we can, keep the shop tidy, and put the returns and dumped clothing back in the right places. We allow people to try on jackets, shoes, button-ups, etc and just ask they are left behind the till if they're not wanted so we can disinfect them. Sometimes, people will try bits and bobs on without our permission and it isn't the end of the world, we just tidy around after them and complain about it to one another. 

Today we had the fitting rooms closed, however, something must have been in the air. Pam started putting the clothes on. Okay, fair enough, it's over her own clothes, I'll leave her be. I carried on tidying, looked up to check on the robbers and Pam was now in her bra, slipping a dress over her head. A couple of times now we have had customers sneak into our fitting rooms, but our in the open like this?

Even pre-Covid, when was it ever okay to just get half in the nud in the middle of a shop?? I went immediately over to my manager and told her what happened, she brushed it off, saying something along the lines of ""well if she wants to be half-naked in the middle of the shop, let her."" There wasn't exactly a lot more we could do about it after that realistically. 

One of the girls on the till, let's call her Vicky, came over to see the faces of the people who were known for robbing, just so that she could make sure to double check their items if she was to serve them. I told her about the woman getting undressed, and as soon as she started walking back to the till, ANOTHER woman took her top off in the middle of the shop so I shouted her back over to see. The robbers were now both trying clothes on too, and Pam started to put some other clothes on. I didn't know what to do, the state all of these women were leaving the shop in was horrendous and I just wanted them gone.

Another girl I work with, let's call her Stella, came over to tell me that the manager now wanted the women told not to play dress up in the middle of the shop, I think the manager realised how out of hand it was beginning to get. We were umming and ahing until Pam took her top off again and I'd had enough. I went over and said pretty much exactly ""I'm sorry that our fitting rooms are closed, but you shouldn't be trying clothes on in the middle of the shop floor, not only because of the pandemic but it's also extremely inappropriate to be in your underwear in the middle of the shop floor.""

I obviously didn't say it kindly, but I wasn't angry. I told her, and the two robbers who were also trying clothes on, sternly. I know I couldn't have even raised my voice because the robbers were asking me what I said as they couldn't even hear me. Pam, though, said I was shouting at her and intentionally embarrassing her in front of the whole shop and I was angry and horrible, she wouldn't stop. Stella was telling her that I wasn't shouting but she wouldn't listen. Stella was actually very calmly saying ""I understand how you feel and I understand what you're saying, but I was right here and OP wasn't shouting at you,"" but Pam wouldn't listen. I said ""can I talk?"" and Pam replied ""WELL I HAVEN'T FINISHED TALKING YET"" and proceeded to repeat everything she had just said. Stella pulled me away and we left them to it.

When they'd all finally left the mirror, I started cleaning the state that they'd left the shop in, it was awful. I hated touching the clothes that they'd worn. I wish I'd have got the disinfectant from the fitting room but I wasn't thinking straight, I just wanted it tidy. Vicky came over again and told me that Pam was just screaming at Stella, telling her that she shouldn't have sided with me. She said that the two women behind her had to ask her what was the matter and said that we were being horrible to her. Stella simply informed Pam that those two women were thieves, so it shows how strong their judge of character must be.

This is the first serious altercation I've had with a customer after having worked in this store for nearly a year (not excluding lockdowns to be fair). I'm not a confrontational person and I tend to give my customers the benefit of the doubt. But to expose yourself in the middle of a shop? That's seriously inappropriate.

One day, while I was working at the cash register, a lady came in trying to buy alcohol.  I couldn't tell how old she was, so I said, ""I would need to see your ID for this.""

""Are you kidding me?"" she huffed as she left the store.  She also added she will be back with an ID.

She was gone for quite a while so I thought she had abandoned the purchase.  I took the beer and was about to put away the product when she returned. She slid her ID towards me, saying, ""Here.""

I checked the ID and found out she was only 7 years younger than me!  I am around 30.    I put through the purchase and she left.

The next day I saw her in the line as I was about to clock in.  I am half wondering if she was trying to avoid my shift.  Ha ha.

1328,"Man cannot understand how €1.99 plus €1 equals €2.99, claims our POS is programmed to add things wrong and charge more","Had an opening shift yesterday. This man comes in, the supervisor later claimed he spent 40 minutes in the dried fruit section trying to steal. 

So he comes up to my till, with a €1.99 pack of chocolates in hand and a €1.05 packet of dried raspberries in the other. I tell him the total, and he absolutely cannot understand how it came up to €3.04. He tells me that it should be €2.04. I keep repeating to him that €1.99 plus €1 makes €2.99, not €1.99, but he starts yelling about how I don’t know how to count and I’m trying to trick him. 

So I get out my calculator, as he refuses to come check out the POS screen with only those two items and the total on it. I work it out for him on the calculator. The total shows €3.04. This does not convince him and he literally says “your machine is wrong”. I am exasperated at this point and my customer service facade has totally worn off, I’m asking him what 1+1 is and he just shouts “okay you’re right because you don’t know how to count”. The supervisor and my manager step in at this point and I don’t know what they told him as my view was blocked by other customers but he left. (I had rang up his things already). 

He came back a few minutes later, much calmer, and told the supervisor I hadn’t given him change, which is not true because the manager confirmed he had seen me count it out and give it to him. The supervisor just gave him the change because at that point we all wanted him to leave and hopefully he never comes back.

1332,You don't want to work with me so I'll make a scene in front of my son," Am 20/F.

This happened about a month ago, during my last week working retail at a wireless electronics store. We basically sold phones and activated service for people.

Around this time, we had been unbelievably slow. Like, for the past four weeks at that store we'd only see maybe 1 person a day, if at all. Incredibly boring, and I was getting paid to basically stand around on my phone all day because without customers there was nothing to really do at our location. There'd be a lot of times where I'd completely zone out, and forget I was at work, and I'd feel like a zombie when customers would come in. Like I was on auto-pilot, if that makes any sense. Was hard to snap out of.

Well, one day, I was in this mode. I was working with a coworker who did not like me, and would go out of his way to avoid interacting with me. So I was inside, behind the counter by myself, playing on my phone, while said coworker was outside talking on the phone to his wife/mom/dad/friends/whoever, out of sight. However, at this time, I thought he was in the employee back area.

A lady walked in at this time, very energetic and bubbly, with her teenaged son... and a dog carrier with a puppy inside. She seemed nice, but something felt off about her and I had a bad feeling. She explained that she had an appointment with us, and I was unaware that we'd had any so my response was, ""Oh, I didn't realize we had any today!""

Which it doesn't really matter if there'd been any kind of appointment, she was there so she was going to be helped regardless. My statement seemed to throw her off, but I explained it wasn't a problem. I grabbed a nearby tablet to start opening up her account, and she started explaining to me that she was just going to leave the dog off to the side of her, as it'd just been at the vet for a surgery. I wasn't sure we were allowed to let people bring animals, but the dog wasn't hurting anyone so I didn't care.

It's important to note, that our tablets work terribly. It is one of the main reasons I quit, because they decided to get rid of our computer systems and make our entire work-process on the tablet. They are slow and glitchy, and the turn-over rate in our district went from being balanced to insanely high because of this decision. They failed to troubleshoot the system all the way before releasing it as well so there were a lot of problems.

For some reason, my tablet wouldn't open, so I'm standing there trying to figure out why it wouldn't bring the lock screen up. The lady looks at me and goes, ""Well, are you ready for our number yet? It's-""

Me - ""Sorry, one second please Ma'am.""

I put that tablet down, and grab the other tablet we had out that was ready, frustrated that the other one wasn't working suddenly. I start to open our system up, when she interrupts me.

Her: ""Wait, this is the store on (street name) right?""

Me: (trying to make small talk)""Yes ma'am. There's another one across the street as well though. Why?""

Her: ""Do you think you could call them and see if they had any appointments for (Her name)?""

Me: ""Sure, give me a second to look up their phone number.""

The store across the street from us, their number was harder to find because you had to use different keywords. It was a stupid layout, because people would confuse them all the time. If you just typed in ""(store name) (city name)"" it would bring up our store number.

After a few minutes, I find their number, and start dialing it on our store phone. As soon as the phone starts ringing, the lady interrupts me again.

Her: ""Actually, since it seems like you don't want to work with anyone, I think I will go across the street.""

This is kind of when I broke character, because at this point I was already over the job itself and was very frustrated. Not even with her, but her attitude and tone at the time absolutely infuriated me. I'm not saying I was in the right either, but the way it seemed to come out of nowhere also threw for a loop. Like, was I not just assisting you? Was I not about to call for you, or blatantly refusing service? Wtf? I tried to be polite, and not catch an attitude, but it was hard to hide the frustration in my voice.

Me: (Where'd that come from???) ""Ma'am, I really don't care, it's entirely your decision if you'd like to go across the street.""

Her: (in complete shock) ""What'd you just say?""

Me: ""That I don't care, it is your decision whether you would like to leave or not. I'm glad to help you either way.""

Her: ""Well, I think I will leave. I'll have you know I'll also be reporting you."" (finger wag)

Me: ""Go ahead, it's my last week anyway.""

Her: ""is anyone else here? I'd like to speak to someone.""

Me: ""Um, yeah, let me go get them from the back.""

So I go into the back to get my coworker, but he isn't anywhere to be found. I hear her trying to open the door(thank god for locks). Next thing I know, the customer is banging on the door with her fist. Like, violently. Totally freaked me out, and I was lost on what to do because I wasn't sure where my coworker was. So I just sat down, and watched the cameras. Maybe I was an asshole, but going back to talk to her didn't seem like a good idea. This was all in front of her son as well, so that must've been embarrassing.

My coworker finally walked back inside, because it was the end of his shift, and he was about to clock out. I have no idea what was said between the two of them, but he was able to calm her down a little bit. Though she still seemed pretty pissed, because I could see her wagging her finger in his face, talking to him. He was super agitated as she was leaving, so it must have not been fun for him to deal with. He let me know that she did, in fact, have an appointment and then left.",0,1623975682
1334,oh look it is two today,"hey all got 2 smaller stories that happened today, the 1st one i heard offhand from my manager at work today and the 2nd is well you will see   


 

the first thing was that a bartender that works for the bar behind my store came out and yelled at a truck delivery driver for ""making my customers walk around the front of your truck"", which is illegal (atleast so i am told) cause it was impeding the driver's delivery since she was telling him to move the truck or turn it around. All of this infront of my manager who was supervising the delivery.    


 the 2nd was a pair of overset women came into the store, 1 looked in her 40s while the others was around 60 or so. So the women come up to me asking about the chlorine tablets we have and I show them. the younger one pulls out her phone and asks me ""so why can I not buy this online with my app"". I explained to her several times, very nicely might I add, that we do not sell the tablets online cause of the shortage in stores. this lady basically complains about this for half an hour until my manager got off her break and came back into the store and decided to take over, and the lady spent another half hour complaining about the same thing and my manager told her the same thing i did. When the two ladies did leave the younger one said ""i am never coming here again, that lady was an ass"" which my manager is the nicest person you would meet in retail.",0,1623971551

1339,Confused patron,"I was reading through some posts and it reminded me of a situation that occurred back in 2007

It was getting late and we close at 12am. I no longer work at this chain. An older gentlemen was loading up a wagon for about an hour and a half. 

I was the sole register open. 4 employees total in the store our manager and assistant manager and a Cart pusher doing stocking duty for the evening.

It was just before closing my manager noticed the man still did not seem ready but we closed the store anyway with him still shopping and the 4 of us focused on assisting him.

He was kind soft spoken yet very confused.

When he finally made it to the register we rang him up and he promptly paid. I can't remember if my Manager considered contacting the authorities but sometging did not seem right about the man.

After we finished our closing and locked the store we came outside to see him still standing there with his cart.

My manager spoke to him again he seemed disoriented but I couldn't gather what the exact conversation they were having was.

We ended up verifying his address on his driver's liscense and I drove him there he had walked to the store he did not have any transportation. There were no cars other than ours in the parking lot either.

I drove him home I remember distinctly he asked me to leave his groceries near his door but did not want help taking them in.

None of this was very inconvenient I lived 5 minutes away he lived the same distance from the store. 

But I never saw him again and always felt uncomfortable about the situation.",0,1623896209

She thanked me and walked out. I am still confused and walked back and told my manager about this, we had a nice laugh about it.

1341,I’ll go into labour after I check out these sales,"In college I worked at a large chain store that happened to be going out of business so there were massive closing sales. During the evening while I was sorting some clothes in the Women’s Department, a very pregnant woman and her mother walked past me and all I hear is “oh my gosh, I think my water just broke!” Naturally, I whipped my head around to face the women since that’s not a line you hear everyday and sure enough, the woman’s pants were wet and a pool of clear/yellow liquid had formed at her feet.

My first response was “oh wow” because my mouth reacted before my brain and just the amazement at the whole situation. I asked if they needed an ambulance to be transported to the hospital or if they wanted to take their own vehicle or call someone. And to my shock - the mother said that they were going to shop around in the store a bit longer because “these sales are too good to pass up” and the daughter whose water just broke and is leaking onto the floor, agreed!!! So they kept shopping and looking around  and tracking amniotic fluid everywhere they went and finally made their way to the cash to check out.

Meanwhile, my coworkers and I are scrambling to find the Wet Floor sign but it is MIA so I had to stand near the area where the woman’s water initially broke and direct customers to walk around it the fluid.

So they check out and leave to go to the hospital and at this point the woman was definitely going into labour and was waddling (more than a pregnant woman usually would) to get out of the store. As soon as they left, we broke out the cleaning supplies and started sanitizing.

I’d like to point out that when my coworker checked them out, she said that they weren’t even buying anything baby related, but all women’s clothing. I’m not judging because she could very well have had all her clothes and everything ready for her baby. But is a store closing sale really that important that you’ll keep shopping even after your water broke?

Never saw them again but hope the baby was born healthy.",0,1623883655

1362,Woman proves herself wrong and storms out of store,"I work in a family owned pet food/supply store. We have this program that often has deals like ""buy one get one free"" for certain products, and when a deal is going on we'll put a little paper sign up by the product. 

A woman comes in and buys three things: a case of the most expensive cat treats we carry (the case was like $40 it's crazy) and two small bags of freeze dried meal mixer things. I ring her up and tell her her total and the woman gives me the ugliest look. 

""One of these is free"" she grabs one of the freeze dried meal mixer bags. 

Me: It didn't ring up as free... (Our system is is weird. Some of the time it's up to date with the program's deals and will automatically ring it up as such. Other times we need to enter the stuff into a completely different system to redeem the deals and rewards. It's a pain.) 

Customer, getting more aggressive and angry: The sign said it was buy one get one free.

I'm about to tell her that she may be right and I will go check the sign when my manager who was behind the counter with me speaks up.

Manager: That's for the kibble. You buy a bag of kibble and get one of the freeze dried bags free. 

Customer, in the nastiest tone i've heard from someone yet: That's not what the sign says. 

My manager gets up and she and the customer go to check the sign. It's quiet for a moment and then the woman comes storming from around the corner.

""***You know what, forget it***"" She's absolutely irate. She storms out the door without any of her stuff. My manager returns to the counter. Just like she said, the deal was 'buy a bag of kibble and get a bag of freeze dried meal mixers free.'

Had his friend shop for about $200 worth of groceries, check out at his lane, and he rang it all up as $0.99 (he rang it all up as one lemon, as it were).

The thing is, the friend he was helping also worked there. Also as a cashier.

The head honcho was in that day. His office oversees the whole store so he saw it immediately. Both idiots got fired right then and there (though the one guy who was buying the groceries took off before being confronted).

1381,Stopped a shoplifter and got written up,"I work at a retail liquor store. Here's the brief backstory....We have had an increase of people coming into the store to exclusively use the bathroom in order to smoke meth, and use other illicit substances. To help prevent this common occurrence, there is now about 15 shopping carts blocking the bathrooms in addition to the ""Out of Order' signage.  There also has been a significant uptick in theft, which we can basically do nothing about due to the 'no chase policy'.  I'm allowed to call the non emergency police line, but the cops rarely catch the perps or show up on time, which is expected. 

Fast-forward to about an hour ago.  Less than reputable person comes into the store, gets a drink from the cold box and proceeded to bee line towards the bathrooms. I'm in pursuit because I've seen this scenario play out numerous times. I proceed to tell the person that the bathrooms are out of order. The individual then drops some garage on the sales floor and proceeds to walk out of the store while holding the beverage that was taken from the cold box seconds beforehand.  I yell at the person that she 'needs to pay' for the item and that the 'drinks aren't free.'. My cashier then yells at her as well, repeating what I had just said.  The perp clearly hears us both but decided the cold shoulder treatment works best and proceeded to walk right out of the store, item firmly in hand. 

I call the non emergency line to the local police to report the theft. Shockingly, the cops responded within about 2-3 minutes to our location.  I gave the responding officer a detailed description of the person of interest and the series of events that took place leading to the blatant theft. The officer then received a radio call and had to immediately leave.  Not five minutes later, the same officer returned to our store to ask if I was familiar with Positive ID procedures, which I am familiar with being prior military. 

I was asked to get into the squad car in order to ID the suspect which was apprehended not three blocks away from the store's location. I gleefully obliged to go for the ride, because I'm frankly sick of dealing with this situation on a near daily occurrence. I was taken to an empty lot where the suspect was detained by a different officer. While sitting in the back of the squad car, I confirmed that indeed the detainee was the person that had just robbed the store. At this time, the officer left the vehicle to assist the arresting officer with the perp. 

I call my boss to inform her of the situation. Not a single attaboy was given, quite the opposite. Now I'm getting a written reprimand for leaving the store (which was closed and locked) because there was only one employee in the building, which is against company policy. Beautiful how things work out in the end. 

Summary- I left the store in a squad car in order to positivity ID a shoplifter only to get reprimanded for leaving the closed store with one employee on duty with a police officer posted at the door.",0,1623646528
1382,Marriage on sale for $69.99,"To this day I'm still at a loss on how to process this specific interaction I had as a manager working for this particularly popular fabric store in my town. 

A woman had come in during one of my weekend shifts and I was asked by one of my coworkers to help her because she was being difficult. I happily complied believing that the woman in question simply did not know what she wanted, (we get a lot of customers that don't know what they want for their projects) which is no big deal. I greet her and she tells me she's looking for cushions for pillows. She first tells me I'm handsome (I'm a guy) then I start showing her the cushions we had in stock.

Immediately she starts telling me that these will not do, that they are not right for the sofas she is trying to make before her sisters fly in. She further proclaims that I am incompetent and don't know what I am doing as well as threatening to report me to my reporting manager above me. This continued for what seemed an eternity and I gritted my teeth because I'm too nice and patient. 

When she finally decided on something that she was okay with, the interaction shifted to me as a person. She asks if I'm single. Uncomfortable with this complete 180 of a conversation I reluctantly reply ""no."" She then describes how she as a woman does intimacy acts the best and that as a man I need to experience it. Furthermore she asks if I've been in an ARRANGED MARRIAGE.

Weirded out completely, I again reply ""no."" ""Marry me then."" She replied. Quickly and awkwardly I said ""no thank you."" She did not like this answer at all. She went on a rant with threats about how the employees need to help the customer and that basically the customer is important. The verbal abuse continued to drain me along with the sheer disbelief. She ended her rant with yet again a threat to tell the general manager about how I was terrible and not only unwilling to help a customer but also terrible at my job entirely.

She gave me her cushions and told me to put them on hold for her until she came back, then left. I Quickly complied and walked away to make the hold. 

So I guess the moral of the story is, you're a terrible worker if you can't marry the customer. Lol",0,1623640264

1390,We can only ting up people so fast,"I work for a convenience store and pharmacy In the States. I just had my 1st story worthy experience in retail.  It is a busy Saturday night and busier than most with only 3 people on shift, Myself the cashier, my manager, and the pharmacist.   Because of this my manager has been rushing Is back-and-forth between the pharmacy and up front helping out however she can. Around 11 o'clock we get an alert on our communications system is communications system that a same day order pick up has been registered and assigned to our store, Which means Manager has toIs now split her attention 3 ways to pick up Is everything in that order.
 Right as the order finished being put together, we get the alert that the customer Is in the parking lot and Ready for our current sized service which we had shut down at 9 o'clock for safety reasons due to the neighbourhood our store is in. 
Manager tells a customer To queue up in the pharmacy drive-thru and we would be happy to deliver it to her that way.  There is at this point one other person in the drive-through.
 up front I have not been able to get the line below 5 people in line all by myself But I am processing customers at a pretty decent clip.
 I am made aware of the situation when As I'm in the middle of processing a customer, with a line 7 customers deep by gettting a call on the store phone which I answer with my polite greeting.

 ""Thank you for calling [store name] on [cross streets]  how many I help you.""

""HI I am in line here and am waiting for service on my pickup order.""

Making eye contact with the lady standing out of line at the photo counter about 30 feet away. "" I will be happy to help you with that is just a moment miss."" Then I go back to checking out the customer I am on. It is then that my manager chimes in to catch me up. That the  order in ready back in the  Pharmacy. She has pissed me off and so I am in no fucking hurry to convenience her By letting her cut in front of the still 5 or 6 People who have been patiently waiting in line.

Taking my sweet time without sounding rude to the other customers who hadYou've been waiting patiently, I clear the line and she steps up to the counter. Before she can say anything I say "" and what is the order name under?""  And she proceeds to get snippy Is spelling out her name. I look through the order pick ups  Before pretending to get a message on my earpiece. I then explain that the order is fill and. Waiting for her at the pharmacy as it was marked in our system as a drive-thru pick up. 

""You expect me to walk all the way back there?""

Looking at the 4 people that had queued up behind her amd the 2 more walking towards the end of the queue.

""Unfortunately yes as that is where it is right now. But I would be more then happy to ring you up for anything else you have while you are here.""

She turns and walks away without a word.

Tldr  Older Karen Was so impatient that she couldn't wait 3 to 5 minutes in her car. 
Ended up spending 15 minutes standing in line Only to Wait those 3 or 5 minutes more in the store before getting her items.",0,1623579296
1391,Short Tempered Customers Steal Two Loaves of Bread and Berate My Customer Service While Doing So.,"I’ve worked at my grocery store for almost 2 years at this point and found nothing that felt crazy enough or important enough to share here, until tonight.

Today was a mostly average day at work, wake up tired and have a slow first couple hours on till, then get energized after a nice caffeinated beverage on my first break. The rest of my shift goes very smoothly with lots of compliments from my customers. Many of them were very happy to see me back on till as for the past few weeks I needed to do other jobs to let my hands recover. All in all a pretty typical and enjoyable day… Until the last hour or so of my shift.

After my last break we really started slowing down and with so many cashiers on till most of our time was spent finding little tasks to occupy our time. I ended up asking my manager if there was anything else I could help with, and she had me put our reduced to clear items in separate boxes to donate to the food bank. I ended up getting that done with half an hour left on my shift. So I was asked to clean my till and got that done when I was called to help a customer in the bakery.

Normally when cashiers are called to help in the bakery it is to write on cakes, get items out of the display case, or take orders for cakes; but today when I got there the customer had a different request. He asked for some of the bread that was left out unpackaged the temporary storage trays (I don’t work in the bakery normally so this might be wrong). Most of our employees would likely say that they don’t know their way around the bakery and thus can’t help, but not I. I told the man I don’t know why it was left there but I can see if I can get them for him if he really wants it. He said he did so I was off.

I quickly went searching for the bread packaging and found a box with the correct label and so I told him I’d quickly wash my hands and grab him one. By the time I got back with the loaf two other customers (a young looking boy and a slightly older looking woman, siblings maybe?) were lined up behind him and asked me for two. I asked them for a moment and sealed the bread for the first customer and went to find the price. I checked all the displays that normally would have the bread on them and I couldn’t quite find the price. I was about to give my manager a quick call to ask her if she knew, when the boy asked me if I could get them their bread first. I was a little caught off guard by this given I needed to find the price to be able to sell the bread and I told them this. In response the woman said they can do it in the front. I know that they can’t so I say that the only way to do that is if they find the price here so I might as well find it first. She then tells me she worked there a few years ago and that she definitely could and she says some bs price at $1.19. I know that definitely isn’t the price so I quickly say it’s closer to $1.69 (in hindsight I think it was $1.89 but it’s not too big of a deal). So I tell the man and wish him well and he is off. Now I tell the other customers that I don’t know why the bread has been left out they ask if it’s stale. This is a bread that has a hard outer layer and when I was holding the other customer’s bread it felt about normal so I told them that. They say that’s fine and that they want it so I get them their bread. I’m about to seal it in the bags when they tell me they don’t need me to do that. Once again I’m surprised but sure if they are happy with their bread unsealed then I will happily leave them to it and they are off.

A couple other customers are asking for a cake order, unfortunately as cashiers we have been asked to not take them unless we have been specifically trained by the bakery. So I tell them that and I will find someone else to take it for them so they can do their order. I quickly run to the front and ask the person taking over the service desk and self check if she has been trained she says she has and hands over the self check key to me. Low and behold the two customers from earlier arrive at the self checkout with their bread and a few other groceries. They need me to give them an override because there is too much weight on the scale. So I do my normal thing and ask them what the last item scanned was, it happened to be correct, I double checked their scanned item and all of them were on the scale. Then once again I’m caught off guard when the woman asks me if I’m new here (as if taking these steps are somehow a sign of inexperience). I reply by telling her I’ve been here for almost 2 years then do the override and tell them they are all good. I then await them calling me over again to help them with their bread as there is no way to enter it on the self check system without employee assistance. I quickly help some other customers with overrides and laugh with them about how finicky our self check is. Then I notice the initial two customers are paying and I am instantly confused and intrigued by how they managed to finish ringing through their items without my assistance.

As the customers walk away from their check out I ask them how they did their bread and they show me their receipt and point at an entry labels sandwich rolls 2 for $1.38. The woman then tells me that the bread was $1.39 per loaf. At this point I’m assuming they are very confused and I inform the that they entered sandwich rolls and not the bread they had. She tells me that the image looked exactly like the bread and so I go over to the self check and ask her to show me what she did. I notice they also left their cake in their basket which is kinda silly but I figure I’ll deal with it later. So I start opening the item menu to have her show me what she did, when the boy is pressing on the bread and all of a sudden decides it is stale. He says it’s rock hard and I apologize because I don’t work in the bakery I don’t know how exactly the bread is supposed to feel. She then says is this what you call customer service? Immediately I feel adrenaline coursing through me as I take great pride in my customer service and work as hard as I can to make sure all of my customers have the best experience possible. So I ask because I’m genuinely confused what did I do wrong? The woman then exclaims “unbelievable”. The boy asks her to leave it. I tell her I’m confused and I don’t understand what happened. She then tells says she doesn’t want to speak to me and she wants to return the bread and buy sourdough instead. I tell her I can help her with that, and she gets more frustrated and tells me she will go to the service desk because she doesn’t want to speak to me. I tell her that at this time I am at the service desk. And she says well I want to speak to anyone other than you. I tell her we don’t have anyone else available at the moment as my manager was on break and everyone else who could be at the service desk was busy. She tells me she’ll have one of the cashiers do it. While the cashiers are on till they aren’t supposed to do returns, it’s only supposed to be managers or the person working at the desk. I tell her this. And she even more angrily tells me that she doesn’t care who does it as long as it isn’t me. So I take a moment, pause, and ask where things went wrong and if there is anything I can do to improve her experience with me. She yet again tells me she doesn’t want to speak to me. I ask again and tell her I’m the only one who can help her and I’d like to do that if she can just tell me what went wrong and how I can serve her better. She absolutely doesn’t care and is practically hiding behind her arms at this point trying to ignore me. Then our service clerk for the day comes by and says he can do the return. I tell him that while he is normally a cashier while he is service clerk he isn’t supposed to do that (he has only been here for a couple months). But he insists, and I am forced to allow him to do it as if I continue to protest that would actually be bad customer service and I cannot allow myself to do that especially when I’m already being accused of poor customer service.

I let him process the refund and ask him what issue she had with me, and she says she thought I was accusing her of stealing. Which I very much wasn’t and I wouldn’t have thought at all normally until she said that that was her issue. He also told me that he recharged them and it ended about being about $2.50 for the bread. And no they didn’t actually change it for sourdough like they said they would. I then glance over at the clock and see that I am a minute past the end of my shift and quickly punch out. Then I double check the till and print the last receipt, and it is not the return receipt it is something entirely different, which means they left without actually paying and they had stolen the two loaves of bread.

I then fill my manager in on the details of what happened and she confirms they were definitely stealing as getting increasingly irate and refusing to explain themselves is a very telltale sign of attempted theft. The idea is they will scare you off so you might end up letting them go. She was also very shocked to hear that they insulted my customer service as I am one of the best at that in the store.

And yes, I know this whole story is basically about $2 worth of bread being stolen and it’s pretty pointless to actually get worked up over something so small. But on principle I can’t let people leave without paying as that would be theft even if unintentional. And then I very much couldn’t let the situation simply stay after they attack my customer service. Once that happens I go into my serious mode where I take the interaction ridiculously seriously as I need to show them that their initial impression was wrong and I am in fact able to provide top quality customer service which is why I couldn’t simply let them go.

Anyway sorry about this massive story and thank you for reading to the end. If you have any questions or would like me to clarify anything I’ll happily do so for you if you ask in the comments. Thanks again!",0,1623559242

Where I use to work, probably similar to a lot of retail locations, we’d have one item on the front page of our sales flyer which would be discounted heavily. Like 75 percent off or so. And it would a type of item where they would put in “While supplies last.” 

There was one item we had on the front page, and I was curious to see how much money our store were making per item, and since I have access to look up that info, I decided to take a look. 

We were making 3 cents per item. 

I had a women come in, and she was buying a whole bunch. I can’t remember how much, but she took a huge chunk of our inventory. She then proceeded to ask me “Since I’m buying a whole bunch, can I get them cheaper?”

I looked at her and replied “No. Sorry. We are only making 3 cents for every one sold.” 

She gives a defeated “Oh.” I can’t remember what she did next, but I think she put them back where she got them.

1402,I’ll just buy a new one,"Worked in a camera store sooooooo many life times ago when digital cameras had only just started coming out.

To go along with the then new tech, we started doing in store printing from digital media but only certain media like CDs or USB or Floppy. I had this one customer come in with one of the latest Kodak Digital cameras wanting to print the images from it. He took the memory card out, a very flimsy smart card, and told me to print from it.

Now we couldn’t print from a smart card, so I told him I’d need to transfer it to a CD before printing, which would cost nothing. Either he didn’t understand what I what telling him or he didn’t hear me so I repeated it. He then went in to a full meltdown about how he spent so much on a camera that he can’t print from, that it was a hunk of crap etc etc. Even my manager was telling him that we CAN print but he needed to give us a moment to get the set up to do it. Nope! Customer wasn’t having it and continued his rant only to throw that camera in our bin and shout that he will go an buy a better one……..

My manager and I along with a customer or two that were there, just looked at each other bewildered. We retrieved the camera from our bin, downloaded the images and found a picture of the mans driving licence. We then packaged up the camera and posted it out to him with a CD copy, with a PDP pay-postage-on-receipt label (like hell were we paying out to send him is property which was also damaged after the bin toss). Back then the courier charged a flat rate for delivery with 10% surcharge if paying on receipt. Not too sure if they do that now, but we never saw that customer again.",0,1623507555

1407,“Your last check will be mailed to you.”,"Apologies for lengthy post, TL;DR at the bottom



Apologies if this isn’t the proper place for this story, I’ve just really wanted to rant about it for a long time. I worked for a major retailer for about two and a half years, from August of 2017 to December of 2019. I realize that’s not nearly as long as some people stay at jobs but it’s long enough that I was pretty familiar with the management staff, including the store manager. I’d seen many people get hired and many people get fired or quit. I’d worked over my schedule, worked off days, and been generally reliable. Near the end of 2019, my partner at the time was hospitalized for some health complications, I missed a day of work to stay at the hospital with them. I called and spoke to the manager on duty for that day who instructed me to use their automated call out line. I  did forget to do this but I returned the next day and apologized and asked if there was any way to overlook it due to the circumstances. They gave a vague answer which I took to mean they’d handle it for me. Perhaps this was arrogant of me to think, but I expected that my performance and reliability would have granted me some leniency. Regardless of whether I was right or wrong to believe that, I was fired. I tried to clock in the next day, only to find my badge and employee number wouldn’t work. I spoke to the store manager and one of the assistant store managers who explained that because I hadn’t used the automated line for calling out, my absence had been entered as a “no call, no show”. I didn’t beg for my job or bother wasting my time discussing options for returning. I was too angry and my partner was still in the hospital. I did however ask about my final paycheck, as I would need it to pay my rent. The store manager says “your last check will be mailed to you.” I leave, and begin looking for other jobs. Being unemployed for any amount of time would make paying my share of rent for my apartment difficult. I wasn’t able to immediately find anything that was full time with a rate that would keep me in my apartment. But all was not lost. I had some money saved up. And I did have at least one more check coming in the mail within the next week or two. I did find a part time job that I started while I kept looking for something full time. After three weeks I called the store I’d been fired from and spoke to a different manager who assured me all final checks are sent in the mail after termination. By this time, the complex had already given notice to my roommates about our rent being a little late. I assumed my check was just lost in the mail but still on its way. I kept looking for better work and kept working the PT job I had.  Eventually the complex informs me that we have now incurred a late fee, in addition to the rent we already owe. As everything begins to close in on me, I get a message from a former coworker who still worked at the store. Something close to “hey, do you know you have a check here? HR’s been holding it” I respond simply, “no I didn’t know that. Thanks.” I immediately go to pick up this check, furious at being lied to and having my money simply held. I ended up speaking to the assistant store manager who had been in the room during the discussion where I was told how I would receive the check. I told him “that’s my money, and you’ve been holding it here after I was told it would be mailed. That belongs to me and you’re going to give it to me.” Maybe that sounded a bit extreme but I didn’t (and still don’t) care.  He said something back that I don’t remember. I knew he didn’t like what I said but he didn’t have a choice. So he gave me the check and I left, fuming. It was not enough to pay the rent and late fee and we were eventually evicted. But if I had received it sooner, it would have covered my share of rent for the month, with some left over to help with the next. I know it was a simple mistake that led to me getting fired, I do accept that responsibility. My frustration comes from the fact that I was told twice my check would be in the mail, while it was sitting in a cabinet in a desk for weeks.

TL;DR- worked at a store for 2.5 years, did overtime, worked off days, worked nights for months on a remodel, fired for missing a day when partner was hospitalized, did not receive my last check in the mail in time for rent, was evicted afterwards",0,1623479111

Our ties have no deal with them and are $15-$20 each. A man comes in, grabs 3 ties and asks “is there a deal for three ties considering I am getting multiple?”

“Unfortunately not” I said

Apparently this guy didn’t like my answer and expected to bend to his will because he replies with “are you able to give me a discount since I am wanting to buy 3? If not I will not shop here for anything else”

“Yeah I can’t do anything in regards to giving a discount on products unless there is a pre-existing deal with it” I said. The next thing he said made me want to actually laugh though.

“Are you sure? Because I really need these ties”.

She had a small chevy s10 pick up that would hold maybe 3 4 yards at most but she wanted it all NOW! and she wanted the red brick dyed mulch that was 10 bucks a yard.

Her eyes were bugging out and she was speechless. The manager already tired of dealing with people all day on a Saturday said might wanna open the glove box and walked away. She said i will come back.

1412,"I'm NEVER coming back!!! Great, see you next week.","For a while I owned and ran a garden supply store. I had a lady come in and she wanted X amount of soil. Well X amount turned into 7.5 pallets of soil. I didn't have this all in stock so I called my supplier and asked to see if they could deliver and drop this at her location. Since it wasn't terribly far away they agreed.

Lady: I asked for 2 bags of soil yesterday and you charged me 9 thousand dollars!

me: Ma'am, you asked for X amount, NOT 2 bags. You even asked how much soil was in the bags and that was how we determined your quantity.

L: I did NO such thing, I asked for TWO BAGS OF SOIL!!!

me: Ma'am, I do video and audio recordings in here (I had multiple signs posted) should we go check the tapes?

L: There's no need, you just need to take the soil back!

me: Ma'am, I can't do that. All soil sales are final and this was a large quantity order. Also, I don't know what happened to it last night so I don't feel comfortable sending it back to the supplier.

L: (after more yelling) I'm never coming back, I'm leaving bad reviews, and I'm telling everyone to not shop here!

I advised this can happen in the mornings but it should have been put back onto her card if not. The customer said the worker straight up (a keyholder mind you) told her that since it was done as debit, she is only allowed to give cash back and since she doesn't have enough money, the customer will have to return later. 

So I called the worker like WTF. She said, ""I was trained to only put it back on a card if it was credit and only give cash back for debit."" I was like so you refused to put it back on her card because its debit? She said yes. 

I straight up had to explain to someone who has been working for us since 2018 that a debit card refund can be put back on the customers debit card and we shouldn't be denying returns when they have everything they are supposed to.

1418,Smoke screening does not check out.,"I am a 330 lbs Samoan wrestler and Martial artist who works for a large retail chain I often do a lot of walking in the store and I find if there is a incident all I have to do is be present to de escalate it.

On this particular day i just so happened to be walking by a particular dept I love to greet my co workers so I did to the employee at this station and moved on.

Not 10 seconds later I hear indecipherable but angry screams and I turn to see it directed at the employee I had just greeted.

An older patron was accosting him but with just echoing screams he was not saying any words. I moved in between them and my manager showed up as well.

By this time the patron has calmed down but he seemed embarrassed and was trying to bolt. My Co worker acknowledged that his transaction was complete but couldnt identify why the patron was so angry.

Finally the Store manager took the patron aside and got the whole story from him.

I walked away by then but when I saw my co worker again he had been ""coached"" so the old patron was buying smokes with a check and my co worker asked him for an ID to verify the name on the check not to verify the age of the patron. 

My co worker was told that he should not have asked for the ID.",0,1623361581
1419,Guy Upset Over Checks,"So i've talked about the hellscape that is the store I work at for my evenings/weekend job. The thing about this place is we've strict (Or supposed to be strict, but the boss' friends are immune to the rules cause friendship) rules regarding checks. Rules that vary depending on if it's a paycheck or a checkbook check. Our store identifies paychecks as those obnoxiously large checks that come with a paystub that you get from your employer, where everythng is printed on the check and not written in via pen. It's payroll checks.

We only do cash back for 40 dollars, so if you're not buying anything you can only write a check for 40. If you buy something, it's 40 over your total, so still 40. For paychecks we only do 250$ and there is a charge you have to pay if you're check is larger than $50. A lot of people get upset over this, because the boss let's some people write checks for 200 and not buy anything because she's buddies with them. Others get upset because they are regulars and the rules shouldn't apply to them. 

Now this one guy, he's an adult, probably in the 30-40 range if I'm to guess, he comes in every few weeks with checks, checkbook checks written out to him that he wants to cash, says they're his paychecks and maybe they are, it's not my job to investigate where the checks came from and why they were given to him. The thing is, by the store rules, they don't qualify as paychecks because they are torn from a checkbook and are written out in pen as opposed to being a payroll check. Usually these checks have ranged from 80 to 200, so they are well over the limit we're allowed to cash for those kinds of checks. He always gets upset and argues that we let him do it last time, I always return that I am not responsible for them breaking the rules, that I've told him prior that we don't cash checkbook checks that large out.

Monday was kind of a rough day between numerous disasters at my day job and at this one I was stuck with a newbie who didnt want to work and a closer who was 4 hours late. The guy comes in with two checks that would have totaled out as over 300. I explained that we can't cash them out, do the same song and dance with him complaining that we always let him cash it and me reiterating the rules we have regarding checks. He lashed out and yelled *""Where am I supposed to cash these f\*\*\*\*\* checks if you won't let me do it here?*"" like he was loud enough that I had people in the back turning to look.  I admit, with how stressful that day had been I snapped back, and told him that maybe it's time he start taking them to an actual bank. 

He tooks his checks and stormed off. I honestly doubt he's bothered to go to a bank, probably went to some other gas station and complained until they cashed it for him. I'll probably see him again in a couple of weeks, and we'll do it all over again. this is such a common thing tho, people trying to cash their checks here and being upset that we wont, is there like a reason people refuse to cash their checks at banks?",0,1623350364
1420,Colleague got egged over insurance coverage for customer's medication,"This is my first time posting here and this happened years ago at my first Jon.  Typing on mobile so please excuse any typos.

My first job as a teenager was at a large chain pharmacy that also sold food and home goods.  The store was near several old folks homes, so we had mostly elderly customers.  

One day I was asked to work the register in the pharmacy with the pharmacy tech to assist with long lines.  I had caught up with customers and was just standing around while the tech rung up an older lady.  She had picked up a few groceries from the store area and wanted to check out at the pharmacy register with her prescription pick up.  No problem.  The tech pulled up her file on the computer and saw a note saying the prescription wasn't covered by her insurance.

She became absolutely livid!  How dare we withhold her medicine!  She began shouting and wanted us to give her the price with insurance coverage.  We simply can't do that as we have no control over what insurance decides to cover.  This elderly woman then proceeded to pick up her carton of eggs and throw them at the pharmacy tech!  He dodged the eggs and they exploded all over the floor behind the desk.  She then pulled her purse up over her shoulder, turned around, and stomped out of the store. 

The whole time I just stood there in shock, watching it all go down.  I had never seen someone act that way!  The tech calmly brushed it off as if it was a normal occurrence.  I grabbed the mop bucket and we cleaned up the mess together.  

This whole situation has stuck with me all these years and I thought it would fit well on this sub.  Thanks for reading!  And remember that staff has no control over insurance so please be nice!",0,1623347766

One night I was running my money service associate's lunch and this lady comes up and wants to cash a check. That being said our policy clearly states that it may not be altered in any way nor can it be a personal check (must be a non-negotiable, payroll, or government check). There are many implementations in which were put in with our check cashing system at the time. So I ask for her ID and the check she wishes to cash. She proceeds to hand me what appears to have been a money order.  When I looked at said check, it had been altered with white out on it. When I told her our policy wouldn't allow me to cash this check due to it be considered altered. She proceeded to throw a bunch of signage at the customer behind her and at me.

1427,Hulk Smash Over Self-Checkout,"So here's a goody from when I worked at an orange home improvement store. Didn't happen to me but my coworker. 

So this was during COVID's peak in my state and line were bonkers at our store like wrapped around the inside of the store to the back wall. As you may imagine we got many crazies to come in over this time and also just impatient and frustrated people, which is understandable. Here's where it gets good. So there is a line at self-checkout and this guy who'll call HS for Hulk smash is already huffing and puffing and causing a scene in line about having to use self-checkout and having to wait in line. Now HS gets to the self-checkout and proceeds to reluctantly scan his items. As HS gets ready to pay the card reader is declining his card due to a chip error, still don't know if it was the card or the reader as our new readers we got at the time did this a lot. So what is the natural reaction for HS to this situation? Ask for help? Retry the card again? no my man's HS straight-up sucker punch the screen breaking the screen and damaging the LEDs in the screen rendering the whole system useless as our registers were all in one computer. So low and behold my coworker calls over our store manager to notify her that this man has just damaged about $700 worth of stuff and caused a scene while doing it. The store manager shows up to speak with him, and again what do you think she did? Call the police? Have Asset protection put HS on a trespass notice and force him to pay for damages? No, she gave him all his stuff for free and made no effort to punish HS for breaking our stuff which made our jobs more difficult as we had to wait well over a week for a new computer and this was one of the only 2 self-checkout machines that took cash so it slowed our line even more.

1432,"Lady insists we buy a cell phone so that I don't waste HER time, when she calls the store 5x per hour.","This is my first time posting here, but this lady really knocked my socks off. 

&amp;#x200B;

I work for a small co-op grocery store in a college town. We have a pretty good mix of college students who just come to get smoothies and sandwiches from our deli, along with locals who do their weekly grocery shopping with us. 99 percent of them are wonderful people, and I know most of the regulars by name and catch up when I see them. 

&amp;#x200B;

However, there is one customer that is so universally despised by the entire staff that I'm the only one willing to serve her. ('Willing' meaning that I'm the lowest on the totem pole being the newest cashier, and I get asked to do it by senior staff.) This woman will call the store FIVE TIMES OR MORE in a row, and insist with each call that I find a specific product, read to her the list of ingredients on the product, tell her the exact price, number of varieties, and every other little detail you could imagine. She doesn't ask for it all at one time, though. She insists that I run back and forth all over the store, instead of just asking me everything she wants to know in one go. And to top it off, THEN she will send her husband to buy the actual product, call OUR PHONE, and demand that he be put on the line. And I have to balance this with the customers I already have in the store. 

&amp;#x200B;

Yesterday I saw her name come up on our caller ID.  I cursed both the day I was born and that phones were invented when I picked up. This time, she asked if we sold a soft white bread. I told her that our fresh bread supplier didn't usually send us that type- and she demanded I tell her if we could special order ONE loaf just for her. I told her I didn't know if this company (an artisan bread type deal) even made white bread, but if she would look into their offerings, that we might be able to make that happen for her. She then asked me to check the freezer, where we keep our other breads for sale.  I came back to the phone, and read off the brands we offer that I felt fit the bill. 

&amp;#x200B;

Then, of course, I get two customers up to the register.  I'm the only cashier, so I did what my manager advised me to tell her in this exact situation. Tell her: 'I have another customer to serve right now, I have to call you back.' 

&amp;#x200B;

But, before I could even get this little nugget of info out of my mouth, she says this: 'you know, I really think you guys should invest in a cell phone so I don't have to spend as much time on hold.'

&amp;#x200B;

I kind of laughed, all the while silently apologizing to my customer who was patiently waiting with his groceries. I laughed because I legitimately thought that she was joking. 

&amp;#x200B;

Y'all, she was not joking. 

&amp;#x200B;

Her: ""You know, it would save ME so much time if you guys were to invest in a cell phone, that way I could just call you whenever I needed you. That way I could just let you run all over the store and you could let me know what you have."" 

&amp;#x200B;

Me: \*flabbergasted\* ""Ma'am, uh, that's a suggestion for management. I don't have any control over the phone situation.""

&amp;#x200B;

Her: ""well let me speak with a manager then, is one in?"" 

&amp;#x200B;

Me, now completely floored: ""Nope, manager just left!"" I told her the truth, and apologized profusely in charades to the guy that I had started to ring out, all while she kept me on the line. This answer must have pissed her off however, because we ended the call seconds later.  She didn't call me back again 5 minutes later, or send her husband in. 

&amp;#x200B;

1433,Just because I work here doesn't mean I'm your friend,"There's this guy that comes in every day.  He's annoying.  He comes in right when we open, will actually sit in the parking lot waiting for us to open. 
Then he walks through the store greeting everyone by name. He only knows our name because of name tags and he's part of the reason I don't wear one (I don't want customers coming up to me outside of work).  Then he expects people to to stop and have a social conversation with him. Even if we have a hundred things to do. He's actually gotten a attitude with people when they're busy. 

He thinks he gets to make demands because he's there every day ""you should turn those lights on"", those lights aren't supposed to go on til 7am when the department opens, he was there a little after 6 and I was only helping him to be nice. 

There have been occasions when he's gotten things from us in deli, then just stuck it somewhere and we found it later.  Like whyyyy why waste our time.  He does it to other people too, will ask where something is and when they take him too he'll stand there and talk about what he needs it for.

Then if he catches you on your 15 minute break he thinks that you'll waste it standing talking to him. It's only 15 minutes and I have stuff to do. 

Maybe I'm mean but I'm there to get a paycheck, I'm nice because I have to be but if I see people like him outside of work I'd act the same as if they were a stranger. 

People have told me that maybe I shouldn't be in a customer service job but it's not in my job description to be friends with customers.  I just have to be friendly. 

There's other regular customers that I like and will have a little chat with if I have time, but they're not irritating either and know that we're there to work. So it's not just  me being a jerk to any customer.",0,1623244457

I got into my car, which was parked less than 30 feet from a main rod going through the town. As I start my vehicle, I suddenly hear a voice calling out. I look to my left and see a guy approaching my car. 

He asks me if I work there, and I replied I do. He then asks if the store is closed, and I say “Yes. The store closed a few minutes ago.” 

He then proceeds to ask if we sell suction cups. I told him I don’t work in the store, so I know nothing of what is sold inside. He then asked if I could go and check with the staff, to see if they do. I told him the store is closed, they are locking everything up. 

He then asks “Can you ask them tomorrow if they do for me?” I didn’t even know the guy, and I wasn’t gonna do something he could easily do himself. 

I told him “You’re gonna have to do it yourself. You’ll either have to come in or phone tomorrow.” He grumbled something, then walked off past my car towards the door of the store. 

I watched him for a minute, and despite the fact I told him him the store was closed, he opened the door and walked inside.

1435,Customer yelling at employees,"For a bit of context, I work at a retail store, in the shoe area. I haven't been working there that long, but at the store, customers have to wait in line in order so workers can scan the shoes on a device and get them out of the stockroom. Before, customers could walk up to any worker and ask them to scan their shoes. But the policy has changed recently to them waiting in line. 

Today, I was walking past the line to scan shoes when the lady at the front called me. She was trying to talk to one of my coworkers, but she only spoke Spanish. My coworker doesn't speak any Spanish, but I do, so I asked her how I could help. She told me the shoe size she wanted, and so I told my coworker. My coworker already had her size, but she was telling him something in Spanish, and because he didn't understand, that's why she called me. She asked me why the line system had changed, and being a brand new employee, I asked him. He started to tell me why, but as he was telling me so I could translate for her, (all of the conversation between her and I was in Spanish) she said ""You have to tell me!"". So I explained to her that I'm new, so I didn't know about the change, but I then told her the reason my coworker gave. 

After I told her, my coworker went to the stockroom to find her shoes for her. Then she started to rant about how she was busy, and that she didn't have time to wait all day. She told me how stupid it was how she had to get back in line for each shoe she wanted scanned. I suggested to her that perhaps it would be better to find all the shoes she wanted, and then wait to scan all of the shoes. She didn't really respond to that, instead reiterating how stupid the store's system was. 

She started yelling, and everyone in the shoe section was looking at her. I tried to calm her down, apologizing for the wait, but nothing's working. She continues ranting about how busy she is, and periodically she keeps snapping her fingers at me and telling me to bring me her shoes. My coworker already had told her that he would bring her shoes to her, but anything that I told her seemed to go through one ear and out the other, because even though I would tell her that my coworker was bringing the shoes, she kept telling me to get them for her. 

My manager, who was at one of the registers saw that the customer was getting riled up, and so she called me from across the room to send the woman over. I told the customer to come with me, but she wouldn't budge. I explained to her that my manager would be able to help her with whatever she needed. She just kept asking me ""Why? Why are you making me get out of the line?"" So eventually my manager had to leave the register and walk over to us. 

I went on my lunch not too long after, and I spoke to the same coworker who got the customer's shoes when I came back. My coworker has been working at the store for a couple of years now, and he told me that he's never seen the manager get that overwhelmed before. The way I'm describing the story may not seem so intense, but this woman was getting wild.",0,1623218054
1436,"Sir, this isn't a repair shop","More tales from the big-box home improvement store. This happened today.

I'll be Me, manager will be M, and the customer will be CTG for Crazy Tool Guy.

One of the things we sell are power garden tools from various manufacturers, and we have some spare parts for them as well. That said, we don't have the means to repair tools in-store (our tool rental guys can run diagnostics, but that's only for tools that get returned to us for a refund and for the purposes of determining resale-ability), so it all has to be run through the manufacturer to get repairs as well as certain parts.

CTG calls in one morning over the phone. It's a slow day, so I answer the call. I don't remember *exactly* how the conversation went because he ranted at me a lot, but this was pretty much the gist of it.

CTG: ""I called in yesterday about a weed eater that I bought last year from your store that stopped working. I misplaced my receipt -"" (note: I think this was him wanting to prove that he bought it from us for repairs, which again we don't do) ""- and I was told that I'd need to send it to the manufacturer in (city that isn't us). Is there any faster way I can get it fixed?""

Now, while I already know the answer is going to be no, I put on my best Customer Service face and tell him that I'll put him on hold to ask M this question, just in case there's like a repair shop near us or something (I've only been working here like a month). Obviously, the answer is the same, and CTG will have to send it to the manufacturer. It's likely covered by the item's warranty given the timeline CTG provided, so he's more than fine here if it turns out to be a defect.

Me: ""I'm sorry, you will have to send the weed eater on to the manufacturer, we do not have a way to repair it here.""

This was evidently not the answer CTG was looking for:

CTG: ""Well that's bull****! I don't want to send off my weed eater to (city of manufacturer) and wait 4, 5 weeks to get it back! You're (name of store) and I bought it from you, you should be able to fix it!"" (he went on for like a minute ranting about this, but this was pretty much the gist of it!""

Me: ""I'm sorry that you've had that experience, but our store isn't set up to be able to repair tools here.""

CTG: *continues ranting and drops the fabled words ""I'm never buying from your company again"", eventually calms down and ends the call*

Me: “It’s a single purchase of 3499.99 or more”

C: “Well that just doesn’t make any sense! I only need a small freezer. Who is spending that much on appliances”

Me: “I have a fridge in the front that retails for 3599.99, plus people do kitchen remodels”

C: “Well I don’t need that much, why would you (referring to my company) offer this?”

Me: “Well that rebate is through the card, we aren’t even participating in that”

C: “Well they said to come in and speak with retailers for details. They said you’d have this”

1439,"Customers loves to say: ""But it's too heavy for me.""","So I work in a very known furniture-home interior shop and I have all kind of customers. Mostly I'm at the register and people just don't realize how many lifts we have during a shift and that we can - in total - lift the weight of 6 cars. Or how many times we need to bow down to scan bigger items. So I get annoyed, just a tad, when a customer comes with their cart and there are like 3x30 plates of different sizes. I politely ask them to put it on the counter, because I need to count them. Their answer is: ""But it's too heavy for me and I know there are 30 of these, 30 of these and 30 of these."" I politely tell them I need to count them all. They proceed to ask why I can't count them in the cart. I'll always be like: ""I prefer to not strain my back too much and leaning over the cart to count those three piles would certainly do that. You might think it sounds ridiculous, but you're not the only customer to ask this of me and if I were to do so ten times each hour, then how do you think my back would feel at the end of an 8 hour shift?"" They always look dumbfolded at me and then they put the plates on the counter for me to count.

Or when the customers don't read the flat carts, where it says: 'Please place your items with easy access to the barcode.' They just put their box items on there in a complete disorder and often even places heavier boxes above the barcodes of other items. They get so angry when I politely tell them to remove the boxes so I can scan the items beneath and then pulls out a list, saying: ""I have all on this list, so just use this to finish up."" I always reply with: ""Sorry, I can't do that. It's against our policy and I need to scan the items, so please remove them so I can scan those beneath.""

The worst part is when they put their items on the counter in one big pile. I very politely tell them to place everything in one line and point to a note stating just how much weight we lift through a day (the 6 cars). Most are understanding, some gets very annoyed, but I refuse to start scanning items, until the customers does as I ask of them. I have *one* body and I need to take care of it. I've already strained my shoulder twice, because I didn't ask the customers to help me.

So please, everyone, think about the people working, when you're shopping. You might not have much, but they do this for hours on every single day. It puts a lot more strain on the body than you think. I don't think it's too much to ask for and I hope you agree and will be more helpful to the employees.

1477,"If you're rude and refuse to pay, we have the right to refuse services, even after they're done","So I was in the shop one day, a customer was in getting some keys copied, nice and simple job. Suddenly while I've got the machine running, some shirtless guy comes in looking really frantic. I tell him I'll be just a minute longer, then I finish the keys, and send the first customer on his way.

Frantic dude: ""jeez, took you long enough, I need you to come unlock my car""

I'm already a little annoyed since its almost closing time, but I just figure he's got a kid/dog/groceries in the car and give him the benefit of the doubt.

Me: ""No problem, where is it?"" FD: ""A couple miles that way, my girlfriend drove me over here. You can follow us to it.""

I get some info from him, the kind of car it is, his name/number/address in case we get separated, etc.

FD: ""My phone's in the car so if you call it I won't answer"" Me: ""Then how about your girlfriend's number?"" FD: ""Hers is in there too""

Well ok then

Since it's pretty much closing time, I just go ahead and set the alarm and lock the doors as I leave, he doesn't like this and starts saying how I'm taking forever. Yeah yeah, take a chill pill, 5 extra seconds won't kill you.

I get in my truck and follow him out there, when we get there I grab my tools and head to the car. Surprisingly, there's nothing in there except for the keys on the seat. No kids or dogs, so now I'm just hoping it's actually their car.

FD: ""You'd better not mess up my doors, this is a classic""

Yeah, a classic Ford POS

I open it up in about 10 seconds and check the insurance card, and yup it's their car. I pick up the keys and go over to him, tell him it's $40, and he just looks at me dumbfounded.

FD: ""Wait you mean I have to pay for this?""

Ummm, yeah?

Me: ""Yes sir, we charge a service call when we have to go out to the location."" FD: ""Well I'm not paying for that, you did it in 10 seconds, I could've done that myself if I'd have known"" Me: ""Well I'm sorry, but I can't do this for free.""

I could've, but there was no real urgency like a life endangered, plus he was rude about the whole thing. We normally would just bill someone in the situation, but we've been burned too many times, so we'll only do that for companies.

FD: ""I'm not paying for that, I don't have any money"" Me: ""Then if you think you can do it yourself, go for it.""

I throw his keys in the car, lock the doors, shut it behind me, and leave. I get home about ten minutes later, then after probably an hour he calls back.

FD: ""I can't get it open, come back and open my car again"" Me: ""I can go out again, but I'll have to charge you for two service calls."" FD: ""F- you A-hole, I'm not paying you 80 bucks"" Me: ""Then you can call out other locksmith nearby, I'm sure he'll be happy to help y-"" click

""Would I get a better deal with the $20 a purchase of over 80 or the 20% off one item

""Well your largest item is over $100 so that gets you the better deal""

""Do you go to X university?""

""No?""

""Ok""

And then she proceeds to check my math for 5 minutes (I don't know why it took her so long) and I had to call someone to hook on another register because the line was getting long.

She finally agrees that 20% off the &gt;100$ item is more than $20 and pays.

1480,"Guy said her car was only worth $2,000 because of a squeaking door!","Hey guys! Long time lurker, first time poster!

I used to manage a oil change shop. I was actually working by myself that day as I had the slowest store in the company.

I had an older Chinese lady (probably mid to late 60s) pull into my parking lot in a decent looking car. She spoke some English but you could tell it wasn't her first language. She seemed upset

Now this happened at least like 8 or 9 years ago so I don't remember specifically what was said but this is roughly how it went down.

Me: Hi, how are you?

Lady: Can you help me?

Me: Sure, what can i do for you?

Lady: Guy said car is junk, and will give me $2,000 for it and idk what to do...

So I take a gander outside and see her car. It was a 5 or 6 year old VW Jetta. Not new by any means but looks worth more that 2k.

Me: Whats wrong with it?

Lady: Its running rough, and the door squeaks.

So I take a look under the hood and the Mass Air Flow Sensor was unplugged. Plugged it back in and applied some WD40 to the hinges. Start it back up and it runs perfect.

I went back inside and told her I fixed it but I wanted to blue book her car for her so she knew what it was worth. Car came up and as being worth about $7,500. I told her that guy was trying to rip you off and not to trust him.

She told me that a guy she brought it to told her that the engine was junk and was only going to get worse, and that her door was about to fall off! Whoever this was clearly saw she knew nothing about her car and would be easy to manipulate, and tried to flip her car for a nice payday!

I told her your car is fine and if you need ANYTHING you come and see me! She started crying and gave me a hug and went on her way. Didn't charge her a dime. Coolest moment in my many years of customer service!",0,1622908979

There wasn't much to do so I decided to walk around maybe reorganized misplaced items when suddenly a kid (maybe 3-4 years old) holds my hand. I kind of look around to see if someone lost their kid and then I see a young lady gave me a ""go on"" gesture. I'm a bit confused as what she wants me to do but whatever I was bored and this kid looked cooler than my friends. So I asked if he liked candy and asked which one he liked. He didn't say anything and just pointed to some gummy worms.

Me: That's cool. Me too! I like the sour ones because I can make this face. sour face

This made the kid laugh

Boy: I love you daddy hugs me

TBH I freaked out a bit and thought this kid couldn't possibly be mine as I looked over to the young lady she started tearing up.

Me: I love you too, son

The boy ran back to the lady

The lady walks up to me and hugs me

Lady: I'm so sorry for that, my husband just passed away 2 days ago. This is the first time I saw him talk since that day.

Me: I'm sorry for your loss

Lady: Thank you

They proceeded to leave. The boy is waving his gummy worms at me and I do the sour face and he does the same.

Edit: Wow, didn't expect this to go as big as it did. Thanks for the gold strangers and thank you people for the kind words.",0,1622908803
1482,Old guy yells at me while I help his wife pick out a vibrator.,"So, if the title and my post history isn’t self explanatory I work in a sex store. The stories I could tell just from my year here could fill a book, particularly because I work in a rather “methy” small town in Canada.

I also work late shifts most nights so, it gets Interesting.

Anyways tonight I had 2 fine glossy eyed specimen enter my store and they set off a few retail red flags immediately, so I kept an eye out, but offered my assistance and didn’t bother them while they looked around. For some context, everything in my store is under a magnet lock so I have to come over and unlock whatever product they are wanting off the hook. They asked me to come grab a few items off the wall and put them behind the counter while they continued to browse.

As I head back to the counter I hear a tell tale cardboard rip and see that the lady had ripped a box of lingerie off the hook and was examining it. (While swaying drunkenly mind you) I walked over and gently asked for it back from her so I could tape the product back up since the box was all mangled now and she didn’t want it. As I’m turning around to do this she rips off another one.

I turn around and calmly say “Hey could you just be careful not to rip the merchandise off? I can grab anything if you want to look at it.” She apologized immediately and slurred that she was just trying to see the back, I told her it was not an issue. (probably just heavy drunk hands) So I took both items back behind the counter to fix.

As I did this, Drunk hubby walks up to the counter and raises his voice at me as his wife continues to look around

(Side note, I’m incredibly upbeat and cheery, that’s just naturally how I am and It works great to de-escalate situations. So imagine me genuinely smiling and being helpful through all this)

Drunk: D Wife: W Me: M

D: We’re not spending anymore fucking money here. We would but we don’t wanna buy anything else from you.”

M: “Because I asked her very nicely to be careful with the products?”

D: “ ITS NOT LIKE SHE DID IT ON PURPOSE!!! I’m coming back tomorrow to speak to your boss!”

Me: “okay for sure feel free!! I’m just doing my job making sure stuff doesn’t get damaged. Anything else I can help you with?” (my boss will honestly probably tell the guy to fuck off)

D: “NO. We’re leaving. “

W: looking intently at the wall of vibrators “Wait hold on I like this one”

D: “Babe lets go, we’re fucking LEAVING. NOW”

W: looking at 3 different vibrators “Wait”

D: (practically screaming at this point) NO. NOW.

M: “Can I help you choose from any of those?”

D: “I SAID WERE FUCKING GOING NOW”

W: “One more minute. Does this one recharge?”

Me: “No, not that one! But I do have this one over here that’s 40% off and is rechargeable :)”

W: “It comes in pink?”

Me: “Yup right here!”

W: “And waterproof? “

M: “Absolutely! “

W: “Yeah I’ll take that! “

So he stands with his arms crossed and brows furrowed while I grab the products for them, then he has to fork over $350 for all the stuff they grabbed. I happily bagged it all and asked all the basic questions, followed up by my best wishes for a lovely evening. And smiled because he didn’t say another word and I make commission :) I’m honestly really looking forward to seeing if he tries to contact my boss tomorrow

Oh and I took down his license plate and gave 911 a lil tip there’s a possible drunk guy in a big truck who just left the sex shop :))

EDIT: my boss messaged me to let me know if dude calls and tries to complain he’ll be asked kindly not to shop at our stores any more. My boss doesn’t put up with abuse of his staff and that’s why I love him.",0,1622908427

Anyway, we're chilling in the tech support room watching the stock market, since it's a calm morning, and we get a ticket.  I believe it was from a parent, I don't recall.  Anyway, the ticket reads like ""What is [random faculty member]'s job?"".  We all kind of looked at each other like *what*, and the head IT guy for the school said ""What am I, the faculty manager?"".  We just began laughing.  We get a lot of obscure tickets and phone calls from parents but this one was especially strange, since we don't have any ability to see who does what.  Not to mention, parents aren't supposed to submit tickets (it's for faculty only) since we have a parent hotline instead.  Some parents get ahold of the link somehow though, and submit tickets.  Even so, this ticket wasn't even remotely related to tech services.

1503,Another side of tech support,"TL/DR at the Bottom:

The company I work for has a service/lease agreement with the company I physically work at.  Every 3-4 years the Laptops/Desktops get replaced with newer equipment when the lease is up and our group usually has to track them down if they aren't in their assigned locations.  Usually policy is that if laptops are left on desks they need to be secured via cable lock to the desk, but desktops being more bulky this isn't the policy.

I get tasked with trying to locate and swap out a device one day and finally come across it on a desk near, but not exactly where it should be.  Unhooking all the peripherals I notice someone attached a cable lock to the desktop, so I have to contact the on site security team to unlock the cable lock, which usually isn't an issue but of course I was in a hurry this day so it was a calamity in it's own.  Conversation goes a little like: SG(security guard), Me, RM(random manager).  

SG arrives 30 minutes after making the request for assistance (typical)

SG: ""Did you call for assistance with a cable lock?""

Me: ""Sure did.""

SG: ""Is this your computer?""

Me: ""It's my companies, yes.  I just need to swap it out with this other one I have here.""

SG: ""Who sits at this desk?""(pointing to empty desk with PC on it)

Me: ""I'm not sure, I just know that this device is past due to be replaced and that's why I'm here.""

SG: ""Well I need the permission of the person that sits here for you to take the machine.""

Me: ""It doesn't belong to whoever sits here, this device belongs to my company (shows him the work order with the computer ID of the one that is on the desk and the one that I'm trying to swap it out with) I just need you to unlock the cable lock so I can put this one here and then I'll secure the new one if that really makes a difference, though it shouldn't have been locked in the first place.""

SG: ""Well all the devices should be secured to the desks.""

Me: ""That's never been the policy for desktops, but I just need this unlocked.""

SG: ""I'm going to need a manager of this area to approve that this device is ok to take.""

Me: \*sigh\* ""I don't know where any managers are for this area, I don't work for *comapnyname* I work for *othercompany* and have other things I need to get done today as well.""

SG: \*walks off to find a company manager\*

RM/SG *returns*

RM: ""What's going on now?""

Me: ""I work for *othercompany (point to security badge with othercompany name)* I need to swap this machine out, it's past its replacement date (show paperwork again).""

SG: ""I need to know who sits at this desk to make sure this guy can take the machine.""

RM ""This is a 1st shift worker desk and he's not here now, but what do you need them for?  This guy(me) has the paperwork for the exchange.""

SG: ""Ok, I didn't want to get in trouble handing a device over to the wrong person......."" (looks at key ring) ""Oh I don't have the right key to unlock that cable lock, I have to call my supervisor to bring the other set of keys.""  *15 minutes later supervisor shows up with the keys and unlocks the device.*

A simple 15-20 minute task is now taking over an hour and a half because of stupidity, and the security guard mentioned that he was retired law enforcement for the state at some point during this which just makes it even more aggravating.

&amp;#x200B;

TL/DR: Over cautious security guard makes my life more difficult by not understanding the business relationship between mine and his company even with proper paperwork and credentials being shown.",1,1636682934

1507,Tale of two titties,"This was awhile back.  I was working for a small company, whose bread and butter was online retail sales. Onboard Raid died on the sole physical IIS host the website ran on. Replacement board had about a three-week lead time…  Dept. Head(Tit 1) recommended replacing the server, but even then, the store would be down for a week or two, and we’d have to get the $Vendor to setup their proprietary software; This in itself would have been expensive. As the owner(Tit 2) is flipping his shit, I peeked at the server and notice it just had two hard drives, and wondered how lucky I was that day. I plugged the drive into a normal SATA port, turned it on, and the server booted right on up web server and all. We got super lucky that the server was running Raid1, and that the stars aligned. I got a bunch of atta-boys, and I recommended right then and there that we just replace the server since it was already about 5 years old at that point.

Two years later I get called in early because the very same server, that was left as is, had failed to come back up after a reboot.  By the time I got there the owner and Dept. head are arguing about whose fault it was between them, and they ask me if there’s anything I can do. By that point I was aware that all the important bits, including the db, were hosted on a different server.  I popped open the case, moved the cable from the bad drive to the second drive that hadn’t been touched for two years, powered it back up, and everything worked fine… Other than being more then two years behind on updates. The server was replaced within a month after that.

I look under the desk to actually turn the computer on, and I regret not saying what I just now thought to say.

That still brings more questions, though. Where's the computer? Who sits here? Did somebody take it to their desk without actually swapping? Did someone steal an entire desktop? But most importantly: Do they think they're turning the computers off when they leave, but it's actually just the monitors? Have these computers been running all day, every day?

All the other students, and the computer class teacher, found it amusing, but we never found out what happened to the computer. I didn't, at least. We did lose a computer from the comp sci class, at one point, though... MY computer. For like a week, I didn't realize it wasn't my computer, but that's for the comments.",1,1636594907
1511,This is going to suck...,"Just got this email.

""I had a bit of a mishap with one of my monitors.  My cat got the handle of a bag caught around his neck and FREAKED OUT, ran behind my computer desk, under my other desk, tore across the house (all with the paper bag still attached), and now is now parked in a corner of the bathroom on top of a shelving unit, determined that the world is out to get him.

As a result of this excitement, one of my monitors won’t turn on. No light on the front, even.  But the computer is still recognizing it as there.  I tried to make sure that all the plugs had good connections (power and video) and restarted my computer, but no luck.

Any suggestions are appreciated.  Thank you!""

Get a ticket for a user that can't access email. I figure it's either an account problem or connection issue. Well, it was definitely a connection issue alright.

  


User states Outlook says disconnected. He also says his wifi says ""connected, no internet"". However, he can still browse google and othee websites.

  


I'm very curious at this point. One way to find out, let's try to remote in. Sure enough, i get connected to his machine just fine. Connected, no internet.

1517,Haunted Computers,"Today's on-site visit reminded me of an older story of mine. I don't think I've told the second one on here before. Here's both stories:

Part 1 - I got called out to an office today because the capslock was working backwards. I remoted in and watched the problem occur, turned off all of those pesky accessibility options to no avail, before deciding to head out with a new keyboard. Upon arrival, I found out that the laptop in question wasn't using an external keyboard - even though there was a keyboard tray under the desk with a keyboard... and a book... and a stethoscope on top of it. I unplugged that keyboard and her problems went away. I offered to sprinkle some holy water on things but they didn't want to pay extra for the whole exorcism...

Part 2 - The flashback - as I left their office, I was mentally transported back in time several years ago to a hair salon. They kept complaining that their Macs were losing internet randomly during the day. For 6 months we labored on this. We replaced the router and added new Wi-Fi access points. If Wi-Fi radiation was ionizing, they would all have brain cancer - the coverage was that good. I had constant connectivity monitoring going on so when they would complain, I could jump on and see what dropped where - except nothing ever did. And by the time I got by their shop, everything was always working fine. I finally started randomly dropping in, hoping to catch the gremlin unawares.

And I did. One afternoon, as I popped in, a gal said ""hey! It's happening!"" I quickly rushed to the bathroom and changed into my Superman Underoos and then flew, clumsily, to the front desk. It was happening!

Hmm - Wi-Fi shows good. I can still pibg the computer. All access points are up. Why can't I left-click on anything? That's weird. I can right-click... That's weirder... I plug a corded mouse in - same issues. I manage to get the Bluetooth menu open - a lot of stuff in there. I turn off Bluetooth - everything works! Except that the Mac next to me begins to exhibit the same issues... The mystery deepens...

After lots of sleuthing, I finally decided that there had to be another mouse in this building. I began digging through the front counter - nothing. Back office - nothing. Owner's office - nothing. The girls were snickering at my Superman Underoos - I ignored them - they wouldn't know fashion if it bit them. I finally told the owner my suspicion and she casually mentions, ""oh, I've got some old mice in the bottom of my purse.""

Now, I may be dressed as a Tech Superman, but I'm not going through a woman's purse. Especially a woman who looks like she could ""femininely"" bench press me several times without breaking a sweat. She retrieved the mice and I confirmed that they were the Evil Rogue Mice Twins. They would sit in the bottom of her purse waiting to be set down just right so that they could click, wake up, and connect to the unsuspecting computer. I took their batteries out and banished them.",1,1636518712
1518,Lady doesn't trust me to remote into the computer I built and assigned to get,"Quick backstory here: I work in the physical therapy industry and am part of a team supporting around 1,300 individual clinics. Each clinic we support is part of our company; we aren't third party in any way. We either own these clinics or are in a partnership of some kind

 We buy laptops and desktops and configure them before shipping them out to new users and clinics. Part of our configuration is installing log me in and another remote access software. 

So I'm working here for about six months and I get a call from a receptionist lady that I'll refer to as RL. The conversation goes as such...

Me: [company name] help desk, this is me.

RL: Uh hello? My computer isn't working

Me: I see, is the computer turning on? What is the issue with it?

RL: It turns in but I don't know what's wrong, can you fix it?

Me: No problem I should be able to help. Let me take a look, what's the identification number so I can start a remote session?

RL: It is most certainly a problem. I don't know who you are and I can't just let you into my computer!

Me: I'm sorry I'm just trying to trouble shoot what the problem may be and I can't get a good idea of that over the phone.

RL: Well you can't connect to my computer, I don't trust you. I need to speak with my manager about this

At this point im a little frustrated but trying to stay professional and not blurt it ""Lady, this is our computer, I can connect any time I please"". She puts me on hold for about fifteen minutes while she speaks to the clinic director; I'll reference them as CD. CD picks up the phone

CD: Hello? This is [their name]

Me: Hello, my apologies for any confusion. I was helping RL with an issue she was having in her computer and she was worried about me connecting to get computer.

CD: You need to fix it right? Go ahead and remote into it, I'll talk to RL about it.

Turns out that CD was shocked at his receptionists attitude towards me and ended up apologizing for it. I fix the issue and go about my day and a couple days later 8 see a termination notice come in for RL; my boss and I had a good laugh about it

For context I've worked at this place for over two years now and I can count on one hand how many people have been rude or hostile towards me",1,1636517073
1519,The day I got Joe,"I'm not sure if this fits here since it's only sort of tech support, but here goes...

This story takes place around 2005, about 15 years before I started actually working in IT.  At the time I was a department lead in one of the processing plants for a large photography company.  My department was responsible for very basic retouching of pictures in Photoshop using Wacom tablets, entry level stuff that doesn’t require any previous experience.  I had a 70+ year old guy in my department who basically only worked there to keep busy after retiring from his real career.  We’ll call him Joe.  

While Joe wasn’t a computer tech, he was very comfortable with computers and knew a TON about Photoshop.  I learned a lot from him over the years.  Joe also had a great sense of humor and was the type of person who could talk circles around anyone he met.  When he chose to poke fun at someone, which he did often, they usually didn’t even know he was joking around with them until several minutes later because he was so quick on his feet.  All this meant that it was extremely satisfying that one time I actually got the better of Joe!

I was always the go-to guy to fix computer issues in my department and the several departments that were near mine when people didn't want to open a ticket.  One day Joe calls me over and says he’s having trouble with his Wacom tablet.  

Joe: Hey, every time I try to use the healing brush it just leaves this big white smear instead.

Me: Oh, I’ve seen this before, I know exactly how to fix it.  This is going to sound weird, but just bear with me.

Joe: Ok…

Me: First, set down the stylus and stand up.

He sets the stylus down on his desk and stands up, expecting me to sit down and take over. Instead I take a step back.

Me: Ok, now here’s the weird part.  I want you to turn around in a full circle until you’re facing the computer again. Trust me, this always works.

He gives me this incredulous look, like I’ve lost my mind.  But he goes along with it.

Me: Perfect, now sit back down and try again.

Joe: But you didn’t do anything!

Me: Just try it.  Like I said, this always works.

He proceeds to pick up the stylus, try again, and when it works he looks at me like I just pulled a rabbit out of his ear.  That’s when I tell him he was holding the stylus upside down and when he sat back down and picked it up he was holding it correctly that time.  In Photoshop if you’re hold the Wacom stylus upside down it automatically uses the eraser tool instead of whatever tool you have selected.  I know for a fact that Joe knew this, since he’s the one that taught it to me, but that day it just didn’t dawn on him for whatever reason.",1,1636498023

1527,An eternal grudge over the simplest of errors,"$DC = Me
$Phyllis: the lady who trains people on 
the circuit board in question
$Cam = another coworker, basically an ""extra""
in this story

I used to work at a place that made circuit 
boards and modules for industrial automation
and monitoring. I tested newly-made boards,
and troubleshot any failures. I would do simple
through-hole resolders, and send surface
mount jobs to the ""surgeons"" who could
deal with the surface mount resoldering or
part replacements.

I was testing a board which had analog and digital I/O,
which had it's own microcontroller chip.
We tested that board with a test fixture that
was connected to the desktop computer.
Essentially the test fixture provided all the
necessary voltages, and simulated inputs
on command from the computer's test software.

At this point I had been working with the set
for about a week. The test software throws
an error that says ""could not communicate
with the board being tested"" so I look closely
at the board itself for visible defects in
specific areas that would prevent the board
from powering up or communicating.
Not finding anything, I try again. Same error.
So I set this one aside and try another board
to see if the issue was with our setup, or the
actual board itself. Same error. 

Okay, definitely a test fixture or computer issue.
Of course, I look to the coworker, $Phyllis, who showed
me how to do these boards but she is busy
discussing something with another person.
So, I go ahead and try the first thing we have
all learned to do first when troubleshooting 
any application: close and reopen the application itself. 
Upon reopening, it apparently doesn't ""remember""
which file it had open, but that's not a big deal.
I look in the most obvious places including the
network disk we have our test instructions in, along
with files that are necessary for testing or programming
a given board. Looking up the part number
for the board, or it's actual name in words, 
does yield a folder and test instructions,
but no test file/program, and the test
instructions for the technician don't mention
where the file should be. 

So, I go over to $Phyllis and her coworker to 
ask her to come help ""when she has a minute""
and she immediately asks what I need, and I
ask where the test program file is, because I
had to reset the software and it didn't 
reopen the file. She was rather snappy
when she asked why i didn't just go and get
her rather than messing with the computer.
I said, because you were talking to someone.
Then she's like ""it doesn't matter, just let me
know if you have a problem, there's no point
messing with it when I'm around""
Instead of arguing with $Phyllis, I take out
my notebook with the intent to write down
the location of the file so I can find it again.

What I failed to look for is a ""recent files"" list
but that wasn't in a menu with a name
that was obvious to someone not familiar
with that software. Naturally, that's what 
$Phyllis used to reopen the test program.
However, she did it too fast for most people
to follow what she was doing.
I did see where it was, but
just in case the ""recent files"" thing didn't work
due to some glitch, or the program got updated
by engineering to a newer version, I asked 
where the actual file would be, with my 
notebook in hand so she knew that it was for
future reference if the problem needed fixing
again in the future. 
Of course, $Phyllis just said to just come 
back and ask her for help if the software
has any trouble again. Not wanting to 
make a big deal about it and turn it into
an argument, I just let it go.

About 5 months later, $Phyllis is training
$Cam on the same circuit board. When she
gets to the point of discussing the actual
test software, she brings up the time that
$DC tried to fix a failure to communicate
by restarting the test program itself. 

Although it's not evident from the story, it
literally took less than a minute for $Phyllis
to reopen the file and it took basically no
additional effort beyond that. And yet, somehow
she was still pissed at me about it, 5
months later. This post wouldn't have even been worth writing if it wasn't for that.

TL;DR: trainer holds an eternal grudge over
a generic troubleshooting attempt that
did no harm in the end.",1,1636400260

Starring:

Me, LC - local contact

Background:

I work partially as a consultant in enterprise networking. Had a customer send in a support ticket as he'd spent some time troubleshooting because a pad and a voip system weren't connecting to the network. The LC had managed to troubleshoot the pad to some configurations on the switch and had solved this, but was unable throughout the couple of hours he had been working on this issue to get the voip to work.

Story time:

I get to LC's location before the morning coffee has graced my lips so the first half of our meeting is spent mostly deflecting from showing how unconscious I am by asking habitual troubleshooting questions. Other devices in the same room work, configuration is correct, the pad is functioning but no matter what, the voip device just won't power on. Oh, it needs PoE btw. Huh... 

By the time I get to see the switch everything is connected to, I'm barely capable of recognizing what the damn thing is let alone how to connect to it. I eventually get there after staring at the console port in the back for some 30 seconds and find no issues on the switch itself, no limitations, no capacity (2 ports of 24 in use) issues, just nothing.

Step 2 is to get to the room where the voip device is located. I flip the device to see where the ethernet cable is connected... The device has 2 ethernet ports. Huh2. I can see the tiny label on the empty ethernet port (the other one is being obscured by the cable): ""LAN IN"". Huh\_v.3.0. Several questions as to what has been troubleshot on the device itself followed. Well no troubleshooting was done exactly on it, cause the cable is stuck and there are no other lan ports available on the wall. Aha. Queue some 5 min of trying to jiggle, wiggle and coax the damn RJ45 out. No go? Rip it bayblade style (not recommended). That works, the cable comes out sans damage to itself or the device. The newly empty port where the cable was stuck is labeled ""LAN OUT"". Aha2. Plug cable into ""LAN IN"" port. Device comes online. Check to see if it calls, if the mic works, if the traffic goes out the building. Aha\_v.3.0.

Guy seemed fairly sheepish at what had happened. I comforted him that even the most hardened professionals make these types of mistakes sometimes. Cool dude all in all.

It's officially been one full week since my brother died. Massive heart attack, I felt his pulse disappear. He was an avid photographer, known around our entire county, and an truly intelligent person. He was my family's ""tech guy"", a role that now falls to me, this is where I come in. Because he was such an avid photographer, my parents wanted access to his computers to try and pull some of the many thousands of pictures he's taken. But he didn't keep any of his passwords or hints in his safe. They asked me if I could try to get in, to avoid having to pull the drives and potentially lose something.

I went to work trying to find some way of breaking in and removing those passwords, eventually I found a way, which I will not be detailing here. All I will say is I managed to change some file names and got a method of changing the passwords of all accounts on the computer, as well as his laptop.

My parents nearly fell apart when I told them I'd managed to get in without disrupting any data whatsoever.

This entire ordeal has firmly planted a desire to engage in a profession within the IT field. I know from reading the stories here it won't all be sunshine and daisies, but if I can ever help another family like I was able to help mine, I want to try.

I apologize if this is poorly written, or maybe doesn't fit here, but I needed to tell it, to remind people, jobs in IT may be hell, but maybe the person on the other end of your line is going through the worst pain imaginable, losing a child that had so much promise.

So I e-mail the sponsor directly to ask if they have an actually usable version of the logo, rather than a scanned business card.

I receive a new file shortly; a new PDF… of the same card, only this time it’s crooked *and* upside down.

So I reply again, emphasizing that I need the logo as a proper image; a scan of the business card is useless to me.

I get a new response: a scan of the same card, slightly straighter, but still upside down.

It was at that point I conceded defeat and just used the first crappy version… ‘cause I know my boss would have been strongly disapproving (while laughing her butt off) if I actually asked the sponsor in question if they had a second-grader there I could speak to…

1546,Why you shouldn't use free trials in production,"It's been years since I last posted here. I guess we all end up coming back to IT, no matter how much we try to get away from it. Anyways, here's one from a few years back

It's a nice day in the office. We had recently been moved from in-house office space to WeWork and certainly appreciated the free coffee and the plentiful chairs. I was sipping my after lunch coffee (half and half) when my IM pinged

&gt;$Analyst: Hey $Me how's it going? You got a second? I have an issue with this link, it should be loading &lt;report&gt; but it's not working anymore

&gt;$Me: Yeah sure, let me take a look

So I click the link and it indeed doesn't work anymore. I thought, hey, someone probably messed up the permissions system, let's check it out. So I load the admin interface to look at it... and it's not loading either. Huh.

    &gt;ping &lt;server IP address&gt;
    [...]
       Packets: Sent = 4, Received = 4, Lost = 0 (0% loss)

Ok so the server isn't down. That's... good? I decide to check if I can log into the DB engine, and it also works. Right, time to see if my boss knows what it might be.

&gt;$Me: Hey boss, what's up? You know if we're having a general issue with the reporting tool? I can't access it.

Well, he'll take at least 20 minutes to reply, so I can go get some more coffe-*ping*

&gt;$Boss: Hey $Me, uhhh turns out my predecessor left out a trial version installed and never actually requested to buy the license. It just ran out the 180 days trial period and it'll take at least a week to get a license bought. I'm gonna go down to the floor and try to rescue the report files, wanna give it a try too?

&gt;$me: Can I get another coffee before getting on with it?

&gt;$Boss: Sure, see you in the floor in 5

So after I got another coffee, I started to scour the server filesystem to find... nothing. Not a trace of the three hundred report files we had created since we started the tool migration six months ago. Perhaps more coffee wasn't good for the panic that's setting in now. Okay, just breathe and think about it.

After some Googling, it turned out the report files aren't actual files in a folder, but are stored within a table on the DB engine. Thankfully, the table was still there and accessible to my account, so after a couple hours of going down the rabbit hole of how the tables were structured, a few queries, and a PowerShell script (and some iterations of trial and error) I managed to recover the entire folder structure with report files and have everything ready to import to the other DB engine where IT had just finished installing the reporting tool server... which was also a trial license, but this time it was only until the order for the full license came through. At least nothing was lost... except the permissions for each report and folder, which did take us the better part of the following day to recreate.

But I didn't have to let my coffee grow cold, so that was a win I suppose",1,1636053492

1550,"Anyway, I pressed Reset.","Found this sub yesterday, glad I can move away from the ComputerStupidities I keep reading and confess part of my days.

The guy left, and anyway I don't care about what he would say, so:

Lunch time, was at the refectory. That user came by and quietly told me ""Computer froze like five times, I pressed reset every time and now it doesn't boot"". I know this guy does not like working too long (as many out there), so if he tells me at midday then the machine was down since the early morning (or the yesterday evening).

No ticket yet and my lazy ass down, I went by after 1:30pm. Sure enough, booting leads to a black screen, not even a bios.

This machine was fairly recent : 2015, brand new PCI/ISA backplane (great!), a shiny parallel card (love it!), two frontal USB ports (awesome!) and \*\*even\*\* a motherboard with SATA support (incredible!) with a platine-plated SSD with its antivibration kit (what?) for our trusty Windows XP. Yes 'we' love dead technologies.

No way to boot this thing back, so I took one spare motherboard and started to change it on site (because this darn thing was really difficult to take out); this is the king of MB with jumpers everywhere and original ones were hot-glued, highly maintainable. Nope, does not work: BSOD on startup (thanks XP for keep rebooting while BSOD, had to google how to stop it).

\*User: So?

\*Me: Well, by resetting it looks like you finished the motherboard, and the hard drive too.

\*User: When this will be fixed? Because I'll need to tell it at the morning meeting.

\*Me: I think tomorrow morning.

I went to take the necessary tools to take off the PC and replace entirely with a spare because that was the easiest way before fixing the old ones, I found the maintenance coordinator and told him about the ""press reset to kill"" thing. He was pretty fine about the troubleshoot. I put the PC on the workbench and transferred the cards into the new machine and restored a backup into the new disk. Looks fine, went back home.

Tomorrow came. I had to take some pills so I was stoned; I usually don't really care about what peoples I don't like says, so it was even worst. I put the new machine and started plugging everything (all hail profibus, eight 9d-sub and many outdated things) when the guy went angry enough to yell at me.

\*User: Hey you told that was MY fault because I reset multiple times BUT I told you I reset ONLY ONE time and your job is repairing not blaming (insert angry noises).

A random guy which loves to blame everyone came to support his point. I was like ""yeah go for it, life's good"" anyway. For unknown reasons an another guy went into corpse elimination, they quickly calmed down when I started explaining everything I knew. I'm a fun guy I swear. 

Restored disk didn't work, so I took a look on the BSOD error and, for once, I found an answer: wrong bios config for reading the disk. Had to change something I don't remember, so the old disk was fine. I claimed it has dead anyway, no one would care. It came back to life.

Reconfigure the address of the parallel port to detect the dongle, yell on Windows because old COM ports were hidden so new config started at COM9 instead of COM2... Everything was working except the network (new MAC address).

Because I was done with this I directly asked to the high-level guy to make the emergency request for network declaration (I don't have access to that for.) and this \*\*emergency\*\* request took three days and like five calls to get resolved. Finally everything went back on.

Pfiou.

1552,Compromised - Worst Nightmare to Greatness,"Some information removed or changed to protect identities, etc. Also, this posts discusses in high level detail an attack on our network. I was not the one to launch the attack (I was one of the defenders).

Within the government organization I led the internal IT Security Team, spearheading organization-wide changes to our security stance. Aside from the changes I was leading, we also had a contracted MSSP Team that monitored the network 24/7. The escalation point for ""serious"" or ""critical"" incidents was me. Barring me, it fell to the Senior Sys Admins in order of seniority.

For the previous couple weeks we'd seen a few other City governments be targeted by state-sponsored attackers based out of Russia. We were briefed by higher levels of Government. We constantly hammered at users for their training, and we weren't afraid to disable accounts until they completed it. But, users will always remain one of the weakest links in Security. Internally we had a sit down conversation about the ""what-ifs"". ""What if"" we are targeted? ""What if"" our MSSP catches it late? ""What if"" &lt;whatever&gt;? We had a conversation with our MSSP and re-highlighted escalation procedures.

1. Call me.
2. Failing that - call Sr. Sys Admins.
3. Failing that - call Management.
4. Failing that - call Dispatch.
   1. Explain who you are, why you're calling, what you need, and how quickly. Dispatch will handle the rest.

All was well and good. We went back to the grind of stripping old hardware, OSes (Guest + Hypervisors), Software, Networking gear. I had a sinking feeling in my stomach though. I knew something was coming, I had a good idea what it was. I didn't know when it would be. Now - our network, previously being old, and mostly insecure had come a long way. Most of our servers were onboard for long term monitoring, and had a modern EDR solution. More accurately, all of our servers had been replaced by modern systems. Except one.

One night (3AM) I get a phone call. It's from our MSSP.

$MSSP: ""Good Evening, it's $Tier1 from $MSSP calling.""

$Me: ""Haha, I don't think 'good evening' is a good use of words if you're calling at 3AM! I can appreciate the sentiment though. What's happened?""

$MSSP: ""There are currently 6 accounts in your network actively attacking hundreds of your servers from &lt;IP Range&gt;. Initial indication is they just gained access about 10 minutes ago.""

$Me: ""That IP range belongs to our full tunnel SSL VPN which is geo-restricted to our country. Where are these guys logging in from?"" (Unfortunately at the time, MFA wasn't being enforced at the VPN. Management was looking to spare a buck. Rest assured, multiple Senior Sys Admins threw books at them later.).

$MSSP: ""$MajorCityInCountry.""

$Me: ""We don't have anyone there right now. Send me an email ASAP with their usernames. I'll disable the AD user objects and kick the VPN sessions. Please run a search of the last 14 days for any VPN session that authenticated regardless of location. Group by the columns of Username, Source IP, and geographic location. Also, you mentioned exploits. Is this an attacker throwing shit at the wall and hoping something sticks? Run a second search please for our firewall, last 14 days, any UTM event that wasn't dropped/blocked. Export on Source IP/Port, Dest IP/Port, Username, UTM action and the UTM event itself.""

$MSSP: ""We'll export that information and have it over to you in the next 5 minutes. Anything else?""

$Me: ""Check the AV and EDR logs. There are plenty of shells that would make it through the UTM checks at the firewall that may be caught based on behaviour. If they attack FS01, they're going to find something.""

$MSSP: ""One just came in - meterpreter shell on FS01 to &lt;C2 IP&gt;. "". (Caught by non-EDR software. It was the last machine on a legacy AV. FS01 = File Server 01. Not it's real name, nor was it exclusively a file server.)

$Me: ""The one server you cannot touch from your console. Please call $SrSysAdmin1. If you can't get ahold of him try #2 and #3. If you can't get ahold of either, call me. Don't call the listed management, they're out of the country at the moment on vacation.""

$MSSP: ""Noted. Thanks!""

So I get logged into AD and kick the 6 users off. Reset their passwords, etc. I also brought down the VPN interface entirely. I set my focus on the server that had a shell (detected/prevented) on it. Now, this server was ancient. 'Ancient' actually means ancient. It would be legal age (18+) today if it were still running. If you haven't figured it out yet, a physical box running Windows (Storage Server) 2003. It was a huge liability but anytime someone, regardless of seniority even *thought* about taking a tablesaw to it, they'd get told off.

Now, being familiar with how pentests work, I knew they'd probably already dumped SAM and LSASS, making this a huge problem. Just as I cut the server off (that would've normally gotten someone fired), I get a call back from the MSSP.

MSSP: ""We weren't able to reach any of the Senior Sys Admin team.""

$Me: ""Forget the admin team, I'll handle it. FS01 is offline. Run a third search, all admin authentication activity from the last 24 hours. If these guys had any brains they dumped the SAM database and LSASS processes to get credentials.""

$MSSP: ""I'll send it over shortly. Just as a heads up, we have a couple Senior Security Analysts online. They're pouring over all your logs to find any other movement. They don't appear to have run any AD enumeration tools.""

$Me: ""Awesome. Who are the seniors on your side right now? I'll coordinate how we handle FS01's recovery with them.""

$MSSP: ""SrAnalyst1, 2 and 3.""

$Me: ""Noted. I need to make some phone calls to Dispatch, time to get chewed out, and wake the seniors up on our side.""

So I call dispatch. At dispatch they have special procedures for special requests... like critical IT staff getting police escorts back to IT HQ.

$Dispatch: ""9-1-1, where's your emergency?""

$Me: ""AV636 calling, priority. I need police dispatched to Sr Sys Admin 1, 2 and 3's houses immediately. Escort them to IT without delay. Unresponsive to phone calls. 6 user accounts compromised, with one critical server offline. Attackers are suspected to be the same group that hit $NearbyCities""

$Dispatch: ""Police will be dispatched. Was the critical asset FS01?""

$Me: ""Yes. Trust me when I say the alternative was much worse.""

$Dispatch: ""We need that server, now. Staff are already complaining.""

$Me: ""I understand what it's used for, but forget it. If I release the server back to it's normal operations I could very possibly cause the release of a threat internally. We will release it if, and only if, we can reasonably claim it's safe.""

$Dispatch: ""Fine. Police will arrive in a minute or two. You will get a call from IT staff once they're awake and in the patrol vehicles. Rest assured they will not be pleased that FS01 is offline.""

$Me: ""You're absolutely right - they won't be pleased about it. But they will definitely understand. Thank you for your assistance.""

$Dispatch: ""Keep us informed.""

A couple minutes later my phone rings, it's SrSysAdmin1.

$SSA1: ""Hey. What's going on?""

Me: ""Our Russian friends broke the front door down. 6 accounts compromised through the full tunnel VPN. I took the VPN interface offline on the firewalls. FS01 is offline following the detection of meterpreter shells.""

$SSA1: ""Fuck! Dispatch is going to be pissed. Have they gotten anything yet?""

$Me: ""No ransomware yet. \*knock on wood\* But the compromise of FS01 means that they likely dumped SAM and LSASS at the very least. Which means we should be at least resetting all admin passwords, and likely mass-resetting all domain passwords in general. (FS01 was a file server, jump box, and used by Public Safety). It'll be a lot of very pissed off users tomorrow, but it's a sure fire way of making sure they don't have additional credentials. It's also hard to say how many VPN accounts they have.""

$SSA1: ""Agreed. What about FS01? Dispatch will want that server online asap.""

$Me: ""They've been told to pound sand. This is the kick in the ass that they and management need. Time for FS01 to go. We got LUCKY that it was caught early, and someone got to it in time from our side. I'm damn inclined to say we can never fully trust it and transition to something on newer hardware, OS, software, and protected by the EDR.""

$SSA1: ""Playing with fire - I like it. Kick sand they will, management is out, and I'm next senior. I'll play dumb and just 'authorize' it in the frenzy.""

$Me: ""SSA2 and SSA3 will be here shortly. Let's throw up something modern, Server 2019, patch in the EDR, get the software interfaces for dispatch/public safety online by the end of the week. Dispatch can run both manual and the new system over the weekend. We won't have any issues getting SOC to stretch an investigation out for the next few days in the interest of security.""

$SSA1: ""I'll have that conversation with Dispatch. They're going to lose it when I tell them it's not coming back. Reach out to SOC's Seniors, get a list of every possible reason we can viably use to stretch out the downtime of FS01, just in case management wants a trail. Follow it up with a call to software vendors to get their support.""

$Me: ""Sweet. I'll get the PW resets underway using scripts. Then I'll start calling vendors.""

So we get the passwords reset for everyone. Yes, we had hundreds of pissed off users the next day. (Oh well...) SOC gave us a stupid long list of things to check. Naturally, it took 'days' to confirm the server was safe for use. By which time the new server was up and running. Dispatch was furious with us.

IT Management found out the next day of what happened, along with the fact that FS01 would be offline for ""extensive review"". A few days later we told management that FS01 was being replaced with 2 dedicated servers for dispatch/public safety. Both would run side-by-side. Two ran so that we could take one down for standard maintenance without interrupting their service. The file share side of FS01 for corporate was replaced by a significantly more modern server with faster/expanded storage. Jump box was moved to a dedicated jump box.

Sometimes you have to piss off users (or as they're called 'customers'). On the other hand,

1. Proper segregation of Corp and Public Safety. The last of the tied interfaces fell offline with FS01 kicking the metaphorical can.
2. VPN had MFA bought and enforced very quickly after that.
   1. Also a full audit of VPN permissions. Anything that had not been active in the last month was removed.
3. The ""purse strings"" loosened significantly immediately following the breach.
   1. (That's interesting... Normally when something is prevented, some asshat in C-Level or Council determines ""oh, they have enough money!"")

Nightmare: We were probably less than an hour away from losing FS01, followed by most of our environment. Multiple compromised accounts.

Greatness: It was the kick in the ass people needed to remove it permanently from service.",1,1635973919

So for some context I work in a broadband/TV/phone company in the technical department but I can also help on the billing side too to an extent.

A lady called in and immediately she didn't seem okay, she said we'd taken over £100 from her bank after she cancelled one of her services with her and that she was a single mother and no one had informed her we'd be taking that payment. Without that money she wouldn't be able to pay her bills, feed her kids or buy petrol for her car. 

At first glance the account seemed to be right; she'd only had broadband for a few months with us so of course there would be a fee, but she insisted she'd been with us longer and she was right! I found emails about her service that the account didn't say she had that she wouldn't of gotten if she didn't have it! She shouldn't of had any cancellation fees as there was even an email saying she was no longer in contract! It was a big system error that had caused it, and within my scope of digging up information.

I told her while I could make no promises at this time, I was going to escalate it to my manager and we were going to see if there was anything we could do. She was understandably worried but I promised her I would call her back. Armed with all the details I sent it all to my manager. Within an hour we had a response from the higher ups;

Give her her money back

Also knowing she didn't have much money in the account and it could take a few days my manager and I agreed we should give her a voucher for a supermarket so she could feed her kids and use the money she did have for emergencies until the money came in which could be sent immediately. I called her up and told her what we were going to do and the poor woman was nearly in tears. She thanked me but I thanked her for calling us and giving me all the information I needed to help her and that she'd done the right thing to chase this. 

Considering I had a very difficult call afterwards with another customer where I was sworn at and called 'a waste of space', I'm at least glad I managed to help her today.",1,1635971503

But hey, I was trapped at home with nothing better to do and getting paid to figure it out. It took a few days of research and cursing to cobble a system together, but in the end it worked. Most of the time. In fact it worked so ~~well~~ okay that my boss tasked me with setting everyone else up on it too. And that's when the problems started.

See, it just so happened my workplace and I had the same ISP, so it was very easy for our systems to communicate despite all the NAT involved. For everyone else I used some spare cycles on a VPS I was renting to relay all that traffic instead. Things worked great once I set that up. For everyone except Steve anyway...

For *months*, Steve made a point of telling me remote access didn't work for him any time we were both in earshot of our superiors. And every time I had the same response: ""Let me have a look at your laptop.""  But that laptop never came. I'm not going to lie, not only was I totally stumped by what the problem could be, I also stopped caring about it. Winter turned to spring, spring turned to summer and yet Steve's problem remained. 

One day I noticed an unusual charge on my credit card; I had forgotten to cancel the VPS I was renting. Steve and I were the only people who would be using it by that point, but I didn't need it and he kept telling me it didn't work anyway. So with a conscience whose cleanliness can only be the result of a faulty memory I cancelled that service.

24 hours later Steve tore into my office, frothing at the mouth. ""Remote access doesn't work anymore! It's totally broken!""

""Yeah, yeah, I know... You, me, laptop, et cetera.""

""No, it *did* work, but now it's totally broken and I can't do my work now!""

My ears immediately perked up and I did my best to project a halo of innocence round my head once I realized *why* it'd stopped working.  ""I'm quite certain you told me it didn't work at all...""

1563,Fun with phone lines,"So, yesterday's fun: I was in the office taking care of a few things (new switches for a remote office mostly) and I was asked to look at a phone line. Specifically the phone line used by the alarm system.

The alarm company says the line doesn't work and they can only connect over the LTE backup. This has been an ongoing issue.

I go in there with my butt set and check - yup there's dial tone, just like every other time I've checked it for them.

BUT - and this is a big but (but not as big as mine) - it's also on the main fax line. What?? Who are me Mom&amp;Pop Inc. with two lines? We have at least 4 1FLs that are just sitting unterminated on a BIX block in some random riser room.

So I go about figuring out how this line gets here (it's in the main electrical room - there's 50,000 volts behind me). I don't make it 18"" before I find a splice (it comes out of a multi-pair cable - maybe 6 pair?) then goes into another conduit. Trace the conduit - it comes out of there and is split into an old telecom screw terminal with a thousand other wires, most going nowhere, then out of that to another splice a foot away and into another conduit leading into the Bell room.

Into the Bell room I go, and find the conduit popping out right behind some massive metal box that the cable company managed to find an inconvenient place for. Trace the cable to another screw terminal where it goes down to an ancient jack on the wall, then back to the demarc via at least two BIX terminations.

So ok, I put my butt set on the BIX terminal that I REALLY need the line to work (ie: the thing that actually receives faxes) then listen as I disconnect the spliced-a-million-times cable from the nearest screw terminal. I still have dial tone, so I didn't break the FAX. Hooray!!!

I tried to pull the old cable out of the conduit so I could use it for a replacement cable, but it's very stuck. Oh well, it can just live there. I found a new path where I can run a simple four pair cable, terminate that on a properly labeled BIX block, put an unused line on it them terminate the other end directly at the alarm panel.

It works, but the alarm is still complaining. At least we know it's their problem now.

BTW: I think the reason for all the splices is that this is something like our third alarm/access control system. The old ones never seem to get entirely removed. There are several empty boxes on the walls with remnants of cables and abandoned-in-place hardware. So, every time we got a new system it the phone line was just spliced to the new box.

I guess next I should pull out all the rest of the dead gear, but who has the time?",1,1635948543

My friend brought me her laptop because her college IT had absolutely botched it. She'd taken it in with a rattling sound and no charge light. Campus IT asked her to purchase a new battery.

She got her laptop back in but they'd lost her charger and and used the wrong case screws, using two longer screws in the corner which poked through the case. And the worst part - they just showed her the laptop turning on, they didn't even test the charging indicator.

I used a multimeter to confirm the charger worked and opened up the case and found a loose screw that was causing the rattling. There was continuity between the charging port and the battery and anything else is above my pay grade.

She's said shes ""taking it back to IT because at this point she has nothing to lose""

TL;DR Campus IT loses charger, pokes new holes in case, unnecessarily asks for new battery and doesn't fix the original problem",1,1635904002

1574,It's in your Inbox," 

Waaaaay back in the late 90's I was the manager of a support and Help-Desk group. I'd come up through the ranks, so I was (and am) sensitive to the misery of supporting difficult people.

Even as far back as the time of this story, I hated fax machines. Every single tiny little organization in the company seemed able to demand that my group buy and maintain these stupid, fiddly things. As my hatred of them grew, I'd walk around and see them everywhere. It was a nightmare for me.

So, I worked with my boss and got approval for a skunk-works project to use fax capture cards and turn the incoming faxes into TIFF images and forward them as email attachments to the recipient. The project worked, and we scaled up the hardware until we had a box that had sixteen cards in it. We were able to eliminate all the fax machines in the company with this approach, and best of all each person in the company could have their own personal fax number. We could do this because we had a huge block of unused inbound DID numbers that terminated on our Centrex.

After approximately nine hundred million emails to the entire company and several training sessions (that mostly consisted of 'open your email from INBOUND-FAX-xxxx' and you will see your inbound fax' repeated over and over again), we cut over to the new system. People got new business cards hand delivered to their desks, and all was well.

Except for terribly-minor-executive-X in legal (TMEX). This person was apparently having a really, really difficult issue with the new system. He called into the help desk and informed them that he was unable to receive faxes, and that since he was an incredibly important person, he would simply continue to use the old mechanical machine. This was fine, and this situation lasted about a *year*.

After a year or so, the maintenance contract on the old fax machine expired and my boss told me not to renew it. So, we sent an email to TMEX informing him that the old machine would be retired, and that since **\*hundreds\*** of people had been successfully using the new system, we expected that whatever issue he had would no longer be an issue. And so, we disconnected the machine and rolled it away. Everywhere I looked, no fax machines. It was good!

Immediately on Monday we get a call from TMEX.

TMEX ""I have missed hundreds of pages of faxes!""

Help Desk Person ""They're on the log. Let me check something. ""

HDP: ""Yes, they were delivered to your inbox""

TMEX ""No, they weren't""

HDP: ""Oh, let me escalate""

TMEX: ""This entire system is sh\*t, you are sh\*t, and your team is sh\*t! Nothing works!""

So the poor person on help desk escalated the situation to me, and I looked into it. Yes indeed, all the faxes had been delivered to his email and were sitting there unread. So I went over to see this super friendly and kind person.

Me: ""Hello TMEX, it's me from the help desk team, what's the problem?""

He immediately begins cursing at me and blaming me for everything.

*HE THEN POINTS TO HIS PHYSICAL MAIL ORGANIZER WITH A SLOT ON IT LABELED* ***""INBOX""*** and he yells at me. ""See???? There's nothing in my inbox!!! I've missed hundreds of super, insanely, ridiculously important faxes upon which the entire fate of civilization as we know it depend, you massive idiot!!!"" (only a slight exaggeration)

So, I ask him to open his email. This insanely brilliant person has created a spam filter and put our fax system in it.

TMEX: ""I was getting too many emails! You cannot possibly expect me to look at so many emails!""

So I make him a fax folder on his email client.

TMEX: ""But it's NOT in my inbox!""

....

The solution was to have one of the poor, hapless admins get his faxes, print them out, and then physically place them in his 'inbox'.

1576,Watching a human buffer,"I work as a student assistant at a University, where I attend the third and last year of Computer Engineering. I work as a helper in the second year Networking class, helping students to follow labs and set up services like simple web/mail servers.

The students throughout the semester are to complete a set of labs that prepare them for two projects. One small project to prepare them for their second, and more extensive project, which is their exam. The labs consists of a walk-through part first, making the students set up the given service that the lab entails, followed up by questions. These questions would be anything from ""Describe how this works"", to change the configuration of what you have just set up to achieve ""THIS"" result. As the labs gets more advanced one could still follow them to a tee, to complete the initial setup, but the questions would eventually get more to the point of having to google, how to do certain things.

As these are second year students one would expect at least a rather basic IT comprehension at this point, and they should be familiar with basic Linux commands and terminal usage.

Some students in their year obviously aren't where their progression in their degree suggests. I have been a helper in other/previous classes too; like intro to Linux, and object oriented programming, so I know to a certain degree which are the stronger and weaker students of the bunch. Of the lesser end of the bunch are a few that stand a bit out... like this one.

(The lab environment is in CentOS 7, which uses systemd, so the accompanying commands are used)

&amp;#x200B;

M = me &amp; ST = student

&amp;#x200B;

ST had a habit of sitting at the lab computer and waiting until I made eye contact, where they would then raise their hand to ask a question. They would only try a command once, and then figure they are either stuck, or progress the lab not caring about the fact that a service isn't running, and then getting more stuck later.

Meanwhile sitting and staring at their screen, they would not make any effort to reading the lab instructions again or googling the errors that might be appearing.

I would always find this a bit fascinating as the first interaction between us, every single time I got up to ST would be something along the lines of:

&amp;#x200B;

M: ""What seems to be the problem?""

As I look at the terminal window to see if I can immediately identify the problem

&amp;#x200B;

ST: ""Well I changed this\* in the config file, and tried the restart command, and it won't start""

\*Points to the lab instructions, where one could input exactly what it says into the config file, and the service would work.

&amp;#x200B;

M: ""Okay, have you looked at the status, which it says right there\*?""

\*Points to the terminal output telling the user what troubleshooting steps they could do on their own.

This is where the now famous, among the student assistants, ""Buffer"" comes along.

&amp;#x200B;

Any time me or the other helper would get to this stage of the conversation, it would be like watching literal gears grinding in their head as they were trying to kick-start their thought process, to figure out what to do next.

The answer would always be ""No, I haven't looked at that"" - ""No, I haven't googled that"" -  ""No, I haven't tried to follow the labs instructions again""

But before every single one of these types of responses I would, in awe, watch as this person spent a total of 5 to 10 seconds sit in complete silence, trying to figure out what to do with the words that just came hurdling in their direction.

&amp;#x200B;

Often times the questions ST had would be of the kind that could be solved by going back into the config file and double checking syntax, or seeing what systemd would output to logs. But time and time again ST would insist on sitting in silence, until making eye contact.. for me to then have to watch as my request for a command or a google search churned away in their head, and them figuring out or being told, their simple mistake.

Yet every single time ST got stuck, I would have to walk over to them. Ask them if they googled it, or ran the command that is currently being displayed in their terminal.. only to watch them sit for an eventual alarming amount of time in silence, processing what I had just said.

It could be something as simple as:

&amp;#x200B;

M: ""Now, please write 'journalctl -xn' and let's see what the output is""

&amp;#x200B;

\*Proceeds to wait 5 seconds for them to process\*

&amp;#x200B;

ST: ""What command to you mean?""

&amp;#x200B;

M: ""The one that is being displayed right there, that we have used before to check what's wrong""

Getting a bit frustrated at this point as we are several labs in and has used the same command multiple times before, even a couple today already.

&amp;#x200B;

ST: Wait for another 5-10 seconds and then proceeds to type in the command.

&amp;#x200B;

M: ""Okay, we can see there is an error in that file.. so could you please cat that for me?""

&amp;#x200B;

\* .... \[for about 5-10 seconds\]\*

&amp;#x200B;

ST: ""What do you mean cat, what file?""

&amp;#x200B;

M:  ""The cat command, we have used several times before to check the contents of a specific file..""

""I'm talking about the file being marked as having errors in the logs we are currently looking at"" \*Points to the file being marked with errors\*



\* .... \* (You know the drill at this point)

&amp;#x200B;

ST: Writes the command, sees the content of the file.

At which point I would either point out a syntax error, or I would let them figure it out on their own, and come back later when they inevitably haven't done anything to figure out their own mistake.

&amp;#x200B;

This would be and currently still is with their projects being worked on, be a reoccurring segment of my day. This has of course only gotten worse as the projects doesn't have any instructions only a requirement for what needs to be set up, but it is completely based on everything the students should have learned in their labs already. Technically one could follow the walk-through of each lab, replacing the contents of config files with the requirements of the projects.. and be all set up... but this is not something that is easily understood by ST

&amp;#x200B;

At times I have theorized that ST is actually a Humanoid Android, that is built to learn about technology like a human.. only the processing unit the creators used is vastly under-performing for the use case.

&amp;#x200B;

Whenever I help ST still to this day I can't help but being a bit fascinated, and also get my tinfoil hat out.

This goes back a fair few years now (and quite possibly some of the other guys I worked with are on here and will remember this).

Anyway, I used to work support for a hotel management system.  Pretty complete system, making and tracking bookings etc. But it also hooked into a LOT of third party systems, such as point of sale, telephone call logging (automatic charging of calls from hotel rooms to customer bills), accounting software.. You get the idea...
We had one customer, a small group of hotels dotted around the country (UK - I'm being purposefully vague), who had their own internal IT support for general computer/phone issues, and they only were supposed to call us specifically for issues relating to our software.  Part of our job included a rota system where we were on call 24 hours a day, so could get woken up at any point in night. 

So onto the actual event... Their IT either updated or replaced the phones in all bedrooms. Part of this included adding speed dial (you know, ""dial 0 for reception), except (and to this day I can't see how they screwed this up so bad), on ONE phone in ONE bedroom of ONE hotel, they repurposed an old reception phone, and didn't think to check the speed dial, which someone had set to our help desk.
Cue the months of sporadic calls at any time between midnight and 2am from random businessmen asking for 5am (or some other time) wake up calls...

When your woken up at 2am for a ""non emergency"", all you want to do is get them off the phone and go back to sleep, so it was always a quick ""you need to dial reception, this is a support line"" and hang up. It took their IT probably a year or more to find and resolve this issue for us
(I'm pretty sure at one point we asked one of the guys that 'called' us what room he was in so the hotel groups IT didn't even have to find the phone... They were just not that bothered by it).

I'll always remember the day I came off the ""out of hours"" rota... That was a good feeling!!!

We've got two hosted environments for QuickBooks. I can't install midday without stopping folks' work, so I move got everyone out of Host A and blocked new logins, and updated Host A. Once that was done I opened Host A back online, and blocked Host B off to new logins. This way, I minimize the impact on the staff, and have an easy resolution for the people who need the updated versions of QuickBooks.

I sent out an email, and a Teams notification, telling everyone what happened. If they don't need QuickBooks, they're fine where they are. If they need QuickBooks and they get the update notification, that means they're in Host B. All they have to do is log out, and when they log back in, they will get forced into Host A, where everything's updated. I tell them all that Host B will be updated this weekend, as per our normal schedule. 

I didn't check my emails until this evening, and what do you know, half a dozen people whining about the QuickBooks notification.

This week, Tuesday: Customer puts in a support case with us to push over all the data to the third party. They want it done after hours. I set up a call with the customer to scope out the work.

1598,"How to fix our low email deliverability rate? Should we use help, or is there a way to do it ourselves?","Hi everybody!

&amp;#x200B;

My question might seem a little bit silly, but since there are no stupid questions, I would like to take my opportunity and ask it. What are the real reasons for the low email deliverability rate?

&amp;#x200B;

The issue is that our company has recently faced some problems with email deliverability. Some of our clients, for some reason, can't see our emails in their inbox, only in spam or promotion. We've checked our deliverability score, and the results were disappointing. I'm even embarrassed to say how low our ratio was. We obviously, contacted tech support and asked for assistance. They did some tests and assured us that everything was fine. They said that our emails ended up in the spam folder because of the recipient's filters and settings. Sounds reasonable, but not in the case when 8 out of 10 emails end up in the spam folder.

&amp;#x200B;

We decided to get to it ourselves, and so far, we have improved some things without third-parties assistance. Here are the steps we took:

&amp;#x200B;

We warmed up the IP address by gradually increasing the number of emails sent to build a good sender reputation. — It helped us improve our deliverability, and we started sending all emails in small portions.

&amp;#x200B;

Implemented double opt-in and asked subscribers to add our ""Sender Address"" to their contact list. - This also helped us to get a couple of points in our deliverability score.

&amp;#x200B;

We read that a clean mailing list without obsolete or non-existent addresses positively affects the deliverability rate. - We had to do a massive cleaning of contacts in mailing lists, which was also helpful.

&amp;#x200B;

So, overall, we did improve our deliverability. Still, the total rate is not that impressive as we aimed for. In the meantime, we found this service — [http://folderly.com/](http://folderly.com/) that detects issues harming deliverability and fixes them. Do you think it is worth using this or similar services, or can we continue fixing everything on our own? If so, what can be done to improve our rate. Any tips and suggestions are very welcome. Thanks in advance, guys!",1,1635517582
1599,The PC was stolen!,"For context, this happened in my first few months as an IT guy for my current job at a health care provider. I was pretty new and really only knew the basics of IT; I only got the gig because they were desperate (whole team had turned over save for the boss and one tech). 

For the most part this place used 95% full sized Dell Optiplexes. They had a handful of micro formfactors but they were few and far between and generally reserved for admininstration. I get a call for help from a team room where all of our nurses work and when I get there the one nurse is absolutely frantic. 

""Someone stole our PC!""

I take this proclamation with a grain of salt and take a look at the workstation. Monitor is powered on but the screen is black. I look beneath the desk and see.... there's no desktop. All 11 other workstations in this room had those large Optiplexes underneath the desk and this one had nada. Oh shoot... Someone did steal their PC!

I call up the boss and say hey, what do we do? There's no PC here, I think it may have been stolen! He tells me to sit tight and comes on down.

Boss gets down to the room within ten minutes and does the same examination I do and comes to the same conclusion, this PC was jacked right from under our noses! He starts talking to the other nurses about who has been in the room recently, starts making calls to security to get logs, writes an email up  to finance to purchase a replacement...

...then another nurse walks up to us and asks, ""Did you check behind the monitor?""

Sure enough, mounted right behind the monitor is a tiny little MFF Optiplex that was powered off. I hit the power button and let the original nurse get back to work.

Needless to say, both ""IT professionals"" involved felt a little embarrassed.",1,1635514115

1604,The guy who experiments while learning,"Definitely before my IT days, I was doing a theatre course and I helped in the office (Windows 3.1 days).  We only had one PC, no backups except a few files on Floppies - hey, we were all young and dumb once.  But the PC was shared. 

Cast:  
Me: Aspiring Actor (still do amateur dramatics) and already the guy to call about the PC  
Napalm: A friend (and somehow he remained a friend) that for apparent reasons we shall call Napalm  
The Mac: Course tutor, good with Amega computers (used in sound industry programs back then but not skilled with PCs)

One day, having to do something (25+ years ago, no idea what) I arrived at the PC.  To find the vast majority of the files missing.  Now, in truth we had been running low on disk space so had managed to updrade from DOS 5 to DOS 6.22 which had Doublespace (or was it Drivespace?) to get some more space that we needed.  But before using it, I wanted to read a bit about it first as I didn't know what to do.  Napalm did not share my cautious approach and had doublespaced the drive - successfully.  But the disk had already been partitioned into two.  He managed to delete all the files on the second partition (permanently - no internet to download software and no cash either), leave the space wasted without a partition and just doublespaced the rest.  This is how I found the PC when I arrived.

I called him over for a quick word...

Now, at the time that this happened, I did not know him well.  And I was not a prope tech person yet, having not known until later that day that hard disks could be partitioned (we all learn one day).  I thought that he may have taken the D:\\, at the time having assumed that it was a second physical drive.  Also, Napalm (who was an expert at destroying a wide range of things - he once helped construct a set that none of the actors was willing to stand on) had tools at the theatre to open the case which I did not.  So, with me observing (his tools) took the cover off the tower.  Nothing apparant and the dust make it clear no second drive had been taken so we went to put it together again.  

Somehow - *somehow*, Napalm found a live wire to earth itself against the case, blowing power to the theatre.  And wiping the music that The Mac had been doing at his amega in the other office.  The Mac came into our office, somewhat vexed, to find Napalm repeating endlessly ""I don't know what happened, it's not my fault"" and me in the corner with a fit of histerical laughter having really understood '*the napalm effect'* for the first time.

Never did get the files back but thankfully the theatre had a qualified electrician to hide the live wire that, to this day, I don't know where Napalm found.",1,1635507844

Call comes in during business hours, he's a squeaky wheel, won't accept terms of warranty and so forth so he ends up with me. I am normally a guy who kills with kindness but this bloke really wound up all the staff before me. Reproduction of the convo, so apologies its not verbatim.
Client will be ''Client'' because I fucking hate the dollar sign garbage on this thread it makes me want to throw up. Sorry.
I will be ''me'' because I am me.

Client: I want a full replacement of my laptop, I've had five discussions, five. I have a full replacement warranty and I am familiar with the dimensions of the contract.

Me: I understand your needs, however the contract states certain preclusion's upon which we cannot service or replace your laptop.

Client: This is not good enough I'm sick of this! IT IS WATER DAMAGE!!!!

Me: Yes I have the insurance claim you submitted, it shows you lost the device whilst onboard a yacht on open waters, well, I think open waters if that is correct sir?

Client: YES. I WAS USING IT AND IT SLID OFF MY LAP I CAUGHT IT AS IT FELL I STILL HAVE IT THEREFORE IT IS WATER DAMAGE.

His voice was almost but not quite at crescendo, I waited a moment and replied..

So you took a laptop onto a boat, on open water on an ocean or lake, and lost control of it. Any water damage you experienced was as a result of you and your actions in using the device outside the specific parameters of the warranty that you had advised you were familiar with.

Boats, sir, are not normal operating environments for a laptop.

Client: BUT IM AN ENGINEER! (he then hung up)

Where does the Woody part come in?
At the time this call became legend, in the call centre, I had a tiny slightly adjustable figurine of Woody from Toy Story, which was my sons and as a toddler he ''gave'' to me so it sat on my desk.

Any time someone would have an issue that was insurmountable and through talk I detected it was headed for my desk I would say capping off a sentence in an thoroughly English accent ''furthermore, ...............I.........have a Woody'' (then produce the Woody toy).

So, by mutation, in the call centre, the staff would say privately in between calls about arsehole callers...''but im an engineer and I HAVE A WOODY''.

The first call comes from someone at a health services clinic we service who is unable to get into their EMR account. I go through my usual spiel of greeting and grabbing this persons info. So from the get go, she is unable to sign into her EMR account as mentioned earlier. I go in and reset her password, because we have the option that we can set it to what they want, they spell out and when I verify spelling, she corrects it saying a letter I’ve never in my life heard, (pronounced ara) I’m like you mean r? She’s like “nooooo, it’s ara…. I’m like ok then… so I go and just give her a temp password, she then tells me “I’m in the system, i don’t need my password reset. I respond, “so are you able to get in but just can’t see the charts?” She responds “no I can’t get into the EMR!” But more than likely you’re locked out. She again responds “No I’m in the system.” 

I’m already confused as it is. So I ask her to go to a website to do a remote session to see what’s going, I tell her to open Chrome and type in the web address in the search bar… Simple enough. Right? Right?….. Wrong! We wasted 15 minutes trying to a do a remote session and the person acted like she was taking the SAT’s…. And we’ve been busy on the phones for our tech support lines so I had to dump this off to the on-site tech to further assist since she had no idea where to go or how to search a website….

1611,Smartest guy in the room? Maybe not.,"Another story involving $bigboss, but this introduces a new character, who we'll call supertech, or $st for the sake of brevity.  We'll all use $bb for bigboss.

$st had been hired to help our support group plus do some web and database work for a professor's research project.  $st was pretty smart, but didn't have the best people skills, basically he let everyone know that he was the smartest person in the room and everyone should follow his lead.  Of course this got old pretty fast, but he did have some good ideas.  My largest issue with $st was his desire to make our entire infrastructure over into something he was more familiar with, rather than him have to learn our existing systems, which were actually pretty cool.

One thing we had that $st was not familiar with was a fancy file server.  He was eager to learn about it and I spent some time showing him the various features, how to create volumes, set permissions, create and change exports, and resize volumes, which could be done on the fly.  He got pretty interested in all the cool things that could be done and went off to explore on his own.  

This server supported our entire mail spool environment, along with various user home directories and special research volumes, so it was more or less the lynch pin of our infrastructure, right up there with our network switches, very little worked without it, but it was extremely robust.

One day $st went by my office and said he was going to lunch, which really meant to the gym, and he would be gone for 90 minutes or so.  No problem, I was having lunch at my desk that day.    After a while I got a phone call from our administrative person in the front office, $bigboss was having problems with email, I needed to look into it ASAP.  

I checked my email and could see old messages, but nothing new was coming in.  I logged into the mail server and could see it was rejecting all new messages, basically ""no space on device"" situation.  I was concerned that something had happened to the file server, but access to other volumes was fine, then I saw that the ""mail"" volume was 100% full.  This was weird, had never happened before, but I thought about for a second and realized the size of the volume looked smaller than I remembered.   I resized it (again this could be done on the fly, pretty cool for the early 2000s), and once I did this I could see mail now flowing normally.  I watched it for a while, then headed off to $bb's office to make sure he was ok.

When I got there, $st and $bb were in front of $bb's desktop, muttering about email.  I had figured out that $st had almost certainly resized the volume ""to save space"".   I asked if email was ok, and $bb told me that the problem had magically vanished, and did I know what happened.  I simply said our mail volume had filled up, but I had enlarged it enough to avoid having it happen again.  

$st, realizing what he had done was staring at me, wondering if I was going to rat him out, but I had to work with him, and anyone can make a mistake.  $bb just said thanks, and he hoped we'd keep an eye on stuff like this in the future.  $st and I assured him we would and walked together back to our office.  $st was pretty quiet on the way back, it one of those ""I know what you did, and you know, that I know what you did"" situations.  He was pretty embarrassed, but I figured he had learned his lesson on messing around with stuff you don't understand, especially when you are about to walk out of the office for a couple of hours, and you don't tell anyone what you did.",1,1635457422

1615,Call in the big guns,"A long time ago, I worked at company that provided a service for other businesses that involved storing very large quantities of video data. From camera to server. For various reasons video records were required to be held for many years. So the data was archived to blue ray disk several times a day to make sure the servers didn't get overloaded.

One of our biggest clients was suddenly unable to back up their data on any of their machines. This was a big problem because due to the sheer volume of video they recorded even their substantial server would get completely full in within a couple weeks if it couldn't be archived.

I was a front line tech for this process at the time, but it was quickly escalated well over my head after basic troubleshooting. Making sure the blu rays were right side up, checking the archive settings to make sure nothing had been inadvertently switched off, testing the connection between the archive machine and the server, etc. Big programming and engineer brains were combing over the set up before end of day, trying to figure out what had caused this seemingly spontaneous error.

Before long it was going to come to a point where the entire system was unusable. The lead developer, a guy who had been at the company for decades and had been integral to the programming of all the products we currently had on the market, flew across the country to get physically in front of the server for potential offline reimagining, manual backups, or whatever other wizardry was needed to unproblem this.

He flew across the country, went straight from the airport to the archive machinery, opened the case to check the machinery of the archive machine, and said, ""These are cds."" And they were.

1616,A networking cabinet tries to assassinate a co-worker,"We've managed to make networking exciting for at least ten people!

I help teach a course for computer security and basic networking on a military base, it's a week long course that includes an introduction to networking (think network layers, DNS, IPV4/6 etc). 

We take over a classroom that has a bunch of trunking with power/network, which leads over to a small classroom with a big 48U cabinet patch panel (for the  classroom and another room). Naturally we use it as a good demonstration for a physical network (and also so we don't have to run our own infrastructure for the internal network). 

&amp;#x200B;

My colleague decides to show the course students the patch panel, and opens the tempered glass door of the cabinet. 

This is where things get a lot more.... explosive

As he's talking to the students and standing in front of the cabinet, the glass door spontaneously and instantly turns into thousands of small chunks of glass. The door quite literally just blew up with an enormous BANG and peppered the students and my colleague with tiny shards of glass, almost as if a hand grenade went off.

The force of the shattering was significant enough to project the glass chunks out of the open door of the room, into and down the corridor. 

As you could imagine the language used at that moment was less than polite! Fortunately he threw himself in front of the students to shield them from the glass, and **Un**fortunately got a few cuts and scrapes from the projectile. 

One student got a tiny cut on their neck, whilst my colleague continued to talk bleeding everywhere, I'd say that's proper commitment to the lesson.

&amp;#x200B;

It turned out his uniform boots had suffered a long gash from the force of the shrapnel, and his laces had been sliced by a stray chunk. The boots now glint in the sunlight (We've now called that pair the ""Fabulous Footwear""). 

We also joke that someone must have tried to assassinate him via networking equipment and failed. 

The running theory is that the glass must have been under some form of stress, and the movement of opening the door must have started tiny cracks, which just expanded and shattered it, sending tempered glass in all directions! 

We swept it up, replaced the door with a metal one, and mulled over the freak accident. Building management chalked it up as something that really wasn't anyone's fault. After a shower and change of uniform, the guy was back to teaching in the afternoon.

**Introduction**

I'm doing some on-site project management for one client. Standard equipment and network refresh stuff being handled by another contractor. My job is to keep them on time and on task. I don't get the ins-and-outs of why two contractors to do the job, but they are paying me an inflated hourly rate so none of my business. The contract specs are crystal clear. The other company handles all the technical stuff and I manage the timeline. In fact, there is a clause that I'm not even supposed to touch the equipment. Maybe it is security, maybe it is some government funding BS, maybe someone's brother is making a ton of cash on a weird deal, doesn't really matter to me. But, those are the terms, don't touch the stuff.

**""The Network is Down!""**

I'm at my desk looking at the timeline, checking on some deliveries, and about ready to hop on a status update meeting. The job is going well. Despite the supply chain, we are still getting deliveries more or less on time. I've got to move around a few things, but looks like we are going to finish on time and under budget. That is as long as the clowns the other contractor have don't f- it up.

The first set of guys were fine. They were seasoned system admins who came in and did all the backroom stuff over a long weekend. Looked good and their supervisor gave me a full briefing. But, for some reason, maybe the market or just saving a few bucks, they fielded the bomb squad of techs to deploy workstations. I mean these guys were so dumb there was no way they could ever figure out they were dumb kind of stupid.

They literally had flip books of every step to follow including how to take the machine out of the box and where to stage the mouse and keyboard. I've never seen anything like this although, but whatever it isn't rocket science getting these things up and running. They seem to be doing an adequate job meeting the goal and the end of the day.

That is until one guy screams, ""the internet is broken!""

**Outage Outrage**

It is the middle of the workday and this company is going full tilt with sales. The location is almost fully staffed and of course one of the big sales guys has a 5pm deadline to get something to a client. After a few minutes of confusion, one of the company leads comes into the conference room where I have set up shop and asks me if I can take a look. They can't find their internal guy anywhere.

Now I am generally pretty helpful even if it isn't in my scope of work, but here I'm a bit hesitant. The contract said I'm not to touch the equipment. I'm there for project management only. So, I tell the lead that I'm not comfortable unless he can give me something in writing.

IT Guy: ""Look the contract is pretty specific here...""

Lead: ""Is there anything you can do. We have a call in for our guy but no one knows where he is and these other contractors have no idea what is going on....""

IT Guy: ""If you can give me something in writing....""

Lead: (frustrated) ""All the brass are off site today and I'm in charge, but I don't have much authority. There is going to be a revolt in about 15 minutes unless we do something now. I'll write you an email or something as long as you can just maybe take a look. Don't do anything, but just see if you can get a handle on what we need to do...""

OK....good enough for me. Send me that email.

**Well That Was Easy**

I start by taking a look in the backroom. Switches and firewall all look stable. Servers are all running. But, then I notice a few of the switches have a ton of activity. Like flashing more then the Christmas Tree in the town square kind of action going on. Hmm....that is weird.

I ask the Lead to take me to where drop 47 is because that switch is acting particularly strange from just the optics of it. He starts looking around at the plates and gets a some lady to help him. But whoever did the wiring job actually kept the drops sequential order (nice job guy whoever, wherever you are) which made it easier to track down.

This takes us to an area where these contractors are staging the new equipment. Gomer and his pals are just sitting around playing on their phones presumably because they can't complete their current staging job until the network is back up.

I ask the one guy to show me how they have the staging area wired and he points over to a mess of cables, routers, hubs, and other network equipment. I start tracing back all the various cables and find one router jacked into two sequential drops. Well that is the issue right there - simple broadcast storm.

IT Guy: ""Hey why did you do that?""

Gomer: ""The internet was slow so we plugged it in again to make it go faster.""

Ugh. These idiots brought down an entire network for almost an hour because they lack basic tech skills.

I tell the lead what needs to be done and once we clear the loop and power cycle the affected switches everything is back up and running. Just in time for their in-house IT team to come busting through the main door....

**Back to Work**

I go back to the conference room where I have my ad hoc office and complete whatever I was doing for that day. At 5 the Lead comes in and thanks me profusely. Apparently whatever the deal was with the deadline was a huge deal and they were just able to transmit all the files right before a contractual deadline that if it was missed out have cost them a huge chunk of revenue.

Of course no good deed goes unpunished. Apparently one of the in-house guys caught wind that I helped troubleshoot the problem and made a fuss (don't know why or his motivation). Glad I had the email and the Lead, to his credit, had my back when Legal came to investigate. It was a mild pain, but the Lead has given me multiple good reference since so maybe it was worth it.

About a week after the job concluded I got an unexpected knock at my door. It was a delivery driver with a nice gift basket. Surprised, I looked for a note. Turns out it was from the Lead and the note had  a simple inscription ""Thanks IT Guy!""",1,1635411887

A man calls the notebook support, and when a woman answers the phone, he demands to be transfered to a technician.

After going back and forth a couple of times, she offered to transfer him to the Level 2 tech, which he accepted. When I answered, I could almost smell the smoke coming out of his ears because he was once again talking to a woman.  
He refused to state why he was calling, and kept saying he wanted to speak to a real technician. And if he couldn't speak to a technician he wanted to talk to my manager.

I work for an MSP. All our clients are small and medium business, plus the presidents OG clients from when he started the company. 

At the time I was a T1 and while I didn't take the call, I heard it being taken by another T1 coworker. 

User calls, needs help with something browser related. Is asked the standard question ""and what company are you calling from?"" and answers. Coworker becomes progressively more confused as she can't find any information about the company. They're not even in the offboarded database. Coworker asks if the company ever changed names, gets a negative. 

My coworker starts to think that maybe the user had just searched for a tech support company in our area and called a random one, and after asking the user it's revealed to be exactly what happened. She explains the mixup to the user (that we only support businesses) but bless her, still helps the user troubleshoot and fix her problem. (I think it had to do with Chrome settings)

User didn't get angry, or beligerant. I honestly wish half our clients acted as well as a complete rando who found us on Google.

Bonus: The customer is usually wrong, but sometimes the tech is also an idiot.

My job at the above-mentioned MSP is my first and current tech support job. I've moved to bench, but for my first 4 months I was T1 phone support. There has been at least one time I can currently remember that I was certainly an idiot on the phone. There are probably more, and at least one that I'm still too embarrassed about to share.

I was dealing with user on RDS having issues with the USB printer pass-through. Most likely beyond me at the time, so I needed to gather info and bump. Whoops, need to get computer name to remote in as login is shared and generic. No issue. Ask if users knows the name. Nope. That's fine! I know several ways to guide the user though getting the name. I start trying them. User is confused, doesn't see what I'm telling her to see, can't find the name. I start just assuming this woman is an idiot. Nothing is working. I've reached my time limit.

Turns out the RDS server is running a few windows 7 clients for compatability with some weird clunky medical shit. I never thought to ask, she never though to tell. No wonder my instructions to find the computer name weren't working.",1,1635385015

1627,not enough spam? another $bigboss incident,"I've mentioned $bigboss in a previous post or two, here's another one.  Its mostly an example of how managers can waste people's time.

We ran a fairly basic mail server, with anti spam blacklist and DNS blacklist, so not totally ""Wild West"", but not like a fancy corporate or outsourced solution for sure.    

Anyway, our story starts with me working hard, probably reading slashdot or something similar.  I get an email from $bigboss, he's concerned that there is something wrong with our email.   He isn't getting as many messages as he would expect to, not even getting as much spam as he's used to.

I'm kind of raising an eyebrows at this, not many folks complain about NOT getting spam.  Anyway I follow up with him to see if he has any examples of messages he EXPECTED to get, but did not.   Has someone told him that they sent him something but he did not receive it?   No, its just a feeling.  He's sure he isn't getting as many emails as normal, please can I check it out.

We did track email on a very macro level, total messages in and out, graphed hourly, spam messages, fairly basic stuff, nothing at the user level.  So, to the mail logs I go.   I spent about an hour going back through the logs, grepping for messages to $bigboss, sorting and counting them day to day for the previous week.   Of course what I found is the number of messages varied enough each day that I couldn't really tell if he was missing any or not.  And all the time I'm rolling my eyes over the time wasting because $bigboss has a ""feeling"".  No other user is raising this issue, I'm certainly not seeing it myself.

After my sorting/counting/comparing project produces no real results (not that I expected it to), I email him that I've checked, don't see anything wrong, our mail volume is about what it normally is, certainly not markedly different than the day before, but I'll keep an eye on it ""just in case"".  He emails back a thank you, and that's the end of it.

Our team of two (2) is responsible for support for more than 1500 user in 12 different offices in the midwest region of the US.

A woman (who is approaching 70) from one of the remote offices calls in because she could no longer use her external monitors, KB or mouse.  She was also not able to remove her PC from the dock or it would power off immediately.  I informed her she would need to ship the laptop to our office so I could get it repaired.  She had broken the USBC port on her laptop as others could use her same dock and everything worked.

She was sent a loaner laptop and we were walking her through getting logged into it, and it required her to plug the ethernet cable into the laptop so her profile could be built.  This is where the problem came in - it wasnt getting a LAN connection.

I told her to plug an ethernet cable into the wall, and asked her to verify she was getting link lights where the ethernet cable (or as she called it, the big phone cable) plugged into the laptop.  I also let her know she needed to push it in hard to hear and feel the click.

1632,Sorry For Fixing Their Problems,"This is a story about a time I literally saved a hospitals network and got in trouble for doing it.  I will do my absolute best not to embellish facts but bear in mind this was a bit ago and exact dialog has been lost to my not-so-great memory.  Also i'm terrible at formatting on reddit, sorry if this looks terrible.  Also sorry for the length, this is going to be a long story.

Backstory:

Late 2019 I started my networking career in my first big-boy networking job as a L2 network engineer.  I worked for a medium-sized tech company in a different department prior to this new position, but after expressing my interest and lots of personal training I managed to land a job in their tiny networking department.  I was ecstatic; networking was exactly what I wanted to do and this was my foot in the door.  The pay was absolutely abysmal and management was overbearing, but it'll look great on the resume.  At this point I was nearing a decade at this company and had received numerous awards for multiple different things; I was well known and well liked, getting the job was a piece of cake once I was ready.  

One thing worth mentioning is that this tech company had offices all over the continent, one of which was in my city.  This wasn't the headquarters mind you, but just a satellite office for service desk.  I worked from home for many years without issue, but after a while I started to get cabin fever and asked if I could, at my own discretion, pop into the office occasionally to get out of the house.  This was approved and I setup a desk at the office for whenever I felt like stretching my feet.

Then I got this networking position.  There were no networking coworkers in my office, just little old me.  My boss was in another city far away.  You might be thinking ""Katha, that must mean you can continue your WFH arrangement right? You're not missing anything at the office"".  Nope, my direct boss had to drive an hour to his office because he was part of management, and if he had to suffer so did I.  I had to drive to the office.....just because.  Although this didn't sit well with me, it was what it was. This just shows what kind of mindset management had.

Fast forward to mid 2020; COVID is in full swing and hospitals are starting to struggle.  A couple of months prior we had signed up a tiny hospital in a rural town about an hour away.  One of the services we offered was network monitoring and remediation, and because I was the only network engineer within 500 miles, it was my responsibility to do....stuff.  They were extremely vague about what I would be asked to do and what we could dispatch a field tech to do, whatever gave them more control over me.

Story:

Cast: $Me, $SC (site contact), $B (Boss), $BB (Bosses Boss)
3:00PM.  I was starting to relax as the day was just about over, thoughts dancing in my head about what i'm going to do after work (spoiler alert: nap).  Then we received a P1 alert:  The domain controller at the hospital went offline.  More P1s started rolling in, core switch stack went offline and took everything else with it.  We received dozens of P1s for every device and immediately a P1 bridge was spun up.  Recognizing this was more than likely a network failure and representing the network department, I jump on the bridge.

$B and I jump on and we start our inspection to determine the scope of the outage.  Nothing on the inside of the firewall is responding, period.  Looking over our documentation and diagrams its evident the core switch had some sort of failure but we weren't sure how bad this was.  We got $SC on the line and verified the server room had power and the devices were powered.  Everything checked out, and it was decided I needed to go onsite. I pack up my tools, jump in the truck and drive the hour out there.  By this point it's 4PM.

5PM I roll into the parking lot and walk inside.  I make my way to the server room and meet with $SC.  I do a quick inspection of the equipment and everything is lit, but one thing I noticed immediately is every single port that was enabled is flashing concurrently and consistently.  Red flag.  I setup my laptop and call into the bridge and let them know i'm onsite.  Let the troubleshooting begin!  While $B and $BB are talking about potential issues and trying their best to think of troubleshooting steps, i'm already working.

First thing I check is the firewall downlink, checked out.  I plug the switch back into the firewall and patch my laptop directly into the switch.  When I pinged the switch management IP it was dropping half the pings and the time was all over the place, a couple of ms up to several seconds each.  This didn't make sense, and mentioned my findings to the people on the bridge.  

My boss goes quiet for a couple of seconds.

$B ""Are you working off to the side?""  

$Me ""Um...yes?  They need to get working right? Shouldn't I be troubleshooting? Isn't that why i'm here?""

$B ""No, you're there as an extension of us, we need you to follow our exact instructions.  Do not do anything on your own without us knowing about it first.""

I should mention that my cellphone was on speaker so I could use both of my hands to type commands.  $SC, the technical director for the hospital, was sitting next to me helping me troubleshoot.  He wanted this thing fixed and fixed NOW.  He was a very patient and nice person, but there was a lot of pressure to get this working and he was happy up until this point with what I was doing.  When he heard my boss say that, he lost his shit.  I put my phone on mute. 

$SC ""Did they just say they don't want you to do anything?""

$Me ""Sorry you had to hear that, I have no idea what the issue is but i'm very confused why they don't want me troubleshooting this""

$SC ""That is completely unacceptable, how the hell are you supposed to help get this working if you aren't allowed to do anything? Why are you even here then?""  

$Me ""Your guess is as good as mine.""

$SC ""I don't care what they say.  Let's keep going, fuck them.""

Eventually they started giving me troubleshooting commands (notably, commands I already ran) and with the info I provided back they determined the first switch in the core was faulty and needed to be replaced.  Oh yeah, I forgot to mention that this switch ""stack"" wasn't actually stacked, it was daisy chained switch 1 -&gt; 2, 2 -&gt; 3.  

$B (to $SC) ""Unfortunately it looks like the first switch is malfunctioning and not passing traffic properly.  It will need to be replaced, we'll go ahead and check on the warranty info and see if we can get one overnighted""

At this point this did not jive with what I was witnessing, but I had a hunch of what it could be.  I hadn't witnessed one of these in the wild yet, but it might be...

$Me (to the people on the bridge) ""Hey guys, I need to put you on hold for a second.""  I muted my mic and talked directly to $SC.

$Me ""Look, i've got a sneaking suspicion that the switch is fine but there could be something else going on called a broadcast storm.  There is a really easy way to determine whether this is true or not, and what's the worst thing that could happen? We take down your network?""

We both got a good laugh out of that

$SC ""Yes, let's do it, what do we have to lose? What do we do?""

$Me ""Start unplugging patch cables until we start getting replies back to my pings.  If they stabilize then it's a broadcast storm, if they don't then this switch is probably faulty.""

I start the persistent ping and we start unplugging cables while I keep an eye on the ping.  We get to the very last cable and, up until this point we had no luck, but once we unplugged the SFP module the switch magically stabilized.

$ Me (with a smirk on my face): ""Looks like we found the cause of the issue.  Your switch is fine, but we have to find where the loop is.  Where does this fiber module go?""

$SC ""That goes to an out building with offices, i've got keys we can go over there.  Can we isolate it and get the hospital back online?""

$Me ""Yes, let's plug these cables back in and everything should be ok very quickly once the APs power back up.""

By this point i've been on hold for maybe 2 minutes.  I unmute my mic.

$Me ""Hey guys, we found the cause of the issue.  The switch is fine, this is a broadcast storm""

$BB ""A broadcast storm? What the hell is that? Is that even a thing? That doesn't sound real""
$B ""Yes it's a real thing and it's not good.  Katha, why do you think that?""

I explained my troubleshooting steps.

$B ""Ok, yeah that sounds like a broadcast storm to me.  Go to the offices with $SC and see if we can locate the loop.  Stay on the line with us so we can guide you""

$Me ""Yeah, ok"" *eye roll*

We verify everything in the hospital has started coming back up, and off to the other building we go.  We go through several IDFs until we isolated the loop to a single section of offices that the SC didn't have a key to.

$SC ""Disconnect them.  If they fucked up they can deal with no internet until I can get in there and find out where this loop is""

We disconnected the offices and hooked up the out building back to the network and verified everything was good.

At this point it's midnight.  We verify everything is good and I leave.  Got home at 2AM.  Back up at 8AM to get back to work, with the expectation of atleast a high-five.

$BB and $B ""Katha we need to have a word about your actions last night""

$Me ""Sure, what's up?""

$B ""You didn't include us in any of your troubleshooting, we were effectively in the dark.  We told you earlier that we didn't want you doing anything without us telling you.  You went rogue.""

$Me ""I went rogue?! I saved them several thousand dollars instead of replacing a switch that was perfectly good, we got their network up in a fraction of the time it would have had I followed your directions.  What exactly did I do wrong there?""

$BB ""None of that matters, you are too inexperienced to be making these decisions and taking troubleshooting in your own hands.  You made you, me and $B look very unprofessional.  You need to learn to follow directions.""

$Me (defeated) ""Ok.  Sorry for fixing their problems""

Unfortunately for them, $SC was extremely happy with my performance, and extremely pissed at my bosses.  His email said as much, to the account executive and bosses.

He called me up personally and thanked me for my hard work that night, and gave an update on what he found.  The next morning he heard complaints of no internet in those offices.  He went over and found an idiot had plugged a patch cable from one wall port into another, no idea why.  He lit that employee up about the $2000 bill he was about to receive.  He was pissed when I off-hand mentioned that I was reprimanded for fixing their issues.",1,1635314428

1638,security policy? or not,"In my previous job I provided IT and general computer support for a University research department.   My group was also tasked to assist the office of the Dean of our School within the University since they had no IT support of their own, and they didn't want to rely on the main University IT department as these folks had a less than stellar reputation.

The Dean was a pretty cool guy, and it was very good policy to help him as much as possible.   Its always good to have your boss's, boss's, boss on your side.

At one point our main University IT guys were getting gigged by outside auditors for allowing use of ""free"" file sharing services.  Needless to say, many professors all over the University were using such services to distribute assignments, updates, quizzes, and the like to students.   However since such services are totally insecure, use was to be discouraged.   This came up once in a meeting I had with the Security Officer for our main IT department, a person I had worked with a lot and respected.  He informed me that was against University policy to use free file sharing by any member of faculty or staff.   I didn't use such services so I just filed this conversation away.

Sometime later I was meeting with Dean about a special project and the issue of how to distribute some information, and he said ""we could just use &lt;free\_file\_share&gt;"".  I mentioned that I had been informed that this was against policy, stated to me by the SO.  Dean just said that this was the craziest thing he had every heard, and if I had a chance please get the actual policy as written in the official University policy manual.   I didn't follow up on this at the time but not much later the matter came up in another meeting.

This meeting was with the Deputy CIO and a member of the CIO's staff.  I don't remember what we were discussing but as we were finishing up I remembered the Dean's request, recounted my conversation, and asked if they could point me to the policy.

The staff member launched into a long, meandering, statement about how we were all responsible for data security, and should be setting a good example to the rest of the users at the University, and how we all needed to follow best practices.   I answered that I agreed with everything he had just said, but could he please tell where I could find this policy?

Staff member started to basically repeat everything he had just said, and also had twisted in his chair so he now looking away from me, avoiding eye contact.  I glanced over at the DCIO who was sitting very quietly, not looking at either one of us.  I'm thinking this is really weird.  The DCIO was someone I had worked with off and on, liked and respected, so I was totally confused as to why my question seemed to be such a problem.

Staff person finally finished their speech, I again stated that I agreed with everything, but I still would like the official policy since the Dean has specifically ASKED me to get it.   I'm beginning to get a bit pissed off since I'm asking a perfectly reasonable question.   Staff member started to rehash his speech for the third time, kind of has an edge to his voice like I'm being unreasonable or maybe I'm just too stupid to understand what he's saying.    I look at the DCIO again,  she staring down at the table with her hands shading her eyes.

I break in on the speech and ask again about the policy.   DCIO drops her hands, looks straight ahead and announces, ""ITS NOT A POLICY"".   Both the staff person and I shut up, and there's silence.   I just calmly say, ""thank you"".  

DCIO proceeded to explain that they were working on setting up a secure file sharing option, at which point they would implement a policy forbidding use of free services.   I didn't ask anymore about this, it was pretty clear they both were kind of embarrassed, apparently they had been pushing this ""policy"" and no one had ever asked to see it in writing.  

A bit later I updated the Dean and he had a laugh at my description of the conversation.  It remains one of the more surreal experiences of my time in that job.",1,1635273251

1640,Password working exactly as intended.,"Got a call today from a user who used the self service PW reset site, but now is unable to login to a vendor program. This vendor program does not use the same PW as AD creds so simple call right?

Heh... yeah... yeah no. 

&gt; $DU = Dumb User  
&gt; $Me = Me

&gt; $Me - Thanks for callin IT this is $ME how can I be of assistance.   
&gt; $DU - Yeah I reset my PW on the PW reset website, but now my *vendor program* wont let me log in.   
&gt; $Me - Are you trying your new password you just set on the PW site?  
&gt; $DU - Yes.   
&gt; $Me - That's why. The *vendor program* password does not change when you reset your citrix/email password. You will need ot use your old password for it.   

10 seconds of silence. 

&gt; $DU - My new password still is not working for *Vendor Program*  
&gt; $Me - I guess what I said did not come through, sorry about that. Your *vendor program* password does not change when you reset your citrix/email password. You will need to use your old password for that. 

30 seconds of silence. 

&gt; $Me - Hello?  
&gt; $Du - Yes sorry. One sec. *Typing* Yeah my password still is not working on *vendor program*  
&gt; $Me - Your old password?   
&gt; $DU - No my new.   
&gt; $Me - Uhh. Is my phone cutting out?   
&gt; $Du - No. You sound just fine.   
&gt; $Me - Yeah so your *vendor program* password does not reset when you update your Citrix or email passwords. Try the old password you had for *vendor program* before you reset your citrix PW today.   

Long silence.   

&gt; $Me - You there?  
&gt; $DU - Yes sorry.   
&gt; $ME - Try the old password.   
&gt; $DU - The old password for what?  
&gt; $Me - For *Vendor program please* Try the old password you have for it.   
&gt; $DU - But i reset it today.   
&gt; $Me - Just... try the old password for it please.  

She does. 

&gt; $DU - Oh that worked. Why did the password I reset not work for *vendor program* and I have to use this old PW?  
&gt; $Me - *Audible, exhasperated sigh* Because *Vendor Program* has its own credentials that do not change when you reset your citrix/email password.    

I will give you exactly one guess as to what happens next. 

&gt; $DU - So why did I have to use my old PW. Is something wrong with my account?   
&gt; $Me - No. I guess I am failing to properly explain this and I apologize for that. When you reset your PW today, you used this website correct? *Gives PW reset website.*   
&gt; $Du - Yes.   
&gt; $Me - OK that ONLY resets the intranet, email, citrix, and *our company* branded programs. It does not change *these 3 vendor programs* passwords. So when you reset your password on *PW site* it does not change the *vendor program* password.   

A full minute of silence with me repeatedly trying to get her attention. 

&gt; $DU - Oh sorry im here. So whats wrong with my account?   
&gt; $Me - Nothing. Your password is working exactly as intended. 

I hung up the phone and wrote it up as. ""Helped user get into *vendor program* using her old password. She either was not listening or simply failed to understand that *vendor program* and AD were separate entities. Terminated call and cried myself to sleep.""

No one called to complain and we never heard back from her today.",1,1635269719
1641,Welcome to the bullpen. Careful what you browse for...,"Just a quick flashback to my earlier days in IT.

I had been hired as an IT temp at a local manufacturing company.  The IT operations group sat in a bullpen with our desks facing the outer wall and a nice workbench in the center.  There was no privacy and we had nice 21inch monitors.

One of my first tasks was to replace a failed IDE drive in a desktop computer.  Wanting to impress, I was being certain to check configurations before connecting the drive.  

This Seagate drive had master/slave jumpers with odd markings and no install manual so I jumped on my computer to find one.  Wanting to be most efficient in my search, I typed in the exact model number of the drive, ""ST..."" and nothing else.  Unfortunately, this was also the filename of a very up close and personal image of the female anatomy being pleasured.  Even more regrettably, my browser was set to automatically open the most likely result and my new boss was just walking through.

I panic, and scramble to explain what just appeared on my screen.  Thank goodness, she believed me.  ""You may want to let \[NetAdmin\] know that the proxy server is down.""",1,1635257280
1642,"New boss, new hell","Many years ago I was part of the Unix tech support team managing a set of high end IBM Power servers (p595's). Our team leader was a cool guy who was a real IBM geek, he was also not confrontational in any way.

The company employed a new IT director and in the way these things always go, he decided to stamp his authority on the data center and called in contractors for an audit of the systems. This happened to be on the week our team lead was heading off on vacation. The auditors turned up and the IT director told us to hand over all the root passwords for the systems as the auditors had scripts they needed to run. Everything went well until just before the end of normal hours, the auditors kicked off their script on a server and the terminal hung. There were mutterings, a shrug of shoulders and a comment of ""it sometimes does that, it will be a while running, just kick off the others and we can grab the results in the morning"". They then ran their scripts on the remaining servers, noted the hanging sessions, disconnected and left for the day.

Then the phones started ringing, systems were unavailable and customers were complaining. We couldn't get logged into any of the systems, all the connections we tried just timed out. The crap well and truly hit the fan and eventually a call was received from out team lead along the lines of ""my phone is going mad with alerts, what's happening?"". A brief explanation was given and we tried to gain access while he guided us on the phone. Nothing. Eventually , he said ""hang on, I will be there in around 90 minutes"". Apparently, he went to the airline desk, rescheduled the family flights, booked his family into a hotel and then hired a car to drive back to the data center. 

What had happened was the auditors had run their scripts on the Virtual IO servers on a LPAR partitioned server. In the heading of the scripts was a note specifically saying ""DO NOT RUN THIS SCRIPT ON A VIO SERVER"". The script caused a component of the VIO code to panic and drop the VIO server. Not an issue if you have redundant VIO servers, but a big issue if you run the script on every VIO server one after the other. Instead of looking at why the first session crashed, the auditors just carried on and ran their script on every VIO server in the data center. Every partition lost access to both networks and storage and we uncovered another issue which was preventing us accessing the VIO server console from the Hardware Management Console.

Our team leader left his family at an airport hotel, drove over 90 minutes from the airport and then spent a good 4 hours fixing the issues, documenting root cause before he left to go back the 90 or so minutes to the airport and fly out a day late on his vacation. I learned two things that day, first some managers put in charge of tech support teams should never have any responsibility given to them and second very few companies truly recognise the value of the quiet unassuming people who have exceptional technical expertise and dedication. The team leader left the company about a year later and to the best of my knowledge, was never rewarded for his efforts that night.",1,1635252868
1643,pas terrible OR How I learned to stop worrying and love the French language,"This is from back when I was an exchange admin. We had just finished up migrating from lotus notes to the new O365 system. It had its hiccups and outages, but it worked for the most part. This is the story of what happened when we implemented multi-factor authentication for everyone's account. It should be noted that this office is located in a French speaking region, but the unofficial business language is English (meaning that day to day business is conducted in English). It should also be noted that I speak French like an American horse.

This is not a verbatim conversation:

User: bonjour, j'ai un problème pour me connecter à ma messagerie! je ne peux pas travailler !

Alright, I think to myself, looks like someone is having trouble accessing email. Probably because user needs to set up MFA for first time use.

Me: D'accord madamme, je peut assist avec votre problemme. SVP trouvez le procedure pour faire le MFA pour votre compte. Apres vous fait ca, vous pouvez acceder votre compte.

(ok, ma'am, i can help with that. please find the proceduce for doing MFA on your account attached. Once you do that, you can access your account.)

User: je ne sais pas comment ! (I don't know how!)

So I call the user and take control of her PC (after a lot of back and forth about quick assist codes). I do the needful and set up her MFA. She receives the SMS code and accesses her account.

User: Donc à chaque fois que je dois me connecter je dois recevoir ce code ?

Me: Oui, chaque fois vous login sur votre compte, vous doit faire le code comme ca. Mais, sur Outlook Desktop, c'est en memoire, donc ce pas necessaire chaque fois tu demarre votre PC. Seul si tu accedere par le browser ou par une autre ordinateur. 

(yes, each time you log in to your account, you will have to do the code like that. But on outlook desktop, it's in memory so it's not necessary each time you start your PC. Only if you login on the browser or on another PC.)

User: C'est pas terrible. 

Now THIS is where it went all wrong. To my english speaking ass, this sounds like it's not terrible. As in, it's not so bad. No, no, no. So I cut the call, thank her, etc. thinking all the while that she had accepted the outcome, and while it wasn't ideal, is was good enough.

Cut to  a few days later. My boss calls me into his office. He's a good guy, best boss I've ever had. He looks out for us and isn't afraid to tell the users when they're being stupid. He's also good at telling them that in a way that makes everyone feel good. Also, he speaks no french at all.

Boss: Alex, i got a user complaint for you. She gave a 1 out of 5 for everything. What happened?

Me: I told her about MFA and set it up for her. At the end of the call, she sounded a bit despondent about it, but said it's not too bad.

Boss: Yeah, that's what she said here too, under the comment section. ""C'est pas terrible."" oh well, I guess the 1 star rating was a mistake.",1,1635252013

For some background I have support responsibilities at a law firm, and anyone who knows the setting knows that paralegals are some of the most high strung people on the face of the planet. Partially because they're beholden to lawyers and partially, at least in my mind, because they're not lawyers and feel the need to make up for it by being spastic. They have also predominantly become remote workers during the pandemic and it hasn't helped the issue. This story concerns one such paralegal.

PL: Paralegal

OT: Old tech guy, my predecessor, really good at making people think he's a magician.

SKD: Little old me.

Now for the *meat* of the story.

SKD: That's a bummer. Do you have a moment for to remote in and troubleshoot this?

*roughly 3 hours of radio silence*

PL: Sorry, so busy today you know how it is!

SKD: No problem at all, I'll just hop in and have a look around.

PL: Yeah it took OT 2 hours to fix this the last time I had issues. I'm always having these weird problems. Do you think I could get a new prin-?

SKD: Hey, I'm not having any issues communicating with the printer from your device. Could you take a look at it and tell me if there are any errors?

PL: *getting more faint over the phone as she walks away* Oh I'm sure it's not that I just have terrible luck with tech- Oh. It looks like my kids used all the paper without telling me. Well. I guess I won't take up more of your time.

SKD: Oh man haha it happens. Have a great one!

Keep in mind we have a pretty specific policy in place that the firm-issued home use printers are not supposed to be used for non-firm related items. They're on a contract that automatically bills us for usage. The last time I helped her out she called my competence into question by encouraging me to just go and ask my predecessor how he had fixed her issue the last time. Someone had missed a period in the IP address when they configured her printer. Definitely worth consulting folks over.",1,1635251498
1645,P is for portal,"In this story, I am the one who needed the support. Therefor I hope that it's still is a valid post in here, although the humor is quite... Light.

Some time ago, I added a WAP to my home network. It came without any means of power delivery, that's why I bought a simple poe injector with it. I plugged everything in, saw the lights on the WAP start blinking as described in the manual and tried to register it to the cloud management portal, which did not work. That's when I opened a ticket with the manufacturers helpdesk.

After a bit back an forth, answering all the standard questions, we decided that he (the help desk employee) wanted to remot into my machine and have a look himself.

All danty with that, session established, he opens my browser and starts to type in the URL for the management portal, which starts with the word portal.

As soon, as he had typed the letter P, the little rat of a browser decided to spit out what it though was a nice collection of urls I may could try to access... Let's say, the portal was number 7 or 8.

There was a brief moment of silence on the line, as we both stared at the screen. He then proceeded to type in the URL and talked over it with some background informations about ports that have to be open for the WAP to communicate with the server.

In the end it was a DOA poe injector, which provided power but would not pass data.

And hats off to that support employee. I hope you are well and had a good laugh out of that. Cheers!",1,1635246987
1646,The larger they are..,"Lurker usually. English 2nd language. Formatting should be good (on Desktop)

I started in a small-ish company (US multi-national - one of the European offices) October 2008. 

Slowly, the company grew - bought some smaller ones, got bought, bought more - and now we are all 'one'. 

Except that we are not.

Every company has their own CRM / Ticket system etc.  
And EVERY new acquisition gets their IT people taken out, and assigned to 'projects' - but the day to day support goes to people like me - except - they forget that we are not trained in X, Y and Z - as we use A, B and C , and have just understood D exists as well. 

But - we still plod on (just a side note - I am one of those that thrives in a support role - and being made a manager is my worst nightmare - as that means meetings, meetings, group calls, discussions - but zero actual work - at least, that\`s here).

So, now they think to add 'replace building infra for projectors etc' to my task as well.   
Sure, talk to vendors, explain what we have, what we need, what I want (easy to use - not having to do a 3 day immersion training to operate - and a manual in plain English or Dutch .. or even German and French - i don\`t care - but not something based on Korean, translated by a drunk Chinese person using google translate and then translated again by a Russian high as a kite before getting to English)  
So, they walk around, we talk, and in comes a reasonable quote which more or less offers what we want and need (except the manual).

Hello management - here\`s the quote - and if too high, we can do without the Barco Clickshare addition as that\`s 'luxury'.  
One of the projectors broke down - but nothing happens.

We\`re now 4 months further - and 3 managers asked me 'when will this get replaced' with increasing urgency - but.. dudes (all men) - you .. yes, YOU still haven\`t approved the budget. You know - my approval amount is $250 for purchases - the rest i need YOU to sign off and approve. 

So major meeting - 'we need all working - can you order new' - No. Still not approved - here is the email chain about this including the quote (again) for your review.  
Managed to get broken projector up - as of course nothing - so meeting went well - but we\`re now a month after the meeting and still no approval. 

How do you train management to listen for once to what the 'grunts' say?",1,1635230417

1648,I need to fix my screen with new graphic card drivers!,"This one is hilarous, and pretty recent.

I now work as a tech support in a rather large corporate, sometimes we get the most insane crazy calls  were people try all kinds of things in order to hide their own ""wrong doings"". 

A lady called us about a screen that wasn't working properly on a laptop, she started the conversation by literally ordering me to install her a new graphics driver on her laptop.

I asked her why she thinks she needs a new graphics driver for her laptop? We usually auto-update ALL of those drivers with our usual remote service updates we perform on a regular basis as a part of the service agreement we have with all of our users, and this is usually a routine that is executed on an routinely basis by our own proprietary in-house developed updating system.

She told me to just trust her and do my goddamn job, she was pretty irate and sounded very stressed out.

As you may already know, being an IT-Tech service supporter is half psychology and half tech, and she being one of our own co-workers I tried talking casually with her to calm her down and make her feel more comfortable.

She told me to just log-on already and perform the diagnosis on her laptop and fix the screen.

I asked if she could see anything on the screen, she told me no - well yes.... there were some funny stripes here and there. I asked her if it had worked previously the day before, or if it happened suddenly or if it was just occuring now and then...

She was like, nope, it turned black this morning, and I better just do my job and remote to her laptop and do my job.

I could not see her laptop on our system, it was currently off-line. 

She asked me how come? Well I told her to connect it to the network, wifi network or similar so I could log on and service it. But she said:

How can I do that if I can't see the screen?

Maybe you can connect it to an external monitor if you have one? Well no, she didn't have that.

I asked her how come it's all of a sudden blacked out with those ""weird lines"" on it?

Well it was more like cracks in the screen she said!

...Cracks in the screen? Really? Like broken glass?

Yeah maybe...she said (sounded nervous).

Okay, then - is the screen itself broken?

She responded ""well - yeah - DUH"", can't you just install the drivers and make it work again?

I tried investigating a little further, okay - how come there's cracks on the screen?

She paused for a long time, and then told me she had ran over the laptop with her car, she placed the laptop bag behind the wheel of her car, and forgot it, and ran over it when she backed up.

...

The student running the table hadn't ever met someone who hadn't scanned a QR code before.  The woman checking in hadn't ever scanned one before.

Teacher walks in and I ask about the camera she says it's in the library (huh?). She's an older woman and not great with technology. I go to the librarian. We're both confused. She gives me one of the many document cameras. I go back to the classroom and there she is - The Meddler (cue super villain music) - sitting next to the teacher that submitted the order.

She can't simply submit a work order and allow me to do my job. I'm sure she wouldn't like it if I tried to teach her class.

Meddler: Oh hi, IT guy! (she always says that. So annoying) I installed the software and the camera still won't work. 

Me (knowing that it's impossible to install with her login): Yeah you aren't able to install software I have to login in with admin credentials or mine.

1652,"I don't want a new screen, I need my icons.","This is some years ago, but it's still funny and I'll never forget it so here is my story.

I used to work at a ad agency with lots of POS and Key account managers, I was their graphics artist and also their IT-Tech supporter.

One day our boss decided to change the entire interior of the office, everyone was happy about that, the company was doing well and we wanted to change the entire interior to something fresh and nice, you know - as a kickoff to our new success and prosperity.

Ofc. my job was to make sure our IT equipment was top notch, new computers, new cabling, new screens and all.

Most of our staff isn't very IT savvy at all, and this one lady in particular wasn't very tech oriented, but very stylish and knew her fashion. In fact she was a rich kid from the richest family in our country at the time, but that's kinda besides the point. 

I was about to give her a brand new wide-screen monitor and she yelled at me ""WHAT ARE YOU DOING?"".

Err, I'm about to give you a new shiny bigger and better monitor.

She said: Are you CRAZY? Do you know how many years it has taken me to organize my desktop icons? I have a ton of contact information, PDF files and images I need on my desktop.

I tried to explain to her that they would still be there, it's just the screen I'm replacing.

She looked at me like I was the crazy one and kept on yelling at me: You idiot, I have all my shortcuts and documents well organized on that screen, if you replace that screen I will have to redo years of work.

Calmly yet again I tried explaining to her the concept of computers and windows...that those Icons and shortcuts are on her Windows installation on the computer itself, and that the Desktop shortcuts and contents will be untouched.

She kept on yelling at me, Untouched? You're quite literally replacing my screen were the Icons are, are you so lost you don't get that? 

My co-workers heard this and they had to literally crawl under their ""IRL"" desktops in order to hide the fact they were literally dying from laughter, I was a bit shook by her erratic behaviour so I couldn't even laugh, I tried thinking in laymens terms and imagine from her point of view (with zero computer knowledge) how to explain it to her in a way she would ""get it"".

We ended up letting her keep her monitor, there were no way to explain to her this, she just wouldn't understand. She really held on to the monitor as I was going to demo for her that the icons would still be there, but she kept blocking it like her life depended on it.

1653,Network Issues!,"I was working afterhours this week (Helpdesk for a small MSP) and saw a ticket that had been emailed in. The subject was ‘Network Issues!’ and the user stated he was trying to connect to the company WiFi on his laptop with his AD credentials (all of our clients are on Radius), but it was giving him an incorrect security key error. He said he couldn’t call but it was urgent. I checked his account for bad password attempts or lockouts but couldn’t find anything. 

Replied asking for him to take a pic of the error with his phone and email me back. He sent back a picture of the WiFi credentials pop up with an SSID of ‘Hotel XYZ Guest WiFi’. I politely asked him to contact the front desk and get the WiFi password from them, and then try to login.

1654,'But it doesn't have a second tray',"It was that time of the multi-year cycle. Time for new printers. That time where a disproportionate amount of the IT budget but spent on big, expensive, bulky printers even for the departments that for some reason have desk printers on top of departmental ones because enough of them complained to the right people that they got desk printers for 'workflow efficiency'.

Anyway, per usual the behemoth industrial upright printers were being replaced with very slightly smaller behemoths that had new shiny software and a sleeker more modern look. The printer makes/models/specs were cleared with all department heads before ordering and were exact matches for the previous printers spec wise except with a higher PPM and lacking a finisher add-on that the previous printers had that went unused in all departments with few enough exceptions that our graphics printer could take care of it.

Everything went remarkably smoothly, the new drivers deployed without a hitch, and everyone was happy.... Except one department. 

This department called and complained almost immediately that 'it didn't have a second tray'. The printers have the same number of paper trays including 1 bypass so there was a bit of confusion on our part the lack of additional trays would definitely be an issue since many departments need multiple paper sizes available at the same time without constant swapping however we double checked and all the trays were present and accounted for..... Until we were shown by the complainee that the old printer had 2 **output** trays. One in the body and one on the finisher. This was a purely cosmetic second tray that came out of the finisher if booklets were being made and had no bearing on the amount of prints/copies the printer could process. Copies would also come out of the finisher tray but only after a normal print job completed. We of course let them know that the lack of a second tray doesn't affect print speed and that their copies/prints would come out at even faster speed but that didn't seem matter. 

""It used to work that way"", the most dangerous phrase in the organization, was brought out. Then my bosses boss was contacted and they complained. We made our case, they made their case, **and......**

Several thousand more dollars were spent on a finisher add-on so they could have their paper come out in 2 different places.",1,1635181937
1656,I don't want a new one...,"I'll keep it short, if I can.

We had just returned to our place of work after over a year due to social distancing.

A user came to my office complaining that their laptop wouldn't connect to the internet or print, it turns out this machine hadn't been upgraded to Win 10 prior to the lockdown and was therefore no longer compatible with my internet filtering system and our hold print system.

I explained this to the user and said not to worry I can back up your data and upgrade your CURRENT machine to Win 10 and let you carry on as normal.

I was backed up on jobs and explained I wouldn't be able to do this for at least a few days, they are more than welcome to borrow one of 30 brand new laptops in the meantime.

The user scoffed and said they want their current one as they don't ""like the look"" of the much newer machines. I shrugged and said suit yourself.

2 days later

User AND their management come into the office raging saying they haven't been able to work for 2 whole days, I was actually quite taken back by this as I hadn't been used to face to face stupidity for some time. I thoroughly explained to the situation to their management, they immediately turned to the user and asked them to leave the room.

1657,"Remove our admin permissions, we will wait for the grief to come pouring down from above","This happened about 20 years ago, as I was starting my IT career. The organisation I was working for was an early adopter, and had just rolled out Windows 2000, and Delegated Control was still a good idea a long way off being implemented. It was discussed making this happen by the Sys Admins, but not implemented to allow the Help Desk to have granulated permissions, but this had not been worked out yet. 

I was still on the help desk, and worked with Alec. Alec had been around, since I think Noah was building the ark, and possibly handed him the hammer when needed, so Alec knew everyone and had interesting stories to tell. If Alec is on here, he can tell his own stories. 

The computer corporation that the organisation had hired to manage 2nd and 3rd level escalations above help desk decided that the lowly help desk peons (Alec and I) could not have domain administration permissions any more, as we were doing the work and taking cases off them, that meant they could not justify as many man hours they were charging our organisation. So on Wednesday night our accounts were removed from the elevated permissions, without notifying us. Possibly our managers were notified, but not what the implications were. 

Here comes the Compliance, see all we could do now, was catch and despatch, nothing else. Simply take the call, and log it into the helpdesk system, saying someone needed their account unlocked to be able to work, someone else wanted to change their password, as they had forgotten their password, and another person needed access to a specific folder on the file server/s. This is all run of the mill level one tasks that takes seconds to complete. However not this Thursday, see the computer corporation that day needed to do their weekly team building meeting, that I was not privy to, not working for them, however I am sure they were told how much extra money they would be making doing all these extra cases. 

Alec started after me, as he then had the later finish, so I explained our lack of access now, and that we would have to simply catch and dispatch calls now, with the computer corporation doing all the work. This is boring and what gives help desk roles a really bad name. Alec wanted to go our managers to get this changed immediately, however I convinced him to comply with the corporation’s diktat. We would allow the people directly affected by not being able to work to complain to their managers, then they would complain to ours, so we don’t look like we are being difficult to the computer corporation new stance, whom we had to get along with. 

Ohh yes they did complain, the manager for computer corporation got hauled out of their team meeting to fix things up, so we could do our work and our colleagues could then do theirs. When their manager asked why we did not say these cases were backing up, we replied we could not change / unlock passwords, and they were busy in their meeting and we were asked previously not to disturb them. 

Petty I know, but we did get our admin rights back before lunchtime. Also now things are massively changed and domain admin rights are not handed out so fast. But this was early days of Windows 2000.

Dad says he doesn't trust the mother to turn it in at the end of the year. He signed for it. Student can't do her work.

Me: and?

Librarian: Well the kid needs to do her work.

Me: The father won't return school property. Call the cops

Librarian returns to the office looking very confused. She returns a few minutes later. 

Librarian: Well how do we resolve this?

Me: Jeez. Tell the father to bring the laptop to the school. You can sign something for him absolving him of responsibility for it. Then the mother can pick it up from here.

Principal (who has now walked in to here this): Yeah I guess we can do that. I was just wanting to get another laptop for the student.

Context is this: my friend 'Susan' is a young woman working in a male-dominated industry, in a job she describes as ""between sales and tech"". She often trains the sales people on how to use some of the software, this story is from one of those times. 

Susan was working with a guy from sales 'Jack', who has previously requested to get on calls with Susan for help with ""you really shouldn't need help with this"" kind of issues. Jack requested a call with Susan for help with a particular software tool (the actual purpose of the software is irrelevant). The software in question had a 'profile' section for the user, and the profile section allowed the user to upload and crop a profile image. 

Jack had some issue with the cropping tool, asked Susan to get on a call to help. Susan does the normal troubleshooting steps, gets to the point where she can see the actual error message, and here's what she finds

&gt; ERROR: crop selection must fit within the image area

Yes, the issue is what you'd think it was - Jack tried to 'crop' the whole image and then some -  and Jack wanted help understanding the error. I happened to be in the room when Susan was on the call, and her professionalism about the matter lasted right up to the call ended.",1,1635020709

Short little story, but I thought yall might enjoy it. Prior to these events I spent a bit over a year as a technician fixing all types of issues on copiers and printers.

One day I'm working my side gig (where I'm not in any sort of support role) and I'm in the office of one of my bosses. He's one if those guys, you know the type. Can't be wrong, knows everything, and regularly makes a fool of himself with his ""knowledge.""

Boss is trying to print out a document, and keeps getting the same result, the first page prints, then the back side has a line of odd random characters, then the 3rd page will print normal. Boss is getting increasingly annoyed by this, thinking his printer is broken. 

I decided to pipe up before he gets too angry and explain his issue to him. Most of us have seen this by now, and probably already know where I'm going. I explain to him that he's using a generic default driver for his printer, which is fine for some basic stuff, but with everything on this document, including the duplexing, it's not going to work correctly due to the computer and the printer not communicating properly. I explain to him that due to the set up of our systems he needs to contact IT and have them install the correct driver, since we're locked out of all admij functions.

The entire time I'm talking, this guy just keeps going on with ""nah""  ""that's not it""  ""it's something else""  and even goes so far as to tell me ""you don't know what your talking about.""

I finally just gave up, and sat there staring at him with a blank face. After a moment he just full stops, and slowly you can see the realization dawning on him. He was fully aware that my other gig was copier technician. He finally gives me a sheepish look and says ""I just remembered who I'm talking to""

1679,"What starts as a radio repair ends in being told about the ""Hispanic Turtle Men""","So this happened today and I figured I should write it out while it's still fresh. It's so ridiculous that I still am reeling from it.

So I work a small shop where people can bring in various bits of tech for us to repair. Today an elderly woman comes in with an old weather radio and asked me to fix it for her. At first the conversation seems normal enough. She explains how her husband died recently and he had left her the radio and she wanted to have it fixed. So I start having her fill out our little sign in sheet. That's when the crazy started. I ask her to put down her phone number so we can contact her.

Her: No. I have too many people coming in and out of my house. I'd never even hear it. I'll just check back on friday.

Ok... odd but nothing...

Her: I don't even know these people either! It's ridiculous! I've tried locking the doors but those damned lasers...

Me: Uhhh.... Lasers?

Her: Yeah. You know. Those lasers the CIA uses to get in to your house.

For a moment I'm so taken aback by this that I'm certain she's messing with me. Then she continued...

Her: They want to try to kick me out of my house but I'm not going. I know it was them. Just the other day these mexicans in turtle costumes kicked in my back door.

Me: ...uhhh...

Her: Now those hispanic turtle men tried saying that they were there to check on me but I know better. They're just trying to help the CIA...

I cut her off here, trying to steer the clearly mentally ill woman back to what we were doing, hoping maybe I could just have her fill the paperwork out and be done with this but she ignores me and continues to tell me how the hispanic turtle men are being led by someone named ""The Walrus"". I'm looking at my coworker to try and help me. He hears what she's talking about and immediately runs for the backroom to avoid having to do anything here. She sees how I'm looking at him and proceeds to get mad, yelling 

Her: ""You don't believe me do you?!? You think I'm CRAZY?!?! I thought you would understand. I remember you used to work for the CIA!"" (Mind you I have never seen this woman in my life)

1680,No I won't use that computer fix this one,"I was a student technician for a satellite campus of a larger university. We were in the middle of implementing a new print system having inexplicable intermittent errors on all student PC's at every level of the university when trying to print once it happened nothing would fix it until it decided to work again later. The guys above my head were furiously working on a fix but the only consistent work around we had was simply to move the student to another PC.

I had just clocked in and notice there was a 45 minute old ticket put in from a student account. I ask my supervisor if that issue had been taken care of and was told no. As that was the only open ticket myself and the other student tech who also just clocked in decided to walk over to the location in another building and found for some reason the student was still there and they were... furious.

I do remember explaining that I had just clocked in and there had been a brief lapse of coverage for low level requests but the wait had obviously soured their mood. They then showed me the print error pop-up. I explained that this issue was happening intermittently across our new print system and I couldn't fix it on that PC. I offered to put the document on a flash drive and walk over to the lab across the hallway where a different computer could be used to release the job.

That was their breaking point. Being asked to physically move was apparently the last straw  they started yelling in my face (the other tech had escaped at this point having seen where it was going). HOW DARE I TELL THEM TO MOVE TO ANOTHER PC I SHOULD BE ABLE TO FIX THIS PC IN FRONT OF THEM THEY PAY THEIR STUDENT IT DUES THEY KNOW WHAT KIND OF SUPPORT THEY ARE ENTITLED TO THIS IS HORRIFIC MY BOSS WILL BE NOTIFIED THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE. 

At this point I kinda crack and start laughing hysterically. 

Believe it or not despite working around 4 years of retail prior to this point I had never ran into this level of... whatever it was. This felt like something straight out of a reddit post which just made the individual more angry. I then take a second to compose myself and then apologized and calmly re-explain that the issue is out of my hands and is affecting all PC's we have been under a lot of stress from the issue recently and the person just left.

The threat was actually followed through and the head of the IT department had a formal complaint filed against me.... which was laughed off as the other tech was an eye witness (from a bit down the hall) and could back up my side of the story.",1,1634858719

My team handles everything from the automation software (TIA, Step7) the user interface/HMI, SCADA servers, the IPCs and other smaller things needed like protocols, OPC-UA etc. 

Last week I drove on site and was basically on site tech support to help with everything they needed and help woth the factory acceptance trsts. Within that week I racked up 160 pages of paperwork that prove and make sure everything is correct and works as intended. It's a GxP environment so we make sure all documents are completed correctly and all certificates are valid. Afterwards they signed everything, stating that my official support job has ended and I'll only be staying on site for another two weeks in case of an emergency.

Today I get this call: (C = customer)

&gt; C: Good morning OP! I'm calling you because I have a request regarding the software and machine
&gt; Me: Good morning. What can I help you with?
&gt; C: Our engineers had the idea to implement an ultrasonic device to the production line to help the side feeders work better. Can you implement that for the final site acceptance test next week?
&gt; Me: .. Wait. That wasn't in scope was it? My boss didn't tell me about it. When did you discuss it?
&gt; C: Oh we haven't done that yet. I just wanted to call you in advance since you're already on site right now!
&gt; Me: So you want me to change all the documents, implement the ultrasonic device in our software, add it to the SCADA server, change the profibus and SPS adresses, test it and re-certify everything for GMP standards. Until next week? You know today is thursday right?
&gt; C: Exactly! It's only one device so it should be fast to implement it. You dont have to test the rest and just stick the changes of the documents as an appendix to the current version.
&gt; Me:  .. No. That's not how that works.
&gt; C: What do you mean? Its such a small change I could do it myself if I had the time.

Then I spend the next 30 minuzes explaining that   1) This was never discussed. I would need an official request for it, wich means I would get paid extra for it.   2) the documents have to be signed by multiple people, across 4 different companies who work on the project. Good luck getting a hold of them within a single day.   3) Its impossible to make software changes and then test them WITHOUT having the actual device on site.

1691,Encyclopædia Moronica: R is for Receipts Are Broughten,"Well, TFTS, it's been a hot minute or two... or seven months.

One of the things my current employer decided to do during the period when ***the whole world was on fire*** was to bring forward the merging of two divisions. It made sense that the divisions would merge, they performed technical tasks for customers, both ad-hoc and contracted service work, emergency call outs and scheduled maintenance.  
What made less sense was that I was pushed into the Supervisor Role - a purely administrative position. This made little sense, as I was the only person with the training, experience, and importantly, the certification that allowed me to carry out certain scheduled works. Ensuring this work is continuously up to date is important, as it provides a certain amount of legal cover for our customers. As a result, I was stuck trying to complete a 100% administrative office-bound role while ALSO trying to complete a 100% field-based role.

As you might imagine, this did not work - as good as I may be, I cannot be in two places at once.

However, after I (repeatedly) brought this up with my Manager (Regional), and his Manager (National), I eventually managed to drive home my point.

&gt; National Manager (NM): You need a business case for new staff! And it better be a good one, because we're in a hiring freeze right now due to the merger.

&gt; ME: How about backfilling position for the technician that you just promoted into management? Is that a good enough business case? Because I'm consistently doing between 60 and 80 hours a week here, and nobody seems to care.

A scant six months later, precisely nothing had happened. In mid-November, the pre-Christmas workload was ramping up hard, so I booked some leave for late January through to mid February. It was only a couple of weeks, I reasoned. It's more than two months, that's plenty of notice, I reasoned.

January finally arrived, and two days before my much anticipated leave was due to start, I noticed that it had not yet been approved. I emailed the Regional Manager, as he was the only one that could approve my leave, and sure enough, a few hours later, I received the email notification that my leave had been approved in the system.  
On Friday, I set an Out of Office message on my emails, changed my voicemail to reflect the date of my return, and turned my phone off. I did not turn it back on until the day I returned to work.

&gt; **EMAIL**  
&gt; FROM: Regional Manager  
&gt; SUBJECT: URGENT - IMMEDIATE RESPONSE REQUIRED
&gt; Sent: *{three days ago}*
&gt; To: Gambatte, CC: The Entire Fscking World - including the Affected Customer
&gt;
&gt; Gambatte
&gt;
&gt; I assigned you a task and you didn't complete it! I need a damn good reason why you didn't do it and I need it immediately!

I was intrigued. I was concerned. I was somewhat dubious about my prospects for continued employment.  
So I went down the rabbit hole.

And I drafted a reply.

&gt; To: Regional Manager, CC: The Exact Same Recipients - Including the National Manager
&gt;
&gt; I have looked into the issue and spoken with the technician involved. He began filling out the job clearance form but stopped midway through because he was able to identify from inside his vehicle that the damage exceeded what he would be able to repair, given the parts he had with him at the time. As such - having never left his vehicle or begun barricading off a work area - he did not complete the form. However it appears that this form was included in the monthly roll up, despite it's incomplete status.  
&gt; Normally, such a form would be identified by the Supervisor - myself - during the end of month process before it is sent to {Affected Customer}. However, I applied for leave in November, which you approved in January. When you emailed me the forms for review on February 1, I was already on leave - the leave that YOU approved less than a week earlier. An Out of Office email was sent TO YOU, to remind you that I was on annual leave; the text of which reads ""I will not return until at least February 15"", so I did not see your original email (dated Feb 1) with it's request to review these forms by Feb 3 until today (Feb 15).  
&gt; It would appear that YOU approved my leave but did not arrange cover for any tasks that would normally be assigned to me during my absence. It would also appear that YOU did not review the forms for completeness before forwarding them to {Affected Customer}.
&gt;
&gt; If you have any questions or require clarification on any of these points, please see the attached emails and screenshots. If you require any further clarifications, please let me know by reply email.

The crap raining down from the Regional Manager had only intensified after that. Finally, a mere nine months after he had originally promised me a replacement, the National Manager sent me an email that they had finally begun advertising for a new technician! Once the hiring process was completed, I would no longer need to ever leave the office again.

I picked up the phone, and told the National Manager not to bother hiring a new technician. The Regional Manager was discussed, in depth. The words ""constructive dismissal"" were used.  
I officially stepped down from the role and returned to full time technician status.

This morning, I received an urgent breakdown call. It was an older piece of equipment - older than some of the staff that operate it - so sudden catastrophic failure was definitely not outside the realm of possibility. There are also legal obligations to have said equipment running, so while not necessarily critical to operation, it was important to get it fixed or replaced ASAP.  
So I raced out to the customer's site, and quickly diagnosed the issue.

As I turned the power back on at the wall, one of the staff watching me spoke up.

&gt; Site Staff (SS): Is that all it was?

&gt; ME: It's back up now, so it looks like it!

&gt; SS: I'm so sorry! It must be so annoying to get called out for an emergency when it's actually something so simple!

1693,Lady waiting over a YEAR for TV box installation. I get the case.,"So since April I've started working for a TV/Broadband/Phone company after being made redundant and work on the tech team. We work with anything from installations, troubleshooting and upgrading services. Basically if you have a problem with any of those, I help you sort it.

So it was 8am and the first call of the day is a lady who is absolutely furious, at first it wasn't clear what the problem was but after reassuring her I wanted to help and that I'd look at the notes on her account and she can fill me in on what's been missed she calmed down a bit.

A year ago this lady paid over £100 to get a new TV box installed, only it had never been installed. From the notes and what the lady was telling me, every time an engineer went out they had an excuse as to why they weren't able to install it that day; ""Oh we don't have the right ladder"" ""We aren't trained for this kind of install"" ""We could try and access it from the other property, but we're not insured for that"".   
Why this lady had been left hanging like this made no sense to me and I promised her I'd get to the bottom of it. She already HAD TV services with us, but the upgraded box install was the problem and she was also a carer for a family member so had enough stresses, so I told her ""Don't worry about calling us, I will call you and text you updates.""

The next month was me giving her consistent updates, running around to managers and more experienced staff on install procedures to get the specific ladders and how to get the lady her money back because I couldn't re-submit an install without taking a payment. There was no override.

Eventually I figured it out; I called a specialist team to let them know about the property and have it marked so they knew exactly what equipment they'd need ahead of time. My manager got in touch with higher ups who confirmed we could give her the money back, then I could agree the date. I called the customer and told her the situation, we put the wheels in motion and I triple checked the order had all the flags it had needed and updated her each week before the install to let her know it was still going ahead and there were no delays.

The day after the install I called her to ask her if everything had gone okay; she was so grateful and said the new engineers we sent were so lovely and made her feel validated in all the problems she'd had. She thanked me for helping her and said ""I wish I could meet you and give you a hug"". I told her that I was glad to get her sorted and that knowing I'd helped fix things was more than enough for me.

So whenever I have a bad day or a customer is yelling at me that I'm terrible at my job and don't know what I'm doing (which happens), I always think about this lady and how much what I did meant for her and her family.",1,1634753841

You'd think a IT company would have decent equipment for testing and troubleshooting...

Our ""workshop"" (where we set up PCs, Servers etc. and do troubleshooting) is almost ancient.

&amp;#x200B;

It has 4 spare keybaords only 1 of wich is USB. The rest are PS/2. Our best testing machine is a 4th gen i3 with 4 GB RAM and a 64GB SSD (we installed Win11 on that). We have not even an external optical  drive in case we needed one.

We had a 3 TB HDD for backing up stuff from customers machines but that died the other day. My boss had me replace it with a random 8yo 1TB drive that was laying arround... yes, we back up costomers data on that.

We only have 1 HDMI calbe, but all of the 3 monitors in the workshop are DVI/VGA. We used to have only old 1280x1024 monitors, but my collegue and I got fed up with those up and replaced them with some old monitors we had home and didn't need. Now we have at least one that is Full HD and not pre-historic. Still no HDMI or, heaven forbid, DisplayPort. We have to use adapters for that (wich constantly disappear when we need them). This sucks, since 90% of new PCs we sell come with only DisplayPort/HDMI.

Happen to need a USB drive? Good luck with that, we're an IT support company, why would we have spare USB drives?

The other day my PC wasn't booting after I came back from vacation. The BIOS had reset and the SSD wouldn't boot anymore. Could still acess it externally though, I'm guessing Windows somehow bricked itself. Had to spend half a day makeshift building myself a working PC from parts we had laying arround. Of course I grabbed the most modern thing wich was a 4th gen i5. And the only reason I could get up and running and able to work again was because I know the domain admin password (my boss wasn't in the office that day). And I only know that because our server crashes occasionally and has to be manually restarted. One time it happened, my boss wasn't there and he had to tell me the passwort on the phone.

And my boss wonders why we sometimes struggle to get shit done or take ages. But don't ask for better stuff, ""we have everything we need"". But I guess it's a good thing we keep 10yo GPUs and ISDN cards because ""we might need them sometime"".",1,1634746010

1696,Someone told me to post this previous comment here: flashback 90s tech," 

In the late 90s and early 2000s OEM car company distributed it worldwide diagnostics system tool used for  repairing vehicles in their dealerships using Windows 98 as the OS. (Not  NT and defintely not a commercial grade OS, but I digress).

Whenever  a technician in the field had an issue with the software(which was  often), the first thing Tier 1 support would suggest was to reload the  software from disk.

The designed,  approved, and published correct loading process was : start up the  system and boot off the disk...watch the % completion bar on the  screen...After it is at 10%( 15 minute process), perform a hard  (Ctrl,Alt,Del) reset,...then reboot the system and load it again. It had  to do with disk partitioning as I recall, but that just seemed like the  laziest fix or initial software implementation I had ever seen up to  that time...

Another doozy from  that product: The portable PC had a problem with batteries not lasting  very long on each charge, since they were often temporarily disconnected  from their base during use. The fix was to create a battery  reconditioning program that promised to return the battery to its  longest lasting state, and took about 2 hours to run. SO far, so good.  Some proactive thinking technicians across the nation decided to perform  this every night so their precious and irreplaceable tool (of which  there were only a few in  each dealership for all the techs to share)  would be ready for max performance the next morning...a few months  later, all of these systems started dying and their expensive batteries  had to be replaced, as no one realized that these so-called smart  batteries would only allow themselves to be recharged 2500 times before  they would commit suicide and refuse any further attempt at recharging.  The original manufacturer of the battery packs made a killing off of  supplying the tens of thousands of battery packs to OEM car company Tier 1  diagnostics tool supplier.

User: It's not working

Me: you can't click and drag the screen? 

User: Can you take control and do it for me?

&amp;#x200B;

I then proceed to take control of her PC and note that display settings is closed. I then open settings, go into the display settings and click identify. 1 is on the right and 2 on the left.

&amp;#x200B;

Me: ok when i clicked identify, was 1 on the left screen and 2 on the right screen?

User:  yes 

&amp;#x200B;

I click and drag 1 so that it is on the left of 2, to match the physical location of her screens.

Me: so that ought to do it, I just dragged your screens in the disploy\[sic\] diagram to the correct positions 

User:  but i want the screen 1 to the right side please 

Me:  but when you click 'identify, is screen 1 on the right or left? 

User:  1 is now at the left side 

Me:  so on the diagram, 1 needs to also be on the left. 

User:  so we can not do anithing\[sic\] ? 

Me:  I don't understand, why do you want 1 to be on the right? 

User:  that is how i am confortable\[sic\]

&amp;#x200B;

I had to explain to her that this is how it needs to be if she wants to be able to move her mouse around from screen to screen in the way that they are meant to be. I was tempted to tell her to physically move her screens so 1 would be on the right and 2 on the left. but i didn't want to have any kind of liability in case she broke something.",1,1634720438

I worked as a ""technician"" that would work in shop and be sent out to a customer's address to help with IT related things. Sometimes this would entail fixing an issue or setting something up. One day I get a ticket stating the customer needs a mesh network setup, and I'm provided no other information. After waiting outside for around 25 minutes, the customer rolls into the driveway, and we get down to business. The conversation was something like this:

Customer: Hey, sorry for being late. I need a mesh network hooked up because the internet is too slow. 

Me: What exactly is slow? I'd like to get an idea of what exactly you are noticing. 

Customer: Well, we can't watch 4K movies, it just buffers the entire time on the Television. 

I take a speed test and the speed is some of the slowest I've seen, it was around a 2mbps down, and a .7 up. I advised her of this, and strongly recommended to speak with her ISP. I told her that the mesh network is mainly for coverage, and wouldn't make any noticeable difference on the speed. I mentioned she could return the item, and if needed we could have another look after the ISP had a look at their equipment. The customer apparently came back to the shop, and reamed out the sales team as she was sold an item she didn't need, and word got back to me and bingo. Let go. I always felt I did the right thing, but according to the company I lost the sale, oops.

1713,I hit “reset password” but I am not receiving any reset emails. I have tried nothing and am out of ideas!,"This is the freshest, hot-off-the-press story I've ever posted; this happened just 5 minutes ago. It took my brain a solid 60 seconds to reboot since it needed some firmware updates to handle the new levels of either laziness or ignorance consistently displayed by my $users. Love them.

So I got a simple ticket on Friday (from my least favorite $user &lt;3): 

***Is this email legit or no???***

It was a phishing test email sent out by our SysAdmin to gather data (read: trick $users into clicking) on how many of our users are failing security tests. I inform $user of this, and verify no links were clicked and tell her she's safe to delete it and good job for passing!

Except she then reopens the ticket with the same question, but with a different email to ask about. This one says she needs to take some ***required*** security training. For reference, if you click the link and fail the test, you have to take security training that really drills home the simple mantra:

***DO NOT CLICK LINKS FROM EMAILS YOU DO NOT RECOGNIZE.***

I nicely confirm it is a legitimate email with a link to security training, (I know I know, the irony of requiring links to be clicked to be yelled at for clicking links is not lost on me but no one listened to me when I pointed it out), and kick myself for believing her that she didn't click anything. I forgot Rule 0 and for that I suffer. Which leads me to the following exchange:

**$user:**  I attempted to login and submitted a request to do so and never received an email.

(I  click the link in the email she received, click reset password, and then entered her email and confirmed with our mail filter that it accepted the reset password instructions email)  

**$me:** Did you receive one now with password reset instructions?

Weekend passes, I assume she did the thing that she was asking for when I sent it and just forgot to let me know, it happens. Monday arrives...she replies to the above email.

**$user:**  I did but after I left for the day so it has expired. Please send again and let me know when you do. Thanks.

I repeated the above steps, which are fully in her power to do, but hey it takes 2 seconds to do so I don't mind. I also confirmed for the second time that the email WAS delivered and even made a note of the time.

**$me:**  I went through your link and hit password reset again, so it should send something to you! 

**$user:**  $me, It is asking for a password.  I do not have one. I hit “reset password” but I am not receiving any emails.

**$me:**  Odd, it says it was delivered at 9:06. Can I hop in and hunt for the email? (Insert screenshot from mail filter CONFIRMING the exact moment it was delivered.)

Half an hour passes...

**$user:**  I was on the telephone. Yes, please hop in.

Like the diligent little IT slave I am I hop into her PC and pull up her inbox, and wouldn't you know it the VERY FIRST EMAIL AT THE TOP OF HER MAILBOX is an email that literally reads in all caps:

***PASSWORD RESET INSTRUCTIONS***

I open the email, click the link, which of course takes me to a screen for the password to be reset. I hop out of her computer, send:

**$me:**  Looked like the email was right there on top, you should be able to setup a new password here 

and then promptly afterwards my brain shut down. Sometimes I just need to turn off and on again. Today is not a good Monday and I hate it here.

Final Notes: this was an easy ticket overall. Not a single piece of brainpower was used to resolve this ""issue"". If all my tickets were this easy I'd have the best job in the world. However it seems my $users insist on making my job more difficult than it should be.",1,1634566655

A friend's computer was running slowly. This was back in the 90s and back then, I was fairly comfortable with Windows. Registry hacks, finding conflicting DLLs, looking for dodgy software, and so on. I wasn't really particularly good at it, but it's better than someone who knows nothing about them.

So I'm poking about on his computer and there was nothing unusual. I defragged his hard drive (blew his mind), cleared some caches, removed a bunch of software he didn't know he had, etc. 
I asked if it was OK to delete his browser cache. Back then, browser caches could really slow things down and clearing the cache helped a lot.

I opened up IE and in poking about, we discovered that he had a _very_ interesting browser history. Seems his son used the same computer. We discovered (I'll be delicate to avoid being NSFW):

* His son liked girls
* His son, um, was very interested in the ""back door""
* His son was particularly interested in finding out if he could cure a particular STD without seeing a doctor

It was an awkward moment.

A few days later, my friend visited and said he had a long talk with his son. His son ""swears"" he was a good boy but fell asleep at a party and woke up to find a girl pleasuring him with her mouth. Of course, he pushed her away, but that _must_ be how he contacted that STD.

They went to a doctor who just nodded along and prescribed antibiotics without saying a word.",1,1634482884

1719,The wonders of wireless input devices,"While this sub originally brought me to Reddit, I so far never considered to post any of my stories. Well, I guess it is time to change this!

When this happened I was a student tech support in one of the university buildings, doing all the small support things such as installations, getting updates to run, and taking care of issues.

One of the secretaries called that her mouse and keyboard were acting up. I promised I would be right over and, on my way there, was already less than happy as this woman was not exactly the epitome of friendly behaviour.

I got in, smiling, and asked her to show me the problem. Sure enough, her keyboard and mouse acted erratically, only accepting some of the inputs. Well, lucky for me she also kept a few spare parts and I could pick a wired mouse and go to work. The mouse and keyboard were both unify technologies. Those require a special drivers and software. So I deleted it and reinstalled both. Nope.

As I did so the secretary stood beside me, already visibly annoyed that I dated to take a few minutes and complaining of couldn't be this because if worked yesterday. It did not matter that it explained that sometimes even computer systems do develop errors.

As my previous attempt had gone fruitless I dived to see if the USB connector/dongle was either damaged or not seated properly. To my surprise, there wer two of them, above each other. I turned to inquire if she always had had the mouse and keyboard. She told me she had had a wired keyboard until shortly, but because the wireless mouse worked so well, she had asked to be given a wireless keyboard. 

I got up and explained to her that most likely the issue was created because the system only expected one USB connector and the messages were getting garbled up.

Looking straight into my eye she told me:

""no that is not possible.""

I blinked, visibly irritated ""Excuse me?""

""It's not possible. It worked like this since I had the keyboard. it must be something else. Look for something else.""

I smiled a little, forced smile ""I'm certain this is causing the problem. I'll just remove one connector, you can store it as a spare.""

""No that's not possible. Look for something else!""

I sighed and took a step back ""You called *me* as the tech support, because you did not know how to solve the problem. These systems are created so only one usb connector is needed. I'm certain this is causing the issue, thus this is my next step to try and resolve it. Either you let me try this, and if the issue persists I will look for another solution, or I'm happy to let you solve your issue, as I cannot provide you with any more assistance.""

She was not happy. But she grumbled something about letting me try, but she'd dare me to find a solution once that failed. Then she walked into the adjacent coffee kitchen.

I dove under the desk again, pulled one of the connectors, ran the connecting/calibration once more and tested the keyboard and mouse. Both worked as expected. She was still making coffee, so I rolled up and put back the wired mouse and set the wireless connector into one of the old packages before saying goodbye.

A minute after arriving back at my desk I get a steaming, nearly screaming CA from her that I couldn't just steal her wired equipment. With an annoyed, but calm tone I informed er I had put it back to here I had taken it from. She muttered ""Oh."" And hung up.

1720,Let's relocate our entire IT department to a new city. Tech support will not be relocated ....,"The company in question no longer exists (and you'll understand why), but nonetheless, I will respect the rules and not name them. This isn't a single tale, but a series of small tales about how one company badly screwed up their relocation.

I had started a new job at a senior software engineer at an ISP after it had been bought by someone who liked to buy companies, kill the unprofitable parts, and immediately resell the rest at a premium since it looked profitable.

I'm sitting in the office one day when there's an emergency ""all hands"" meeting and someone stood up and gave a presentation about how they were shutting down our offices. We all had to move to a business park in a major city three hours away.

All software developers would have their relocation costs covered, but anyone else had to pay their own way. If you didn't relocate, you didn't have a job. The man asked if there were any questions. The very first question was, ""who are you?""

Seems it was our CEO. No one actually knew him and he hadn't bothered to introduce himself.

I immediately volunteered for the relocation committee and in that committee, I gave a presentation about sociologist William Whyte and [a study he did](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2003/03/28/20030328/):

&gt; Virtually all corporate relocations involve a move to a location which is closer to the CEO’s home than the old location. Whyte discovered this principle after an extensive study of Fortune 500 companies that left New York City for the suburbs in the 1950s and 1960s. They always had big, complicated Relocation Committees which carefully studied all the options and chose, coincidentally I’m sure, to move to within half a mile of the CEO’s home in Danbury, Connecticut. Whyte also showed that these companies all tanked after the relocation.

The reason are obvious: with a huge relocation, you lose a lot of staff with detailed business knowledge and the new staff repeat mistakes the old staff knew not to do.

The company relented and agreed they'd pay for relocation for the accounting team, but tech support? They're a dime a dozen. We'll replace anyone who doesn't move.

Big mistake.

We relocate and immediately it becomes clear there's a problem. The CEO stopped by and asked me what I thought about the business park and I replied ""we're well outside the city. People who want to live in X can't easily commute here. People who don't want to live in X won't want to work in a soulless business park close to a city they hate."" I realized this was a bad thing to say and apologized. The next day I came into work and there was a very nice bottle of single malt whisky sitting on my desk. It was a gift from the CEO for being honest.

That aside, we started having issues because we had very few tech support people relocate, so we temporarily retained the call center in the former city. Now we had to find tech support. Sure enough, no one wanted to work at this business park. Eventually, we found someone who ran a cable TV support center. We were an ISP. He knew _nothing_ about technology, but  otherwise, he had a solid background.

So he was hired and immediately found that he couldn't hire experienced tech support people to work in this business park. No problem! We'll hire _anyone_ who has passion for something. They'll learn on the job. How do you identify if they have passion for something?

All candidates were given colored pencils and told to draw something they were passionate about. Some candidates just walked out. Those who remained had no tech skills, but drew pretty pictures.

The inevitable support calls came in.

""Why can't I FTP anything to my server?""

""How do I set up DNS?""

""What's HTML?""

It was a disaster and things were going poorly. However, we had our accounting team. Many of them had been with the company for years and could answer those basic questions. So for a while, tech support staff were answering basic billing questions and forwarding tech support calls to accounting.

Eventually, accounting revolted and that got stopped.

But the calls didn't. The calls kept coming, and coming, and coming.

A third-level support person who stayed with us came up with an idea. Most questions were simple. So he created a FAQ as an image. He emailed it to all tech support staff and told them to set this as their desktop background and when calls came in, minimize their windows and look for a question matching what the customer was asking.

None of the tech support staff knew how to set a background image so he had to go around and do this for all of them, and show them how to minimize their windows.

So far, so bad. Things are going poorly and tech support is flooded with angry customers, call wait times were increasing, and morale was in the toilet.

And then it got better. Calls slowed down to a trickle, tech support could handle the load, and at a company party, the tech support manager got an award for his great job in reducing the number of calls to tech support. Seems he approved a software package for creating a tech support web site where customers could find their own answers.

Shortly afterwards he got fired for it.

Apparently, this web site required us to pay _for every damned click_. And the tech support manager had ordered developers to bury our tech support phone number deep within the site. Customers were clicking like mad trying to find that number, and we were getting charged for every click.",1,1634470149

It’s nearing the end of the day and I’m counting down the minutes until the weekend is here.

Behind me I hear a voice but can’t make out who it is because of my earbud in one ear.

It’s the new guy and he walks right up to my desk. My back faces the entry way of the office which I absolutely hate for this reason.

He stands there beside me, like a foot away, and points at the computer on my desk and says, “Can I take the Logitech thing out of the front of my computer?” His arm still is raised pointing at my computer as he stops talking.

“Uh…what Logitech thing?” I turn around and look at my computer because I have nothing Logitech and then look at his arm in front of my face just over my desk.

Then it dawns on me. He got a computer with a wireless mouse and the Logitech dongle sits in the front USB port.

“…no? That’s for your mouse. Your wireless mouse.”

You can see the blank look on his face as he stares at me. The train is arriving into the station. The light is finally on after hitting the light switch.

“Ohhhh..” he says as he finally puts down his arm.

“Yeah, cause it’s not Bluetooth.” I say as he walks back to his desk, I presume.

Not sure why it bothered him, but alright.",1,1634352780

The ticket has some of the nessecary info, mainly that the IQ app (the MDM one) doesn't allow them to log in stating that the pin code is incorrect.

Well I can't do anything with these phones, so I bump the ticket to the supplier and they quickly respond (I mean these guys are really quick) if we can turn the phone on so they can log in remotely and see what's what.

   I have to install approximately 10 new network cables in my room, 3 new in the laundry room/office, and re-run the living room. I have a lot of wired network devices plus I am changing the wi-fi to a mesh wi-fi. Also we will have two different networks with one carrying all the home automation and cameras. The other will be for entertainment, internet, and printing. I've had to buy all the items needed over the last three days.

   So today I went to Home depot to get everything that I needed. Keystones, punchdown blocks, A camera, smart plugs, etc.. I get everything and head back to the hospital  as today is chemo day for her. I pick her up, she is tired but OK. 

Mom:  What did you do this afternoon? 

Me:  Went to Home Depot and got the rest of what I needed to change the network cabling. 

Mom:  I better have internet when you get done. 

Me:  You'll have internet. In fact it will be much faster than what you have now. 

Mom:  I don't want it any faster.

Mom:  When you went to the hospital to have surgery. (So 3 weeks ago, mind you that she has had this tablet for SIX YEARS)

Me:  Well charge it.

Mom:  Your internet broke it. 

Me:  No it didn't, I haven't done anything yet. 

Mom:  Also, my phone is broken too. I can't send a text.

 Tablet was at 1% battery. It is 6 years old so she needs a new one soon.

Mom:  You need to change the wi-fi password.   

Me:  Why?

Mom:  The guy on tv said I should.

Mom:  I like the password now.

$gem = This User

$me= Me

# In which he needs to press a button

One fine afternoon I was finishing up work and preparing to leave, when this user called me with an issue. I don't recall the specifics of the issue, but it was something on his cellphone. During the course of troubleshooting, I told him to go to the home screen of his phone...

$gem: ""How do I do that?""  
$me: *sighs*. ""At the bottom of your phone there are three buttons. Press the middle one.""  
*long pause*  
$gem: ""There aren't any buttons at the bottom of my phone.""  
$me: ""On the phone itself. Not on-screen. There are three physical buttons.""  
$gem: ""No... There are no buttons.""

Now, we deploy the same phones to all of our users. I know what phone he has, and I know for a fact that there is a back button, home button, and menu button. I insist that yes, there are three buttons at the bottom of his phone. He insists that there are not. Finally, frustrated, I tell him to describe to me what he sees.

$gem: ""Umm I see a charging port... Speakers...""

# In which I need to work on his phone

More recently, $gem contacted me saying that he was unable to open an Excel spreadsheet on his phone. I stepped him through several troubleshooting steps, and got it fixed. The next day, I receive a text from him. ""For some reason it's doing the same thing again?"" Via text, I walk him through trying the same troubleshooting steps. This time it does not fix it. After a full reinstall of Excel still fails to fix it, I tell him that I will need to see it in person.

$me: ""OK, I will have too see it then to figure out what is going on.""  
$gem: ""OK.""

*A day passes.*

$gem: ""IT'S STILL NOT WORKING!!!!!! Did you figure anything out????""  
$me: ""As I said, I will need to see it in person so I can dig into it and figure out what is going on.""  
$gem: ""OK.""

*6 hours pass. I receive a phone call from $gem.*

$gem: ""Yeah so did you figure anything out as far as this spreadsheet?""",1,1634142135
1750,Escalation: The folder name is too long!!,"For context and to understand what this is about, you have to understand the limitations of NTFS and Windows folder-sharing:

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NTFS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NTFS)

=&gt; the maximum allowable filename length on NTFS is 255 characters! (this limitation was only recently removed with Windows 10, but chances are that older Windows server OS releases still have it ...)

That includes folder names and network share names. So if you had a file like e.g. `C:\Folder\Filename.Ext`  ... that's fine.

If you construct something like: `S:\MyShare\&lt;... some super long complex path here ...&gt;\&lt;... more complex folder structure here ...&gt;\Totally_very_long_unnecessary_long_super-duper_filename_here.ext` ... then you will run into the *""File name too long!""* error.

So there I was keeping an eye on the support ticket pool when this ticket comes in:

***Title: ""Folder name is too long !""***

Other information in the ticket:  
***Priority: Urgent***  
***Multiple users affected: Yes***

**But:** it neither tells me **WHICH FOLDER** or **WHO** the users are that are affected (e.g. so I could maybe call them and ask them which folder was giving them troubles? Nope ...)

Ugh. Facedesk.

**How in the world can you forget to add this super crucial piece of information??**

And the person who forwarded the ticket into my pool (... and thus might maybe know more? ...) already went home and isn't reachable anymore. Just great. Fantastic timing...  sigh.

So I take the ticket, no matter what. I figure sooner or later the ticket will run into a timeout (since it was marked as *""Urgent""* ...) and someone who had anything to do with the creation of this ticket might call me then?

Yes, good plan. Apart from trying my luck with Crystall Balls and Tarot cards this is about the only thing I can do at this point. 

I have like a few 10'000 users and probably several 100'000 folders and millions of files on our storage systems. There's no way I can ever find out which users and which folder the ticket is talking about if they don't tell me ...  Even if I created a script that scanned all the storage systems for files with long names it would probably take ages to hit the right files in the right folder. It would be SO SO MUCH faster if they simply told me ...  sigh.

**But nope. Let's just create a ticket that will auto-escalate and let's not tell the support guy which folder or which user is affected. Forcing support people to search for needles in haystacks is so much fun... (pro tip:  NO IT'S NOT)**

And indeed, various timeouts start going off. About 15 minutes after I took the ticket, the ticketing system sends me messages like:

***Your action is required. If you do not act upon Support Request &lt;Ticket number&gt; this ticket may be escalated.***

Fantastic!  This is exactly what I want. Hopefully then someone will give me the stupid information I need.

So the warnings repeat a few times when after about 1 hour I see the ticket has indeed escalated and now it is assigned to one of the escalation managers on the customer side ...

My hope was since this escalation manager person is from the same customer he might know which folder and which users are affected? Or at least it might be a lot easier for them to find out ...?

Yes, I am naive, LOL :)

This was the moment when I notice that my new best friend Mr. Escalation Manager has changed the title of the ticket.

New title:  ***""THE FOLDER NAME IS TOO LONG !!!!!!!!!""***

***Priority: Escalation***  
***Multiple users affected: Yes***

Cool. All these big capital letters and all those exclamation marks will totally help me resolve the issue (pro tip: NO THEY WILL NOT ...).  Facepalm.

And then my phone rings. I can see on the display that Mr. Escalation Manager is calling me ...

*""Hello! Mr. Poor Support Guy speaking, how may I help you ... ""*

*""Duuuude, what's going on over there?  I know you did see the support ticket, so why the hell is it taking so long ...?""*

*""Well... the ticket is missing all relevant information, there is nothing I can do ... ""*

Mr. Escalation Manager screams into the phone: *""WHAAAAT!?? The error message is right there!! Let me read it for you: The folder name is too long!!  You can read, right? ...""*

*""Yes ...""*

Mr. Escalation Manager screams even louder:  ***""THE F\*KN FOLDER NAME IS TOO LONG!!!!!!!""***

*""Yes...  And now if you could use your energy and tell me* ***WHICH*** *folder exactly, that'd be great ....""*

*""Ugh ....""*   **\*crickets\***

*""Ahem ... It doesn't say which folder ...?""*

*""Nope""*

Mr. Escalation Manager is very very silent all of a sudden.

*""Can you at least tell me which of your users are affected? So I could maybe ask them which folder is giving them trouble ...?""*

*""Ugh.  It doesn't say which users are affected? ...""*

*""Nope""*

*""Ahemmm.... well ... ugh. I will try and find out and call you back.* ***Tomorrow.****""*

Oh I see.  *""Priority: Urgent""* indeed, huh?

The next morning I can see that the title of the ticket was edited again:

***Title: ""The Folder name is too long""***

***Priority: Low***

Whoa!! What happened to all those capital letters and all those oh so ever ""helpful"" exclamation marks that underlined the importance of the issue??  Gone! :)

It turned out that only one single user was affected. And solving this only took like 5 minutes and I could have done this without all the drama if only they had bothered to give me crucial information right from the beginning.

1751,Let me just check the flux capacitor," I'm a full stack web dev, mostly working on developing and maintaining eCommerce sites using my company's in-house platform. We do support and maintenance as well as new sites and features, but aren't expected to support end users directly. However we occasionally (or in the case of the site that features in this story, not so rarely) get end user issues forwarded to us if the client's helpdesk can't fix it or just don't feel like doing their jobs today.

This story features the same healthcare-adjacent eCommerce site as [my previous tale](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/pepaox/a_case_of_impeccable_timing/). Our client contact got in touch in a panic:

&gt;$client: URGENT account help please look at this urgently!!  
&gt;  
&gt;$manager: Hey $me, can you look into this?  
&gt;  
&gt;$client: I have no idea what's happened, $customer only signed up on Monday but has been getting text notifications about an order he didn't place since Saturday!

Yes, our site is malfunctioning and sending spurious notifications *back in time* to *before we had this customer's contact details*.

Or maybe, it's not anything to do with *his* account at all? I knew what had happened as soon as I read the email - it's the same reason I semi-regularly get texts for a Ms James about her supermarket order...

Seems like a bit of a coincidence that some other customer would make a typo in their mobile number that was not only another valid mobile number, but another customer of this site - but of course, it wasn't another customer's mobile at the time, and probably the recipient of the texts signed up in an attempt to get them to stop.

To be fair to the client contact, they could reasonably have wanted help identifying the account that mistakenly had $customer's mobile number, since our CMS doesn't have a function to search by phone number. Instead, I fired up my database client and confirmed that this was the case, pulled out the ID of the offender, and provided idiot-resistant instructions to resolve the issue.

We also recommended to $client that they have us update the text message templates to greet the customer by first name, to make any such issues in the future more apparent. So it was far from a useless request.

But I can't help but laugh at the panicked report that $customer's account was malfunctioning *since before it existed*.",1,1634115933

&gt;**Me:** I’ll try and figure out if I can swap it for a less used one somewhere else. Sadly I don’t have any of that model lying around at the moment

&gt;**User:** My projector has stopped working altogether

&gt;**Me:** Altogether? Is there any lights on it?

&gt;**User:** Yes but makes an awful noise and goes onto standby

&gt;**Me:** Which lights are they?

I think I can nick one from another room where it’s never used, so I’ll try and do a swap in a minute

&gt;**User:** Blue and orange ones",1,1634039141

1761,The time I was called in to stop an 11 year old genius.,"This one is going to be a little different from most of what I have seen on this sub. Whereas most posts here involve rampant stupidity, this one involves genius. A couple had seen my flyers I had posted, still in 2007 working for myself, as a pc technician. They called me and told me their daughter (11) kept bypassing their parental software and going online. They asked me to take a look and see what I could do.

So I go in, look at their xp setup, and of course, the software is garbage. I test it out, and am able to kill it via the device manager. So I go online, look for a better one and install it. I see the kid peeking from around a corner just... smirking. I know she's done something. I open the new software, everything seems fine. It was something like netware nanny or something, I can't remember the name. Basically, it blocked any attempt to open non-whitelisted websites.

Still, that smug look made me more curious. I looked around the programs folder, nothing stood out. Checked running processes, everything ok. Looked in the service list, fine. Ok, time for a reboot.

As the computer reboots, I notice something. For a brief second it said that the first boot device was disabled and loaded the secondary. Since I had been hired to investigate, I did so. I rebooted again and loaded the bios menu. There was a second hard drive listed in the bios as primary. I booted it up and it brought me to a very familiar linux screen I had been using at the time at home.

She had somehow managed to install a second hard drive, hide it in windows, load it with linux and hide all of this from her parents. I was incredibly impressed. I wrote a short note to her, because I knew she would figure out a way past what I was about to do eventually. I then went into the bios and locked it with the linux boot device disabled. I thought about giving her up and handing her parents the hard drive. But I just couldn't.

I wrote down the password to the bios, handed it to them and told them I had locked the bios so it couldn't be changed without the password. I still wonder how long it took her to find that slip of paper and get back online.",1,1633992155

1763,"The tale of when things go from simple emergency to ""Oh My God! Get someone on this thing now! The CEO is standing there in the store with the CIO and CFO and nothing's working!""","So context. I work on a contract for Autozone Tech Support. Mostly store and employees, not customers. So I mostly handle making the tickets and sending them to someone who can do the job. Or, if possible, doing it myself like replacement orders or data file work with the supervisor. That's mostly what I do.

However, this one call I get, I say the lines the company wants me to say, fill out the info, and hear this:

CA = Caller

Primus = Me

CA: Yeah, so the entire line of registers can't open their cash drawers so can't make much in sales.

Primus: Okay, give me a second - *Me filling out ticket information in a bored fashion*

CA: And I got the CEO standing here along with the rest.

Primus: *Thinking ""What did she say?""* I'm sorry. Did you say CEO?

CA: (laughing to hide anxiety from her most powerful boss right in front of her with 11 other high-ranking people) Yes. So you can imagine this is a bigger problem than you think it is.

Thank god for the lady being nice and trying to joke about it. I mean, I wouldn't curse out tech support if the big boss was standing right there, possibly checking out the place and seeing how it's going. So...there I go informing the tech group in Teams about this. My supervisor, thinking it's just a normal cash drawer not opening on all drawers, told me to send it to the emergency line. Yeah, you can guess what I told him next.

Needless to say, he dropped everything he was doing and went about getting someone very good at their job to do this ticket. Obviously, no chances are being taken. I mean, the moment I mentioned the CEO, CIO, and CFO was in the house, I imagine the tech group team that handles high-ranking problems went into overdrive to quickly fix this. It was all allocated within one minute in fact.

The problem...the switching hub where everything connects to was disconnected. So yeah. That sent everyone into a panic and numerous times told where I got constant updates until it was handed off. The thing that was most crazy, my name was taken off as the maker of the ticket, and the person who took over placed theirs. Even though the system always places the initial person who made the ticket onto the entry as like first and chosen choice. Guess they didn't want like no low-ranking person to have their name attached to this.",1,1633989275
1764,Working with a tech who swears in his native Finnish is hilarious but also wholesome,"So I stated in another post on this sub that I work for an international robotics company, specifically in our Service department. We are responsible for any hardware issues that arise and go to local sites to fix stuff or source techs to go to sites out of state. I myself am the senior-most person in our department and will soon be replacing my boss since he is retiring this week. 

For the past two months, I've been working the overnight shift all by myself. Help desk is there too of course, but I mainly do everything on my own from getting stuff ready for shipping to working with techs over the phone. Nothing too difficult. Well last night I was on the phone with a tech from a site in Finland. 

Let's call the guy Lars (his middle name actually, we have his full name in our records). He is absolutely the biggest sweetheart you can imagine. Always kind, gentle, upbeat, respectful, etc. Not a bad word you can say about him. So I was on the phone with him for about a half hour and he was doing a relatively easy fix: replacing a front panel/cover on the robot as the original had been cracked after someone hit it with a hospital bed. I say ""relatively easy"" because there are a lot of screws that have to be threaded very carefully and can be tricky to get them to catch and tighten. 

It was just funny hearing him, anytime he strained, swear loudly even when he set the phone down. I tried using translate on my phone and got words like *Vittu*, *Huora* and *Kyrpä*. I'll let y'all look those up lol. I myself had my phone on mute and was laughing up a storm. I especially laughed when he would walk away for a second or two and I'd hear him swearing in the distance. But again, this guy is such a sweetheart and did everything right with regards to fixing it. 

I love just talking to him about his personal life also like his kids that are in college, where he and his wife are going on holiday, etc. Great guy I wish I could meet in person.",1,1633985118

1769,My experience with the cupholder call.,"Back when I was fresh out of college, I worked for myself for a while doing tech support, website building and whatever else I could get. I wasn't strong with networking, but could manage minor installs, run cable etc. So I did pretty ok for myself for a while as a general all around IT guy.

A woman, in her mid 60s, who lived a couple blocks away from me had had me install and build a computer from parts she had bought online at my recommendation. She saved about $150 buying it piecemeal and hiring me to put it together and got a better machine to boot. This was back when purchasing parts online cost 1/2 what a full machine cost.

A few weeks later, she calls me up saying her cup holder had broken. I respond with a confused ""ok?""

She told me I need to fix it because the cup holder was too flimsy and couldn't handle a heavy drink. The drink spilled all over her tower and it was a huge mess. I walk over because it wasn't too far and was a nice day. And I come in to a mess. The rug underneath the tower was soaked. I unplugged the machine and lifted it up and I immediately see the problem. This was 2007 and people still had CD and DVD drives. She had used the CD drive as a cup holder and it had promptly snapped in half. 

It took me a few minutes to explain to her what the cd drive was and that using it as a cupholder was NOT its intended use. Fortunately, she wasn't stupid and was able to accept her mistake. At my recommendation she ordered a new CD drive and paid me both for my time and to install the part when it came. Nice lady. It was a ridiculous problem, but then I don't remember any instruction manual for a computer mentioning that the optic drive WASN'T a cup holder, and it did kind of look like one back in the day.",1,1633907741
1770,Maybe do send a network engineer to do a server admin's job?,"I don't know if it's a rule that you have to say this, but ... LTL FTP.

Characters in this story include:

Me - me, Network Engineer at $MSP

$ServerMSP – Server Admin at $MSP

$ServerClient – Server Admin at $Client

&amp;#x200B;

I work for an MSP. One of our clients has a firewall that also acts as an SSL VPN terminator. My team (networking) manages this firewall.

My team received a request to add some new VPN groups to the firewall to allow users to access specific servers on specific protocols. The firewall queries AD to get user group memberships.

We set this up and then moved to testing. $ServerClient moved his account out of the IT Staff VPN group, and put it into the newly created group, then logged into the VPN. However, he had more access than the new user group was supposed to get.

When I was told about this, I double checked my firewall &amp; VPN config (all correct) and logs. Sure enough, his VPN session was matching the IT Staff user group, even though he had removed his AD account from that group.

My next thought – ‘Probably nested AD groups.’ I message $ServerMSP and ask him to check if the IT Staff VPN group is nested inside any other groups that $ServerClient is a member of. $ServerMSP checks AD and says no, no nested groups there so that’s not the issue.

I set up a troubleshooting session with $ServerClient and run debugs on the firewall. I can clearly see that when the firewall is querying the AD server for $ServerClient’s AD group memberships, it is reporting that he is a member of both groups (IT Staff and new VPN group). I bring up my same suggestion: ‘probably nested AD groups.’ $ServerClient checks the group in AD and says no, that’s not the issue.

At this point I pass the work on to $ServerMSP and his team. The firewall only does what it’s told, and I can see that it’s being given incorrect information.

A few days later, I receive an email from $ServerClient: “We found the issue! The IT Staff VPN group is nested inside another group that my account is a member of!”",1,1633904511

In the northern part of the Netherlands there were two offices connected to each other via a pair of rooftop dishes. The simple kind of connection, less than 1 km apart.  

The client complained frequently that the remote office would be unable for several minutes at various times throughout the week. Each time a technician had a look the problem would have disappeared and could not be replicated.  

After a few months of trying different things all hardware bits had been replaced one technician came up with a diagnostic plan. The plan in question? Take a lawnchair to the roof and sit next to the dish on one of the roofs and look at the other dish.  

It took several hours but then it happened: about halfway a bridge in one of the canals opened to let a boat pass.  

The fix was easy: move both dishes to the side a bit so the bridge was no longer in line of sight.",1,1633865552

1791,A little old school knowledge helps solve a months old issue,"TL;DR Special characters in filename wasn't caught for months.

Started working for an MSP a few years ago and early on during a shadow session, the primary tech for the client ask me to look into an issue that had baffled them for months. We are onsite and addressing some issues, and found some idle time. While he was working on a system reimage, I looked into why schedule reports in a software package was not creating reports.

I got to work familiarizing myself with the software, and what it did. Then look into the reporting problem. All settings looked normal, nothing stood out. Try to run the schedule report now, and it would stop with a vague error message. I'm thinking, well I have  an error message so time to call the vendor and get the meaning behind it. I got connected to a very pleasant tech who went through the usual steps to check the basics, etc. Then moved on to more advance troubleshooting. The vendor tech start running logs and we checked for messages. The error came up after the logs show unable to create the file for the report. Great still more vague info, but at least its a step in the right direction.

I was thinking it could be a storage issue, but this was on a server used by multiple people and I decided to dismiss it since nobody else had issues creating files. I was staring at the filename used to create the report, when I realized the root cause was staring me back in the face. The filename used a $ in it and I remembered there are limitation on file naming under NTFS and older storage formats.  I simplified the filename removing any special characters and the report ran successfully. 

The vendor tech was on a remote session and was watching me and was also surprised. I asked them to send an enhancement request to add checking to the report section to disallow special characters, to avoid this for their other customers as well.",1,1633649542

I fetched a new chair and a yardstick and poked at the towels, which held an HP laptop, the best we deploy, shiny, bright, and brand new. And waterlogged. 

About this time, $SeniorDirector appears and beams at me. He knows I can save the day. It seems that the owner/operator of this laptop, the previously aforementioned $Director from before, decided to take a video call from the balcony overlooking his pool so he could keep an eye on his kids' friends who had come over to swim. Picture the scene, he says, the sun is shining, the breeze is cool, and right next to the laptop on the little glass table there's a fancy drink with an umbrella and a lemon slice in it.

1793,The Infamous Text Field Rabbit Hole,"This is the tale of technical simplicity and corporate politics.

Part 1: intro

So it was my first week on the job. Nobody had any clue what I was supposed to do, neither did I. You see, there wasn't a support department before me, so I was alone in a dangerous world.

Anyway I get myself into the OPs department, introduce myself to the manager and ask him to show me around.
She introduces me to a long time ops employee that worked pretty much on all projects (around 150 of them).
 
""Hi, how are you?"" - I say colloquially.

*He understands ""Hi, what are you doing"" and replies ""well, I'll be happy to show you""

I instantly sit down and get bombarded with the horrible UI and text fields of the operations interface.

""This field is already filled, we don't change that, the other field needs to be filled with a date [...]"" - you get the point.

After one hour he says ""done"" and opens a large notebook on his desk, and starts writing down the project name, fields, forms, starting codes, end hour.

""Do you mind if I ask what are you writing down""

""Oh, no problem, it's all work related, I write down everything I do in a workday, all projects, all issues, any relevant information. I have 5 notebooks full from this month alone""
(Operators had no personal account or computer, they were using virtual boxes with the interface only)

""Oh, okay ... Will you be willing to show me an issue that you encounter frequently?""

""Sure! As a matter of fact I am scheduled to work on that project right now."" *Opens up another interface and brings in the first file. ""You see, the first 3 fields must be always correct, for a beginner to fill them out wrong he's fired on the spot, the next 4 fields must be filled out correctly, and you might get a reprimand for mistakes"". Now, number 8!""

As he pauses I ask ""what about field number 8?""

""I don't believe field number 8 is of any importance actually, but it's grouped together with the high priority fields."" 
""It's sometimes autocompleted by the system, with info that should go in other fields""

""Okay""

""Some supervisers ask for it to be left empty, or with whatever info is autocompleted in them""

""Okay, so nobody ...""

""Well, look, I have the manual for the project, and field number 8 is actually number 9, look at what it's supposed to contain."" ""Some supervisers ask for field 8 and 9 to be the same.""

""Okay, so there is a worka...""

""No, no, that's not it, when we get return errors on the other fields, almost everyone stumbles into field 8, and we get reprimanded for being late and breaching SLA's""...""I know that the error is in another field, I never check 8""...""the supervisors rely on me to do the error checks for this project""

""Wow"" *there's 120 stations on 30 rows in the hall ""nobody else does errors for this project?"" 

""No, no, they do, but they never finish in time, they always get stuck on what to fill in field 8.""


Part 2: field 8

I pick up my laptop, get my newly minted credentials, hop on the provided virtual machine which is a monster containing all of the projects databases.
The entirety of the afternoon is spent looking for and at the project structure.

Next day I begin anew, I look into the reports and the project manual fits perfectly with the automated report system.
The main table does however contain an extra column filled with all types of data, but mostly empty fields ('').

I send an email to the developer listed on the project and ask him about field 8. He replies immediately saying that field 8 was implemented and working in the test environment.

Ok, dead end.

 I need to look at the code: several days later I get access to the source codes. 
Every project has a number in the front, no idea what the number means, searching returns 3 hits, no possibility to narrow down. 
I have to check 3 entire projects with the same keyword in order to find the elusive field 8.

Finally, I find it, it's in the code, but the try catch on it is very lax, and part of it is commented out so basically:

-if it finds the relevant info, it will autocomplete the field
-it can take strings
-it's a non essential field
-it's marked as important
-it's linked to the gibberish column that I discovered earlier.

I copy the class over and add a comment in it(since I wasn't allowed to edit project files) 
-turn off visibility for the field
-return value 1 to column until there is a new version of the project.

I document everything, send it to the Devs, project management, and ops. Job done. Go home

Part 3. Impact

Next day my e-mail has 7 replies. 
The Devs won't budge ""it's an important field"".
Project management "" we won't allow the change""
Operations ""impact is due to lack of user training""

Customer care ""the client is very unhappy with breached SLA's. This is the only project without major issues that is in the top5 customer complaints. Please fix the issue""

3 against, 3 don't care, 1 pro. Most people will find other stuff to play with, or maybe grab a coffee.

 But not me, you see, I can feel when a problem is so annoying, and so damaging that people will blame literally everything else but the problem.
Instead of grabbing a coffee I just went back to operations, in the soul crushing hall, where the little people were suffering because of field number 8.
 I went in to the supervisors office, planted myself in the middle of them and asked for a complete impact report and all error breaches, all documented corrections ever done on this project.
They looked at me and said ""sure, would you like fries with that?""

""Fuck"" I muttered. ""You don't have any of those""

""Look at this place, even if someone would ask us to do them, we would never have enough time for such reports""

""Fine, I'll do it myself, let me know when you get tto he error corrections and I'll drive over from the main office.""

One month later I got the impact report.

Field 8 was turning a 30 minute task into a 24 hour ordeal for 3 shifts.

Money wise the project was costing more in penalties due to breached SLA's than it earned.

All supervisors and operators assigned to the project lost their performance bonuses. 
This caused them to ping pong the project around so each would lose 1 month of bonus out of 6 months.

In short, people were simply taking turns getting f***ed in the ... by field number 8. And the company was losing money over it, a lot of money.


Part 4. Money and politics


I hit 'reply to all' and attach my new discoveries to the e-mail.

First replies coming in. 
Dev team. ""Field 8 is working fine""
Project management ""field 8 is essential to the project""
Everyone else wants it removed.

I get my coffee, wait for the lunch break and go in the project management office. 
8 desks, one person.

""Hi, I'm the new guy from support""

""Hello, can I help you?"" She replies

""Yeah, I'm looking for whoever was in charge of project X -number code"", ""btw what do those number codes stand for?""

*She srugs while opening some files

""Ah, it's a long time client, this is one of the newer projects from them, it belongs to colleague X, she will know more""

""Is there a documentation that I might have?""

""Why, is there a problem?"" 

""Is there now? I wouldn't know. I like the name of this project, can you just send me the specs, nothing special, just the main outlines?""

""I have here some versions, I can't figure out which is the final one, I'll just send them all over. Have fun!""

""I will, I promise, thanks btw, nice meeting you.""

Now the final piece of the puzzle. She had sent me a gold mine of info for that project. For the sake of sanity I will explain quickly:

Project X was requested 11 months prior, took 1 month from design to enter production and went through 4 versions.
First version was very similar to the one in actual production.
Second version was expanded to include more types of files (basically a double project)
Third version was a scale down of second version and the infamous field number 8 was added as mandatory.

Drumroll:
Version 4 expanded the scope again and only 20% of project files had info for field number 8.

During testing the customer requested the REMOVAL OF FIELD NUMBER 8 info from reports since 80% of it was not there in the first place.

Field number 8 was PAID FOR EXTRA and MORE since it came in lat at v3.
Since customer asked for removal of field 8 info from REPORTS and did not SPECIFY removal from code, it was left in production because it was PAID FOR.

9 months in production, huge amounts of money down the drain and finally the mistery was revealed: project management did not want to refund the customer due to technicalities and Devs would not change the file because they never received the request.

Finally I got a meeting with the heads of each department, pointed out the issue and how to solve it and field number 8 was removed.

1796,Printer problems follow her!,"3 stories about one woman, and how every printer she has breaks.

    Cast:
    $C = that woman
    $Tech = our technician (employed by us)
    $Me = u/texas_technician
    $B = the boss of each establishment

# Story #1:  This POS copier keeps jamming.

$Tech gets a call about a copier jamming.  Goes on site, and asks $B where the jams are happening at.

&gt;$B:  ""Well, the person who reported the jamming is out to lunch.  But she said its coming from the top part of the printer.""  
&gt;  
&gt;$Tech:  ""No worries.  I'll run it and get a few jams, and fix the problem.""  
&gt;  
&gt;$B:  ""Thank you ~~$Tech's First Name~~ (*the boss has known $Tech for ages).*

$Tech proceeds to test the copier.  Finds no faults and then charges half price for the call.  Tells $B to call if the problem happens again, because they couldn't get it to happen.

**CALLBACK:**

&gt;$B:  ""The copier is jamming again.  Same problem.""  
&gt;  
&gt;$Tech:  ""Ok I'll be out there later today to fix it.""

$Tech does the same routine again.  Finds no faults.  And decides not to charge for the service call #2.""  $B was shown that the copier was functioning normally.

**CALLBACK #2:**

&gt;$C:  ""This copier is still jamming!""  
&gt;  
&gt;$Tech:  ""Oh ok, I'll be out later today to/  
&gt;  
&gt;$C:  ""No, I need you here now.  You've been here twice and haven't fixed the problem.""  
&gt;  
&gt;$Tech:  ""How long will you be on site?""  
&gt;  
&gt;$C:  ""Twenty minutes.""  
&gt;  
&gt;$Tech:  ""I'll be there in five.""  (small town fyi).

$Tech gets on site and goes straight to the copier and runs it.  Zero problems.  $B comes out, and is visibly irritated that $Tech has been here twice and not fixed the problem.

&gt;$Tech:  I cannot get this thing to jam!  Does it jam for you?  
&gt;  
&gt;$B:  I never use the damn thing.  $C is the one who has the problem.  
&gt;  
&gt;$Tech:  May I talk to $C.  
&gt;  
&gt;$B:  She left right after you talked to her.  
&gt;  
&gt;$Tech:  When she gets back tell her to call me please.  I need her to run the machine, so I can see what is happening when she uses it.  
&gt;  
&gt;$B:  I don't see how that will help, but I guess I can/  
&gt;  
&gt;$B:  Oh wait she just pulled up.  Hey $C can you come here a minute.  Run this copy for me.

$C approaches the copier and is visibly  irritated, while maddogging $Tech.  $C puts the paper in the automatic document feed and presses start.  KABOOM instant jam.

$Tech takes the same set of documents.  Runs them.  No jam.

&gt;$B:  What the heck?  
&gt;  
&gt;$C:  This copier is a POS!  
&gt;  
&gt;$Tech:  Hey $C, can you run this set again?  
&gt;  
&gt;$C:  Ugh, fine.

$C places the paper in the document tray.  And proceeds to press start/

&gt;$Tech:  Stop!  
&gt;  
&gt;$C:  What?!  
&gt;  
&gt;$Tech:  Let go of the paper, then press start.

    Explanation:  Now I know what you're thinking.  $C is so dumb that she has been holding the paper preventing it from feeding.  But that is not the case.  $C was holding the ass end of the paper up, while copying.  On the document tray of the copier there are sensor flags.  The flags detect the length of the paper.  The paper being used was LGL sized paper.  Because $C was holding the paper up, it couldn't sense the paper size.  And would jam because the paper was too long.

&gt;$B:  Charge me for every call you've been our here for.  $C, I need to see you in my office.

# Story #2:  This new copier is a POS!

    Background:  This is a new business than the last story and occurred many years later.  The wife of $B (different $B) ordered a replacement copier.  They were using a consumer grade HP MFP for the business.  And wanted an upgrade.  I'm on site setting up the new copier.  And $B's wife is very happy with the new setup.

&gt;$B's Wife:  This thing is wonderful.  Our new bookkeeper is going to love it.  She's been working here for about 2 months and was complaining about the old copier.  
&gt;  
&gt;$ME:  Wonderful.  I've set this up to one-click scan.  Automatically remove blank documents from the scans.  And set you up on our cloud monitoring system.  When your toner is low it will automatically order a new one direct from us.

$C walks in.  Sees new copier.  Watches me explain how to send email.  Turns her nose up.

&gt;$B's Wife:  What do you think $C?  
&gt;  
&gt;$C:  I don't like it.  
&gt;  
&gt;$B's Wife:  How do I print an envelope $ME?  
&gt;  
&gt;$ME:  Simple.  You put the envelope in this tray and then set the tray to be Envelope #10.

**NEXT DAY @ 7:45 AM**

$C calls me.

&gt;$ME:  Hello, how can I help you?  
&gt;  
&gt;$C:  YOUR printer won't work!  
&gt;  
&gt;$ME:  What problem are you having?  
&gt;  
&gt;$C:  It won't let me print a check!  
&gt;  
&gt;$ME:  What tray are you using?  
&gt;  
&gt;$C:  The front one!  
&gt;  
&gt;$ME:  Oh I know what's wrong.  Its a simple setting, I can walk you throug/  
&gt;  
&gt;$C:  NO!  YOU NEED TO COME FIX THIS RIGHT NOW!  
&gt;  
&gt;$ME:  Ma'am it's a simple setting you can change it in less than 1/  
&gt;  
&gt;$C:  NO! THIS PRINTER IS A POS!!!  COME FIX IT!!!  
&gt;  
&gt;$ME:  Ma'am if I have to come on site to change this it will be a minimum charge of $120.  
&gt;  
&gt;$C:  FINE!  Come fix it.

$C hangs up the phone without saying bye.

1 minute later, $B calls me:

&gt;$ME:  Hell/  
&gt;  
&gt;$B:  This is $B from xyz company.  This new copier is broken.  And you are going to charge me to come fix it?!  
&gt;  
&gt;$ME:  Sir the copier is not broken.  It's a simple setting tha/  
&gt;  
&gt;$B:  Meaning you didn't set it up correctly.  When I sell a product I support it to the fullest.  This is unacceptable.  You will come and fix this and I will not be paying for it.  
&gt;  
&gt;$ME:  OK, I'll see you soon.  

1 hour later I show up on site.  Walk through the door.  $B, $C and a few workers are all in the office.  I say ""hello"".  Walk to the copier.  Touch the screen 3 times then tell $C to please print a check.  Check prints without a problem.  I look over at $B and his mouth is open and his eyes are wide (the sudden realization that his secretary is an idiot).  I walk over to $B and say:  ""I need to have a word with you sir.""

&gt;$ME:  How I was spoken to on the phone this morning was unacceptable.  
&gt;  
&gt;$B:  I am so sorry, I was really busy and heard you were going to charge us.  And/  
&gt;  
&gt;$ME:  I wasn't referring to you sir.  Your secretary was incredibly rude.  We generally give advice to customers on how to change simple settings without charging them.  This setting as you saw, was about as difficult as telling a customer how to change their AC from hot to cold (they are an HVAC service company).  I've working in IT for about 10 years, and I have never been treated like how I was treated this morning.  
&gt;  
&gt;$B:  I apologize.  And this will never happen again.  Thank you for coming out.    
&gt;  
&gt;$ME:  No worries.  If you ever have any questions please don't hesitate to call us.

I get back to the office and see $Tech.  

&gt;$ME:  $Tech, you won't believe what I had to deal with this morning.  There's this lady named $C at xyz company.  And this morning she calle/  
&gt;  
&gt;$Tech:  Wait, I know $C.  I've got a story to tell you.  (proceeds to tell me the story from story #1).

&amp;#x200B;

# Story #3:  Oh hi!

This happens about 3 months after story #2.  In a town an hour away from where the last story occurred.  I am pulling up to a bank whose been my customer for about 8 years.  And spot $B in the parking lot.  He waits for me so we can walk in together and chat.  This is the day right after I setup a new copier.  

&gt;$B:  Good to see you yada, yada, yada.  The employees love the new machine.    
&gt;  
&gt;$ME:  Good to hear.  I'm glad.  Here is that toner I forgot yesterday.

&gt;  
&gt;$C:  (recognizes me)  Oh Hi!  
&gt;  
&gt;$ME:  (Internally says, F\*#K!)

    I visit this bank about twice a quarter.  That was the first and last time I saw $C.  I don't think she lasted long.  And thankfully didn't have to deal with her.  You see $B at this location has a background in IT &amp; IT Sec.  I never confirmed.  But have a suspicion that he sused her out pretty fast.",1,1633631408
1797,The pit of despair,"Got reminded of another tale at The Complicated Complex 

Cast:  
$T - myself   
$Floor - working closely with Murphy as an undefined variable

Imagine the network core for the building is 3 racks worth of what used to be a rather expansive raised floor datacenter (multi-thousands of square feet/furlongs/meters) 

One day, I was tasked to swap a fiber jumper and patch in a new VoIP port and find a surprise literally lurking in the shadows as the outer lighting sucked in the cavern anyways. 

It's a bit darker in here than usual, another set of lights must be buggered as I reach for the switch and step into air on what was supposed to be \~2ft off the ground. 

Murphy - Guess what?   
The floor is gone!   
$T - \*screams internally\*

Imagine your standard-issue tech now hanging on the door trying not to die 

Protip - in an emergency, an ada-compliant door handle is strong enough to bear the weight of a tech/slow down the acceleration to not break an ankle. 

Once the initial shock wears off, I climb down into the pit, hop up to the platform now surrounding just the network racks and finish the patch. 

Told the bossman and sent the maintenance team a strongly worded email that they need to put up notice and signs about works being done in the datacenter. 

$Maint replies: Oh yeah, we sold the flooring for scrap... 

\*record scratch\*    
Wait... WHAT?     
You made a safety hazard for money?

1803,"""Our new offices are ready to be set up!""","Basically we're moving our users into a temp office while their main one is being renovated. We get the call that they have all their stuff in their new space ready to be hooked up so we tell them we'll be over there in a few minutes (the temp office is across the street from the main one). They say great, they're going to go to lunch while we take care of business and be out of our way and also let us know they will be going out to a place thats about half an hour away. All good. 

My coworkers and I get over there and find their offices. They were set up and their desks all nice and how they wanted them. However we were now seeing some problems. They had the movers put their giant filing cabinets not only in front of wall outlets, they had them put in front of wall ports! And when I mean giant, they were giant. A single one weighed a couple hundred easily when it was full, and they were all full. The truly frustrating thing about this is that we emailed every department that was being moved to make sure the movers didn't put their shit in front of the drops or outlets. 

To make matters worse the only tech related stuff they had over in their offices were their monitors and printers. We couldn't find their actual laptops nor their docking stations anywhere. We scoured each and every box and filing cabinet just to be sure. Finally we ended up calling them on their lunch and they told us ""Oh yeah, all of our laptops are in this car we drove to lunch in the town 30 mins away, we'll just let you know when you get back!""

Okay great, what about all of your stuff blocking access to literally everything we need to get you guys connected? ""Oh sorry we didn't think that'd be much of a problem! Guess we'll call the movers to come back and rearrange too!"".

So yeah their office won't be ready until Friday now since the movers' are on schedule for the other departments and we'll be busy with those ones as well. Seriously how do you think you're ready for us to set you up if you take the things we need to set up with you????

It took us both a fair bit of time to actually make the software work as intended. Then, I updated our instructions and sent it to them, so when someone from our department needs that particular bit of software, there's specific instructions on how to go about it.

Looking into it, we see that the traffic is coming from a terminal server, towards a domain controller, the user is on a Windows account which has low level admin rights, like a junior admin. After a analyzing the logs, and not seeing anything else suspicious we decide to just call the user. He had the following explanation:

&gt;""I was trying to see what the IP was on a host, so I wanted to do a NSLOOKUP of that host, but I forgot the include the hostname"" 

(this matches what we saw, just a ""nslookup.exe being run from the windows event 4688"").

&gt;""Then I got into the nslookup program, but I didnt realise it, so I typed LS to see which folder I was because it looked odd. I realised that I was inside NSLOOKUP so I just exited the command and tried again with hostname included. I dont even know what a zone transfer is.""

And that was when I realized that if you do that, it's the same as typing ""nslookup -ls"" which actually does an AXFR query towards the primary DNS server, which in this case was also the domain controller. I love this job lol...",1,1633503391
1806,I didn't think anything bad would happen if I disconnected it,"So I work for an international robotics company that is primarily used in healthcare. The robots drive around hospitals and deliver medications and lab samples to various departments as well as carry dirty and clean linens. They run pretty smoothly and are good at navigating around just about any obstacle that comes in their path. Our help desk monitors them all day and makes tickets on any issues that arise. And anything that is hardware-related that occurs gets sent to us in Service, where I work. We source techs either from our company or third party to make repairs to our equipment. I'm the most senior person next to our boss but will soon be replacing him as he is retiring. Anyway, with all that said, what happened over the weekend was nothing short of scummy and downright dangerous.

I was on call for the weekend but was able to do all my work from home. Not too busy at all. Well I get a call on Sunday morning at 5 AM from help desk saying there'd been an accident with one of our robots at a local hospital. It hit a nurse and they were knocked over and got hurt. So I went to the office and got my tools and parts I thought I'd need and headed out. Immediately I saw the problem: a sensor was damaged and someone covered it up by disconnecting it so our software wouldn't catch it (it's complicated). Well this robot has a blind spot when making a u-turn, and this sensor was essentially its blindspot mirror. And a nurse happened to be standing right in its path and ran over her foot and she fell down.

I was fuming but made my repair, got it working and immediately got on the phone with help desk and asked who worked on it last. He gave me the name of one of our newer people and I told him to call him and get his ass to the office. I got back and both the new guy and my boss were there. We went in the break room and I just unloaded on him. No threats or anything like that, but calling him every insulting thing under the sun. Even I surprised myself with what I was saying. I eventually had to step away and that's when I heard my boss tell him ""You're done"". He was fired that day.

Like I said above, I don't regret what I said. Not at all. And the reason I was so mad wasn't just because of his negligence and stupidity. But because I had to miss breakfast with my daughter. That's mainly what sent me over.",1,1633467807

1811,"The Dreaded ""Upgraded"" Boards","Disclaimer: LTL, FTP. Also not an actual tech support worker; I'm one of those ""IT wizards"" who also happens to **intensely** look into all the tech my school uses, in case I have to *wizzard*.

Cast:

Me: A small wizzard, slowly beginning to gather an Aura of IT Prowess

Teacher: A poor teacher who got hit by the first wave of the ""upgrade"".

$School: The school, famous for buying whatever is new and shiny, and either being super paranoid and putting an insane amount of restrictions on that make it basically useless, or forgetting about it altogether.

Old Board (OB): The old touchscreen boards. Great, but expensive and proprietary.

New Board (NB): The new touchscreen boards. Cheap, but cheap.

Context:

Around 8 years ago, the teachers at $School got these big, bulky touchscreen boards. They had two components, a projector and a screen with pen and touch input. Each part had to be individually calibrated, powered, and connected. In other words, they were a huge pain. 

Except they weren't. The classrooms have seriously adapted to these hulking beasts. The calibration takes a few seconds, and every teacher knows how to do it. The boards have been given their own power sockets, which (probably) have their own higher power output. The teachers have also gotten really creative with integrating the boards into their lessons. But there's still the problem of the projector. All the projectors use proprietary light bulbs, which cost a ton each year. I'm assuming that's the main reason that $School switched.

Around 6 months ago, I was checking the $Schools Technology Resources website.

Website: ""$School no longer installs OBs.  NBs are a **better and lower-cost alternative.**""

I'm sure everyone here knows what that means.

Me: ""Welp. Here we go again.""

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to today, and the NBs start arriving. Apparently, the teachers weren't told until the day of. I don't know how true that is, but they definitely didn't receive much training. Or any training. At all. I walk into class to check these things out.

They. Are. MASSIVE.

Hulking giants compared to the already-huge OB. And half of the right side is taken up by a giant profile picture.

 Teacher takes out the pen, and opens up the OB's slides app. Not the greatest idea, but they've had these lesson plans for 8 years, and they didn't know about this until NOW. So, Teacher lays the pen on the board, and begins to draw a straight line on the graph.

L A G. Sooooo much lag. The line was at least 8 inches away from the pen.

And then the best setting ever activates. 

Hold to right click.

On a board marketed for drawing and similar activities.

So Teacher's spending time exiting the right-click menus, which takes forever because the laggy mouse input rolls over the menus and causes them to open again.

You think it's a driver issue? THERE'S NO DRIVER.

Calibrate the board? Do you have an hour or two to go through the settings?

Menus? Where? 

Long story short, I'm coming in to help this poor teacher. And everyone else, eventually. Maybe I'll make a part 2 if something interesting happens.

1815,Our users are awesome,"Apparently I work in a building full of unicorns. Or at least, according to what I've read on this sub over the past two years. I thought you might like to hear about it. Everything is kept vague for anonymity.

I needed a two year long apprenticeship as part of my education. I was very lucky to get hired at, let's call them, Awesome Friendly Scholars. Almost every single user, in this organization, is awesome and every interaction is always friendly, both in-person or over the phone.

Our users understand when I can't solve their problem right away and have to get back to them later. Sometimes I don't figure it out until a few days later, but they are still friendly and thank me when I finally fix the problem.

The people who need detailed, step-by-step guidance can be counted on two hands. When I say ""Please update your phone"" or ""You need to plug the monitor into the docking station and the docking station into the laptop"", they know exactly what I'm talking about and get it done within minutes. I have made a few instructional PDFs with screenshots, but I hardly ever have to send them to anyone.

There are different departments in the building, with separate budgets. We provide support for all departments, but only stock IT related inventory for our own. But, when a user comes in and asks for a new iPhone cable and I tell them I can't give it to them, even though they can see the cable sitting on a shelf, five feet away, they understand that we have separate budgets and happily submit a ticket for a new cable.

I have no problem sharing my direct number with our users, because they never abuse it. I often give it to them if they need to get back to me about an ongoing support ticket, but after our business is concluded, they call the support hotline next time. The same goes for Teams. We often text or call over Teams, but after the problem is fixed, I can be sure that they will create another ticket next time, instead of texting me directly. New employees often do this, but they go through the proper channels after I explain.

When I hand out new equipment, they already know that the wireless dongle is hidden inside the mouse. I can't remember ever having to tell someone where to find it.

They have no problem connecting to wireless display adapters on their own, when they need to share their screen. I have never had to teach any of them how to do it.

They respect our lunches. If they come in just as we are leaving for the cafeteria, they have no problem waiting until we are back.

They know about PEBCAK and often joke about it.

You may want to sit down for this one: Every time a user tells me that they already tried rebooting their laptop, they actually did reboot their laptop. All computers are tracked in real time and I can remotely look up startup times, down to the minute. Not a single user has ever lied to me about rebooting.

So, all in all an incredible place to work. My internship will soon be over and I'm really going to miss this place.

# Quarantine

Our users really showed their best side during the quarantine. Everyone was sent home very suddenly, and it was a bit of a nightmare, because we were not very well prepared. But they were absolute champs about it. Some examples:

One woman lived so close to the office that her laptop could just about whiff the wifi signal. This was a problem, because it prioritizes the office wifi, regardless of how weak it is. She couldn't work, because her laptop kept dropping her home wifi and connecting to the office for about a minute, then dropping that connection and reconnecting to her home wifi, in an infinite loop. And we couldn't remote in, for the same reason. We were also temporarily barred from entering the office, for any reason and we were not allowed to meet anywhere. In order to solve this, she had to sit in cold, damp bicycle shed, just outside the office while one of us remoted in to fix it. It wasn't me who helped her, so I don't know the details, but I know it took a good while, because the connection was still not very good. And she never once complained, but was grateful when we got it done.

Sometimes we needed to re-image a users laptop, but we were not allowed to meet for any reason. So, a temporary re-imaging shack was setup, where users could plug their laptops into power and Ethernet. We would then instruct them, over the phone, how to boot into PXE and we would take it from there. This was a bit of a hassle for many, but not a single one complained. They were very good at following our directions.

Several users had internet issues that we couldn't fix and understood when we told them that they had to talk to their ISPs.

Everyone was told to bring whatever equipment they needed home with them, but very few needed help to set it up. I think we only did one home visit.

Our VPN couldn't handle the sudden traffic, so we had to temporarily switch to another VPN provider. The new VPN software could not be installed at home, so every single user had to go to the office and stand outside, within wifi range, but out of social distancing range, while the software was installed. But, they all understood that it needed to be done.

This is where it gets really intense: About six months after we were sent home, no less than four directors sent emails out to the entire organization praising the IT department for our efforts during the quarantine. They specifically mentioned how quickly we adapted to the situation and got everyone up and running at home.

# Other stories

Here are some less awesome users and funny stories, presented in no particular order.

# Recycling Banshee

I was setting up mice, keyboards and monitors at some new desks. The keyboards came wrapped in a thin, white paper that I suppose looks and crinkles a bit like plastic, from a distance. I threw it in a recycling bin and was suddenly startled by a shrill scream, behind me.

""YOU CAN'T THROW PLASTIC IN THERE!!!"" A woman ran up and nearly dived into the bin after the paper. When she touched it, she realized it was paper and quickly got up and disappeared around a corner, without a word. I was too stunned by the sudden scream to get a single word out, throughout the whole interaction. I don't know who the woman was and never saw her again. If she ducks under her desk to hide, every time I'm in that part of the building, then that's just fine by me.

# Can't remote into the server

I got a call from a guy who said he couldn't remote into a server. He had tried almost 50 times before calling. I thought he might have been locked out because of too many failed logins, but his account was normal. I asked him to talk me through the login.

Our usernames start with the same three letters, followed by our initials, i.e. B4KXX, where XX is the users initials. Over the phone, he sounded out each button he was pushing and it all sounded correct. ""B... 4... K... D... B"", followed by his password. He did it a few times, with me on the phone, and when that didn't work, we tried creating a new password and sounding that out. It still didn't work. He did have rights to access this server and had done so before. I just couldn't figure out what was wrong.

Then I suddenly got an email from our head of security. The server had just warned him that someone had tried to remote in over 50 times, with wrong credentials. The email contained a screenshot showing the credentials used: BAKDB. He had been pushing A instead of 4 the whole time, even while sounding it out to me. I told him as such and thought I could hear a hand slapping a forehead.

# I accidentally Pavlov'ed a user

When a new employee is hired, they of course need a bit of training to get started. Most have no issues and some need a bit of hand-holding. And then there's Kevin. I'm sure many of you have had a user like Kevin. But, he really did try. He was friendly and always listened well, but almost anything I taught him seemed to be gone the next day.

Kevin kept his browser bookmarks in a Word document and would copy and paste links to and from this document. I showed him how to make proper bookmarks, but he would forget how the moment he closed the browser. The Word doc method worked well enough, so I just let him be.

Our staff intranet is set as the browser homepage, so it opens when you open the browser. But, when Kevin wanted to access the intranet, he would open the browser, completely ignore the page that just opened and copy and paste the link from his Word doc, into a new tab. He would often have two intranet tabs open, when I was at his desk. By some miracle, he never typed Google into the Google search bar.

All desks have a universal docking station where monitors and other accessories are plugged in, so you only need to plug a single cable into your computer. For some reason, Kevin would unplug his mouse and keyboard dongles, when he went home. Then he would call me the next day, because his mouse and keyboard weren't working. I tried to explain multiple times, but I wasn't getting through, so instead I waited for him to leave his desk. While he was gone, I plugged the dongles into the back of one of his monitors, where he couldn't see them. He never called me about that again.

Kevin needed certain software to do his job, but would always forget how to open said software, even when I pinned it to the taskbar. He had no problem opening his Word doc, so I took a screenshot of his desktop, added arrows that pointed to the icons on the taskbar and inserted the screenshot into the Word doc. That solved the problem. Until he somehow managed to pin another icon to the taskbar. He had pinned it to the right of all the other icons, so they were still in the same spot shown by the arrows in the screenshot. But, you see, now the taskbar didn't look like the one in the screenshot, so now he was afraid to click anything. I just updated the screenshot.

Those were a few specific things that stood out. Otherwise, he would call about all kinds of small issues that I can't remember. For the first month, he would call me almost every single day, and almost every single day, I had to repeat something that I had told him the day before.

Now, for the title of this section. I often talk our users through things, even while in the room, because I think they learn better when they get to try things out. Not so with Kevin. I always tried to talk him through it, but we would never get anywhere, so I always ended up taking over the keyboard and doing it for him. His (shared)office was at the end of a long hallway and his desk was positioned so I could see him while walking down said hallway. After about a month, I noticed that when I was on my way to his desk, he would immediately let go of his keyboard, as if it had suddenly burned his fingers. He didn't even look up first, he would just yank his hands away and *then* look up and wave to me. I'm a pretty heavy guy and my footsteps are a bit noisy. It honestly looked like I unintentionally conditioned him to let go of his keyboard, as soon as he could hear my footsteps. I thought that was pretty funny.

Kevin left the company after two months of employment. I don't know if he was fired or quit, but I'm sure it had everything to do him having a really hard time learning anything. It was a shame, because he was really nice and he honestly did try his best.

# Karen

Of course we have a Karen. No good workplace is complete without one. She is head of some smaller department and has a few people working under her. I never cared enough to find out what she actually does.

Karen does not trust the IT department because of an incident that took place before my time. As I understand it, she got a new laptop and when she made the switch, she lost all the work she had saved on her desktop. OneDrive was rolled out maybe half a year after I started, so they didn't have cloud backup at the time. She would have had to save her work onto a network drive or USB, before switching laptops. I don't know the details of how her work was lost, and I don't care to find out, because I can't stand being in the same room as her. I always work as quickly as possible, so I can get out. Anyway, because of The Incident, *every time* I'm in that part of the building, *for any reason*, I have to listen to the story about that one time when she lost all her work and it was a disaster and us IT guys ruined everything. All in that classic, condescending Karen tone that we all know and love.

Also, because of The Incident, she is very hesitant to let me touch her laptop. I once tried to push Enter, to close some dialog, and she snatched her computer away and held it up tightly to her chest, like an infant. So, while helping her with anything, I often have to look over her shoulder and tell her what she has to do. To her credit, she is pretty good with computers and follows instructions well. Although, she does so in a very mocking manner. She does this strange flourish with her hands, as if she is waving a magic wand around at the same time, like a fairy god-Karen. It's very irritating.

She is also very much against anyone under her getting new laptops. You see, this one time, when she got a new laptop, it was a huge hassle and she lost a bunch of work and us IT guys really dropped the ball, so no one gets new laptops, because it's just not worth the effort. Last time I cared to check, her employees had the oldest laptops in the building.

One time, a new employee was hired to work under Karen. When a new employee is hired, we typically order a new laptop for them, but Karen handed us an old Dell and told us to prepare it instead. I helped NewGuy get set up, but the relic he was given couldn't run the software he needed. I tried a few things, like updating drivers and reinstalling the software, but nothing worked. It was pretty clear that this thing wasn't going to cut it, so I made a suggestion to NewGuy. Karen was sitting at her desk, with her back to us. The words ""Looks like we're gonna need to order-"" hadn't even left my mouth before she whirled around like a Sufi dervish.

No! NewGuy was absolutely not getting a new laptop! Last time they did that, us IT guys really screwed up and she lost all her work and they were not going through all that trouble again! I just had to get *that* laptop to work and that was final! Nevermind that it was NewGuy's first day and he didn't have any work saved. But, sure thing, I said. Whatever you say, Karen. I would contact NewGuy, when I had a solution.

And a solution I did find. I went to our office and dug up another Dell laptop. This one was also aging, but was far newer than the one Karen had handed NewGuy. I re-imaged it and made sure it ran fine, then sent an email to NewGuy asking him to bring his laptop to the IT office. We swapped laptops and I asked him to please keep this between us. He agreed and I never heard another word about the matter. The newer laptop was the same color and roughly the same size as the old one, so I assume Karen never noticed the difference.

Recently, the organization went through some major restructuring. The building was basically split in half and we no longer support Karens department and a bunch of other departments, as well. So, I never have to deal with her again. Yay.

# Acknowledgements

I would like to thank my colleague, CurlyBro, for these past two years. You know who you are. It's been really great working with you. I was very nervous about starting at my first, real IT support job, so always having you on speed dial helped a lot. Thank you.",1,1633375732
1816,This Isn't That Difficult,"I work at a car dealership running the website, social media etc. Not IT technically but since we don't have an in-house IT person, everyone thinks editing a website means you know everything about computers. This just happened.

\*My email dings with an email from one of the three sales managers\* $Manager1: Hi froot\_loop, most of the vehicles on the website aren't displaying the additional fees, only the MSRP

This is an issue I've told the managers about at least five times over the last two years since we started using this website provider. I am on my lunch break but I know if I don't immediately reply I will keep getting harassed.

$Me: ""Yeah, that's because you have no sale price for the unit in our inventory system. Just add a sale price, even if it's identical to the MSRP and that will resolve the issue""

Five minutes later a different sales manager phones me. I am still on my break.

$Manager2: Hey, the fees aren't showing up for all these vehicles, can you fix that
$Me: That's because there's no sale price in the inventory system, just give them a sale price
$Manager2: So the fees just won't display?
$Me: Only if there's no sale price...just add a sale price

1820,The student employee with the (alleged) power to change your online banking password,"Finally, a story for this subreddit!

Cast:

$Me: Uh... me

$Co-worker: Another student employee

$User: Older gentleman, self proclaimed ""technology virgin""

&amp;#x200B;

So, for a bit of background, I'm a college student who works at our on-campus IT Help Desk. One of the things we directly interact with users for is password resets. On this particular day, a faculty member (not teaching staff, just a university employee) comes in to the desk in person looking for help filling out the campus conflict of interest form. As a project for his internship with the IT department of our campus, one of our other student employees created an online web app for submitting COI forms, and this is the first semester it is being used.

Anyways, this user apparently doesn't know his password because he almost never uses his university account. So, naturally, we go through the process of a password reset. Being student employees, our policy is that we can only do student password resets; staff password reset tickets can be created by us, but must be completed by Network Services. So, we create a password reset ticket for $user.

&amp;#x200B;

So, here's how our first exchange went (paraphrasing, btw).

$Co-worker: We'll get a ticket sent off to Network Services. We'll give you a call once your password is ready. What's your phone number?

\*user immediately rattles of two phone numbers like he's an auctioneer. My coworker had to ask for him to repeat it about 5 times just so he could pick out the numbers bit by bit as the user says his numbers as fast as possible each time.\*

$Co-worker: Perfect, someone will give you a call as soon as Network Services has reset your password.

$User: Well, I'll just come back in an hour, how's that.

\*leaves\*

&amp;#x200B;

So, an hour later, our user comes back, this time with me as the only employee currently at the IT desk.

$Me: Here's your new password, I'll write it down on a sticky note for you

$User: So this won't change my password, right? Cause as it is, my phone when I log in shows those little stars and enters my password for me (\*is describing autofill)

$Me: Well, yes, this does change your password, but . . .

$User: Well, shoot!! I don't want it to change my password!

$Me, internally: \*if you don't know your password, how do you expect to log in if we don't give you a new password?...\*

$Me: . . .you can always change your password once you're logged in to be anything you choose.

$User: So this changed my phone password, like for my bank and everything else??

$Me: . . . . . No, this only changed your password for university services. (\*wondering how a person could possible think a student employee at their university's help desk has the power to change their BANKING password\*)

$User: Oh, okay, that's good. If it changed my other passwords I'd have to go talk to {person} to have them fix my phone again. They do all of my technology stuff for me. So now how do I do the conflict of interest form?

$Me: Well, I don't have the link to the form handy, but when my co-worker who made the form is at work later today, I'll get the link from him and email it to you so you can fill it out.

$User: Don't bother, I'm a technology virgin, I don't know what I'm doing. When does your co-worker come in?

$Me: 11am

$User: Great, I'll see you at 11 so you can walk me through it.

&amp;#x200B;

For a bit of context, this COI form is ridiculously easy to use. As long as you're logged in, it auto-fills your name and department. All you have to do is enter your birthday and phone number (i believe, don't quote me on that) and either check or un-check boxes of different kinds of conflicts of interests you may or may not have. That's it. It's a perfect replica of the physical form that used to be used, but yet we've gotten tons of complaints that ""the new form is more complicated"" because apparently online = complicated, no exceptions. There have also been users who claim the form is broken because they ignore the note in the form that shows the exact format they need to have their phone number in for the form to be accepted.",1,1633364821
1821,"Clients can't follow instructions, even when they come with pictures.","Reading another story on here reminded me of something that happened the other day, an event which is becoming too common. To preface, I actually work in careers and employment support, not tech support. I've been running training sessions on Zoom and have been getting a lot of emails from clients that are struggling. The below is paraphrased slightly from memory and to be anonymous.

Client: Hi, I can't access Zoom, please assist.

Me: No problem, what exactly is the issue?

Client: I can't get Zoom to open.

Me: Okay so when you click the 'start Zoom' button on our training platform, do you get an error message of some kind, or does the screen change at all?

Client: It just won't open.

Me: Okay, if you can provide specific details that really helps. Are you clicking the 'start Zoom' button?

Client: There is no start Zoom button.

Me: Are you on page X of the learning platform?

Client: No I'm on page Y. 

Me: Okay so that's the problem, if you go to page X and click 'start Zoom', it will open the meeting for you. If you open the instruction document you were sent, it includes some screenshots of exactly what page you need to be on and what you need to click. I hope that helps. 

Client: I don't have the instruction document. 

Me: I'll reattach it for you now, please let me know if you have any more problems. 

A few hours later…

Client: Hi, I missed the training as I couldn't get into Zoom, can you book another one in for me? Also I need help getting into Zoom next time. 

Me: Sure, no problem. 🤦‍♀️

1826,documentation woes,"in this fine sub, we often hear about the need for documenting one's path to a resolution where one is not screwed over, because.. some dumbass that don't know shit said do it in a stupid way.

i hold good documentation sacred.  i had just spent a few months removing particles from space shuttle rcs spare parts. we were sending them down to white sands in heat sealed nylon bags.  hundreds and hundreds of different small parts, most of them valve parts because shuttle valves be insanely complicated. mostly i was rinsing these parts in the clean room, trying not to whine too much about what a145 fahrenheit de-ionized water jet feels like on my tender fingers for 8 hours a day.

i am new to this team, they let me touch space goodies, they are my heroes. we are providing the parts as well as complete reaction control engines. every shuttle had 44 of our engines aboard.

i want so badly to help build a shuttle engine, but i am only allowed to gaze over Jaime's shoulder and drool like a one year old as he builds good ones.

Jaime assembles 25 pound vernier and 900 pound mains, he won a silver snoopy award from nasa for his careful craftsmanship across a long time. my tears flowed down my cheeks when i saw him accept the award from an astronaut.

so Jaime knew how to make the best ones. i got to read the process documentation he used. it was amazing, so fucking concise. i was staring at apollo, sweet good writing like this. i once got a 3 buck an hour raise for working on documentation, and i held what i was reading sacred.

so, Jaime is pissed, some dork was hired to write assembly documentation for a master like him.

he asked me to read the new plan, i knew how he did it, i had watched him. i knew how i would do it if asked, do it like Jaime...duh

i could not believe how the original was corrupted, three times the wordage, one third the understanding of what the fuck am i doing?",1,1633294841

1828,The white isn't white enough,"Not sure if it really counts as tech support but here goes...

  
I'm a web and graphic designer, and I designed a flyer for one of my clients. I sent the design to her via email. It's really hard to match colours from the screen to print, especially since monitor colours don't match up to their local office printer. Plus screen colours are in RGB, so there are literally some colours that are unachievable in a physical print. Usually, for exact colour matching, we have to use Pantone swatches or when they send it for the actual print, they can sort it out and tweak with the actual technician.  


I received a call immediately, and she mentioned that she printed out the flyer on their company's office printer. I readied myself for the usual spiel about how monitor colours don't match the printout... etc. etc...

Conversation goes like this:

  
Client: 'Hey, I printed this out and the colours don't match what I see on the screen.'  


Me: 'Yeah, don't worry about that, every monitor is different and you can't calibrate it to match your office printer. I used the exact CMYK colours for your logo and fonts.  


Client: 'Well even so the colours look correct on screen but not when I print it out.'

Me: 'I've used the exact CMYK colours, so you don't have to worry about it. Your professional printer will ensure that you get the right colour.'  


Client: 'Yes, but the whites are white enough.'

I was quickly checked my file, did I leave a translucent layer on by accident? No, it was perfectly #FFFFFF.  Told her that the white is as white as it can be.  


Client: 'Well, the white ink is not very white.'

I was stunned. Office and home printers don't have... white ink. It's just the white paper. Any white areas are basically just paper that hasn't been printed on.  


I tried hard to explain this concept to her. That printers don't print the white. Regardless, she insists that they do. I tell her that it cannot be done on an office/home printer, it literally requires a separate offset printing plate that only large commercial printers use. And even then, seldom do people print white at all.   


She insists that her printer does print white, and that the design I sent her simply isn't white enough.

I tell her maybe her paper stock is white? Maybe the paper itself is yellowish?

Client: 'No, it's not my paper, it's that your white isn't white enough. Look, I've used some of my liquid white-out on the paper. It's very white. Your design is not printing the white colours properly.'

I was flabbergasted. Couldn't laugh out loud. She literally used white-out on the print-out and complained that the correction fluid was whiter than the paper.  


Can't really remember what happened after, but she showed her boss and he seemed happy with the design. So everything went well I suppose.",1,1633261591

1832,The Previous Technician Knew What They Were Doing,"I was working help desk as a Tier 1 technician, and I was working from home because of the pandemic. I was employed at a managed services provider that had multiple clients across various industries. For some clients, I was a glorified ticket maker, and for others I followed a simple checklist providing basic trouble shooting steps. 

As for our major clients, I followed an extensive list. That usually involved holding their hand through step-by-step instruction documents or walking them through hardware checks. Frequently, I would remote in to check various settings, collect logs/screenshots, contact vendors, and running scripts, patches, etc. 

Slap a bandaid on it to get the system and/or the person working. That was our supreme goal. Otherwise, the issue(s) are escalated to Tier 2 which was the client's corporate/internal IT. Overall, this was not very fulfilling because I always wanted to do more and spend more time on things. However, at least I got a lot of exposure as well as strengthened - and sometimes flexed - my customer service skills.

Anyways, the other techs and I would often reminisce on what collective trope a major client's users were spitting at us. Generally, they said these things out of spite. One that we frequently suffered, when informing users the issue had to be escalated, they would exclaim, ""The previous technician knew what they were doing."" 

Followed by some flavor of ""How come they were able to fix this but not you?""

""Can I talk to the previous technician?""

""I want to talk to your boss."" 

And so...

much....

more...

For your context, at the time of the story, I had been at this organization for about a year, and well acquanted with much of everything. Things clicked and I was in my stride. Irate, insulting, and incorrigible callers no longer negatively affected my mood or energy. I was a zen professional.

So I was at the tail end of my shift, sometime in the evening, when a user called in about some issue. A polite, elderly genetleman who had troubles with some of the company's proprietary software. After remoting in and investigating, it appeared to be something I had dealt with before, but whatever the case, I had to soldier on. Within the realm of what I was allowed to do, I exhausted all efforts. I let the user know I had to escalate the issue to Tier 2.

Unsurprisingly, the user started to berate me, ""The previous technician knew what they were doing."" Then followed up about how they talked to a technician several hours ago that was an expert and quickly resolved their earlier issues.

My eyes widened as I recognized I had talked this user earlier. I checked the call history, and I was the only other person they spoke with that day. I felt a rush of excitement, but I quickly contained myself. 

I verbally acknowledged and let the user elaborate. It was back and forth scorning me and praising the previous technician. They condemned me further going so far as to accuse me of being new. All the while, unbeknowst to the user praising me, stating the previous technician demonstrated expert skills and was knowledgeable in all things IT and customer service.

The user's insolence probably took up a good five minutes. Plenty of rope had been laid out at this point. I think there was a brief moment of silence indicating the user had ran out of gas. 

I was a rock dropped in water. I can imagine the ripples of emotion develop on his face as I listened with glee the audible stammers and fumbling of words over the phone and his wife's sudden outburst of laughing as I responded, ""Sir, that previous technician was me.""

There was another weak and helpless attempt or two to deflect. I quickly affirmed that I was the previous technician going into further details of our earlier encounter. Then once again informed them I was escalating the issue to Tier 2. The user meekly uttered an okay and hung up the phone.",1,1633199106

How I thought it started, while spending countless hours at my screen rending with sketchup and making blueprints with AutoCAD, my system glitched and closed all programs. So I tried crt-alt-del which opened but my mouse and touch pad were both unable to input commands. Tried to shut it down, wouldn’t turn off, then UPDATE appears in Microsoft. Even if I wanted to click it it would not let me. So force shut down, I was in a panic. This is my work my future my life for the moment. I waited five mins to start back up. 
The startup as my device started up I noticed it wasn’t a usual start up. BIOS system crash need to update. I couldn’t stop it and wasn’t sure if I should. I watch the update proceed thinking ‘okay this will fix the input issues and I will have control with my trackball mouse again.’ No this was not the case. So now I’m full out hyper ventilating, it’s 2am and I still have work to do. So use key control I uninstalled my mouse drivers reinstalled, uninstalled video, reinstall, etc. 
Laptop seems fine.

My heart stopped. Two days no sleep trying to fix my laptop and finish my assignments.

I barely had enough control to look at my network traffic. Any controls I put in setting would flip back. And reading the com Peing saw my device is set with loops and nods loops at 0.0002500 seconds. I pull out my old laptop get on with profs trying to fix the issue. We couldn’t, they don’t even think it’s safe to do a back on USB and run a cleaning on it. 
Now another prof reaches out saying class is delayed because his sound and mouse stopped working then had a system crash followed by a BIOS update. 
I’m desperate to fix this issue but the coding seems to be rewriting itself and I can’t access it to change it. Can you help?",1,1633192065
1834,"Red wire, black wire, white wire…. Oops","A friend of a friend (long story) had a skee ball game they wanted me to try fixing for them. It was one of the first to have circuit boards, so I didn’t really know what to expect. However, there is good news: schematics are available. The bad news is that the wiring to the bottom half is somewhat butchered and some of the connectors are cracked and would need replacement.

After replacing the damaged power cord, I plugged it in and it appears that the motherboard at least boots up. The screen animates in what I call a “zeroing around” pattern. I can see missing segments but that may be an easy thing to fix: These older machines actually used incandescent bulbs behind the segments. But first, I need to find the wires for the coin switch, and see if the logic responds to that and starts the game.

On the schematic, I find that the coin switches go to the 3 pin connector that has the color code, white, red and black. No problem! I find a handy little wire, and stick it between the red and black wires, and POP! The machine looses power.  

Watt? Well, darn. I guess I blew the fuse. So I take the fuse out and FSCK! The fuse is intact! Now I’m really getting that sinking feeling that I just made a very expensive and embarrassing mistake. The lights in the room are still on, so I don’t think the fuse in the house blew, because most houses have the outlets and lights in a given room on the same circuit. However, where does this extension cord go, exactly?

I follow it to a power strip… which is receiving no power even though the switch is on. I follow that to the outlet, and you guessed it, the GFCI has turned off. I press reset and HALLELUJAH! The game comes back on, completely unharmed!   
 Reexamining the entire schematic before touching anything else, I figure out what I did. The ball release solenoid runs on the high voltage AC from the wall, using a simple triac to turn it on. They used the same wire colors on the connectors for the ball release solenoid as they did for the coin switches. The ground wire was red instead of green, but white is still neutral and black is still live. So, I had connected live directly to ground! Thankfully I didn’t use a bare paper clip for that purpose or I’d probably be dead.  

In the manufacturer’s defense, the 2 connectors are far enough away from each other that the wires for the “wrong” one would be too short to actually plug them in together. So in the end this was really my fault for not reading the entire schematic (or indeed, the entire PAGE of said schematic) before I started crossing wires!  

There had been times in the past where I had gone down the rabbit hole of tracing out every single line and trying to understand what everything meant, thus tripling the time it took me to repair something because I didn’t see the forest through the trees (e.g. missing a broken solder connection or obviously burned out transistor, connector that works if you push on it, or whatever) so that is why I jumped at the opportunity to just say “Okay, I found what I’m looking for, let’s try this!”

By the way, if the title sounds familiar, it is a paraphrasing of a kid’s book my Mom used to read me, where it would say something like “red socks blue socks white socks” and then “oops” with a picture of, for example, someone putting the socks on their hands instead of their feet, putting their shirt on backwards, or whatever.  

TL;DR: Read the entire schematic first, or trace the wire all the way to the source! Otherwise, you might fry the machine or worse, yourself!",1,1633182543
1836,Dear lusers,"Dear lusers, we techy people would be able to solve your problems faster if you could just do a few things for us okay?

DO NOT LIE TO ME!!!!! I can almost always tell what idiot thing you did just by looking at some log files.

Be detailed in your explanation of the problem. Saying ""it's broken"" or ""not working"" tells me nothing. 

Me: So what is the problem you're having?

Luser: It's not working.

Me: what do you mean? Are you getting any error messages?

Luser: It's not working!!!!

Me: Are you not able to logon, is the application not loading, is your computer currently in flames?

&amp;#x200B;

Yes I do think you're stupid and yes I am talking down to you. My kids at the age of 10 had a better grasp of how to operate a computer than you do.

I am not customer service I am tech support. I'm not here to kiss your ass, I'm here to fix whatever it is you broke. 

If I ask you if something is plugged in I am not insulting your intelligence, this is just a basic troubleshooting step.

Me: Is the monitor plugged in?

Luser: Of course it is, I'm not stupid

Me: No it's not and yes you are.

&amp;#x200B;

No I don't expect you to know how a computer works but I do expect you to know how to OPERATE one. This is how you sound...

Luser: My car won't start

Mechanic: Well what happens when you turn the key?

Luser: I don't know I'm not a car person!!?! Just fix it!

&amp;#x200B;

If you call in a ticket then go on vacation for a week don't you dare be offended when I close your ticket.

Me sending you emails with questions require a response and for fuck sake read the entire message and answer all three questions not just the first one.

I am not clairvoyant I do not know you are having a problem until AFTER you open a ticket.

Barking ""unacceptable"" at me when you don't get what you want gets you  NOTHING except my disdain for your existence. I have a myriad of rules I am held to so sucks to be you if you don't like it. 

We're nerds and like fixing things and enabling technology for people the least you could do is cooperate with us and pay attention when I give you instructions/ask questions.

Early in my tech support career I always tried to take time to educate people on how to use a computer/software. I enjoyed it when someone would say ""wow I didn't know that, thanks so much"". Now it's just ""service me IT minion and be quick about it"". My empathy for people that struggle with technology when they have to use it on a daily basis to do their job has been completely beaten out of me. So many people can't even be bothered to think about what is going on and just call us and expect us to magically fix it.

Lastly... OPEN A FUCKING TICKET!!!!! Don't text/IM/email/call me when you have a problem. I have to justify my existence to manglement just like you do and I can only do that with tickets.",1,1633175675
1837,The Quantum Computer,"Scene: Its late evening, im just coming into work and the coffee hasn't yet had a chance to settle. I spark up the command center and log into the system and am greeted with a ticket of a user complaining that their computer is overheating. 

After reading the ticket I gleaned that the user was likely putting their computer in sleep mode and in order to prevent the fans from running they would need to shut the computer off in order for it to not heat up their bag / overheat the computer.

I typed up an email to ask the standard questions, get back that indeed they are putting it into sleep mode because:

""I need all of my applications to be open on the pages I need them to be when I open my computer, i don't want to wait for it to load up, just help me find a setting that allows me to keep the computer cool.""

I reply back that there are basically two options, sleep mode and power off. Type up a nice email and that is all I hear for two days. 

Two days later *spongebob voice*

I get a phonecall in the que of a man so pissed off he can barely talk, and references his ticket number. I pull it up and wouldn't you know it, its the overheating computer user. 

I go over troubleshooting again, establishing the issue, what is happening and why and explain to the user that they will need to decide between sleep mode and turning the PC off, they then explode at me and declare that I: ""JUST NEED YOU TO FIX IT, YOU GUYS KNOW HOW TO DO THIS I KNOW YOU DO"". 

""Sir if you figure out how to make a computer be both off and on simultaneously please, let me know because I want to come work for you.""

&amp;#x200B;

We were on client sites, using our client-provided equipment to connect to the client systems for our day-over-day work and we also had company laptops for connecting to our corp. systems (think timesheets and yearly reviews).

As IT (even though we were application development), we were expected to be our own first-level support. And since we didn't use them every day, things would stack up - think getting six Windows updates delivered when you tried to shut down.

So by the time we had to call the help desk, we had done all of the usual things such as restarts, and it was both a real problem and it was almost always something messed up deep in the company systems and we were rarely the first to hit the problem.

The problem was that our internal IT help desk was staffed only by the nicest and smartest people in the world. So instead of dreading the calls, we actually looked forward to them.

You would explain the problem, and the analyst - they were mostly ladies - would say, ""Oh, that's thus-and-such, I've had to fix it for three other people this week.  Click Click. OK, fixed, give it five minutes to propagate from our local server up to you guy and you'll be good to go.""

I had to reimage a machine bought through the Employee Purchase Program, ""Oh, you bought that machine for home. I did too, and I love it. But to reimage it, you need the new disk that just came out, don't use the old one or the one you can download, let me get the right disk sent to you.

1848,Can you reset my password? Again?,"  

While I don't work in IT, it never seems to fail that I become the ""Tech Guy"" and get asked to do all the tech stuff on top of my regular job. I work in public safety, so we weren't exactly hired for our computer skills and our agency is not really big enough to justify a dedicated IT position. I was given the task (among several other things) of creating and deleting user accounts and resetting passwords for our records software.

My biggest headache of course was re-setting locked accounts. Some people forget to type their username when logging in and end up locking the last user’s account quite often, while others seem to just always forget their password. But one user always seemed to have trouble. Also, most people do not have one computer they always use. There are many computers and users won’t likely use the same computer one day to the next. This will come up later.

I get an e-mail from a user one morning that their password isn't working. I log in and see that they have 9 failed password attempts, which meant not only did they type the wrong password 3 times and disable their account, they tried six more times after being told ""Contact your system administrator.” Not unusual and it might not even be their fault as mentioned above. I unlock the account, give them a generic temporary password, and go on about my day.

A few hours later I get a call from the same user.

**User:** That password isn’t working. I typed “some\_generic\_passowrd”, and it isn’t working.

**Me:** That’s the correct password. I’ll reset it right now and you can try to log in.

**User:** Nope, still not working.

I see the failed log in attempt under his profile so at least I know they got their username right. Since I have them on the phone, I give them a super simple password and have them log in.

**User:** \[lots and I mean LOTS of typing and clicking\] It’s still not work… oh wait, there we go. It says my password expired. I thought you just reset it for me.

**Me:** Yes, but it is only temporary. You have to create your own password now and it has to have be \[list of requirements\]. Make sure it is something you will remember.

**User:** OK, thanks.

I don’t think much of it and go about my day. A few days later I get an e-mail from **User** asking to reset their password. They’re super apologetic about it but honestly, it’s just a forgotten password; I’ve had worse calls \[like someone deleting an entire person by accident\]. Oddly the account is not locked out and there are no failed log in attempts, so I give them a call.

**Me:** Hey I got your e-mail, it’s ok. Your account shows it isn’t locked and I don’t see any failed log in attempts. Are you using your username? What is it telling you when you try to log in?

**User:** \[lots of typing and clicking\] It says “Could not establish a connection to the server” I typed my username and password and that’s all that happens.

That’s not unheard of.

**Me:** That’s not unheard of. Close the log in prompt and try again. Make sure you let me know what you are doing and what messages show up.

**User:** \[walking me through each step they’re taking\] And I’m in, you fixed it!

**Me:** Ok, sounds good to me, have a good day!

This happens a few more times over the next several weeks and they are never able to really explain what happens before I get involved. Inevitably by time they get me on the phone it seems to be working again. There are several times where I again notice they don’t have any failed log in attempts and their account is not locked. I do reset their password a few times but never end up having too much trouble getting them in with a little patience.

Fast forward a few months and my co-worker and I are asked to assist with a server migration. One task is to go to each computer in the building and enter the new server configuration, update the software, and re-name the old server settings. This is accessed from a settings button on the log in screen. A new dialogue box allows you to select an existing server configuration or create a new one. I set up the first few computers without an issue, but then I come to a computer that I know **User** uses quite often.

I open the server configuration settings and there are TEN servers listed. The legacy server, the test server and 8 servers with variations of **User**’s username or full name. I open the settings for the first one and I find something like:

**Server Address:** \[user’s username\]

**Port:** \[super\_simple\_password\]

I find variations of this for every additional server entry in the list. This explains everything; the loads of clicking and typing and the “Could not establish a connection to server” was **User** going into settings and creating, and saving, a new server each time. I chuckled and called **User** over. We chalked it up to they were never shown how to properly log in and they had a laugh too. **User** was happy, they didn’t have to keep asking for new passwords, and we didn’t have to keep resetting them. By the end of the update, I found around 5 more times where this was done on other computers.",1,1633066613

Received a call from the Operations Officer (no, I'm not going to explain what an Ops Officer does, or explain any other Army acronyms, abbreviations, or jargon. This post would be ridiculously long) telling me he needed a new VoIP phone (we used VOIP phones on our classified network, POTS phones for unclassified calls), because his was broken. Since I took care of all officer issues personally, I grabbed a spare phone of the shelf and headed over to his office. When I arrived, he was on the POTS phone talking to a buddy from another unit. He gave me a disdainful look, and pointed to his VOIP phone, which was sitting on the printer in his office. When I picked it up, bits of plastic fell off, the screen was cracked in multiple places, and the handset was held together by the wires inside. 

Jeezus? WTH happened to this poor phone? 

Oh well, phone surely doesn't work. I plugged in the spare, and checked that it worked correctly. I was waiting for the Ops O to get off the phone to tell him the new VOIP phone was ready for him when I overheard this:

""Yeah, I am getting a new VOIP phone. I got mad at what I heard and threw the old one against the wall.""",1,1633034354

I changed careers a few years ago. I have a couple of degrees in computer maintenance and networking technology. I got tired of doing that and made a career change into industrial maintenance. I work for a major food producer now and work on everything from bearings and grease to electrical and printers. I've only done this for about 3 years now. Most of you reading this in the US have my product in your refrigerator right now. 

One of the machines goes down this morning. It is a very advanced machine. Kind of crazy all of the technology used on it. I come over to the call late to see if I can help. One of my fellow mechanics is there along with our lead. I'm just a bystander at this point. They call in our supervisor, he calls his supervisor, and another lead shows up. There are 6 of us working on this machine. 

I poke around a bit based on the error on the screen. I talk to my lead and tell him what I think it is. I'm kinda brushed off, ignored. I watch a little longer. I speak up again and am ignored They're pulling the machine apart checking on different things. 

We've been here for an hour at this point and I'm freezing my ass off. Plus the company is losing between$15-20k an hour that the equipment is down. I look at my buddy and say ""hand me your dykes bro"" I reach down and clip a zip tie off some cables while everyone else is looking at something else. 

I look up and everyone is staring at me... the big boss incredulously asks, ""what did you do???""

At first I'm thinking I f**ked up and accidentally cut something I shouldn't have... ""I cut a zip tie...""

""All the errors just went away, show me what you did!""

I proceed to show them that I cut a zip tie off of a multi-mode fiber jumper that was causing a kink (not really a kink, but a sharp bend). Then I had to explain that fiber shouldn't have a bend &gt; 30 degrees. 

This machine has about 8 drives that control servo motors, each drive is in series with the drive next to it linked with MM tx/rx jumpers between them. 

Errors on the screen: ""checksum failed"" ""check fiber optic cables""... ""x1 drive checksum error"" ""check fiber optic cables""... ""x2 drive checksum error"" and so on...

This isn't to degrade them in any way, they are all extremely intelligent and they would normally run circles around me. If fact, I'll probably end up calling them for help by days end!

He tells me her spacebar is broken and asks if I can supply her with another keyboard. I said ""sure no problem"" as we have dozens of them. They wear out and get replaced from time to time. No biggie. 

I grab one that's in decent condition and head on over. They both greet me and he gives me a weird look and says, ""Here's the old one..."" and hands me a keyboard with a literally broken spacebar. As in a spacebar key actually broken in half. I say ""Oh okay so it's actually broken."" I ask her ""How'd that happen?"" 

She says, ""I don't even know! It just broke somehow! I don't even know when it broke."" 

Ok. Sure.

The other guy cracks a few jokes about her typing too hard and we all have a few laughs about it. She obviously knows how it broke and while I generally don't care about these kind of things but I can't help but wonder what the hell she did to that keyboard.

So our FNG is out on a customer visit. Even after the previous fiasco of not knowing how to find his IP he has been sent out to upgrade the OS of a clients internet router that terminates multiple T1s. Shocker he screws it up. So it’s now 3am and they have no internet. The customer and FNG are hanging out in front of a Starbucks trying to download this massive file because hotspots weren’t quite a thing yet. 

FNG is wandering around the vendor’s site trying to find the correct file talking to himself and getting frustrated. It’s about this time that the customer notices some movement in his side mirror. He tells FNG not to make any sudden moves. A moment later two officers guns drawn kindly ask them to step out of the vehicle. Apparently this Starbucks had been robbed repeatedly. We send another engineer out to complete the work as the engineer decides he’s done for the night the engineer managed to delete the OS file and replace it will a config for a switch we have never heard of.  We don’t know where he got the config file but he renamed it to os.txt. 

I would like to say that he stayed around for more adventures but right as the company was about to let him go he managed to break his arm falling in a network closet while getting tangled up in cat5 cable.

1862,That time I kicked someone in the crotch over TCP/IP,"Been a while since I last posted, but I just remembered this story today. It's short and sweet, so here goes.

I work as a Senior Software Engineer at a small software company. Being a small company, I wear multiple hats. I handle gathering requirements, developing software, project deployment and post-deployment support. The whole lifecycle. One of the software packages I am responsible for is our Point of Sale software, that integrates with our company's flagship software package.

As it is my software, I handle new deployments and support cases for this product. Many of our clients prefer us to remote in to their PoS terminal to solve issues, rather than coming on-site. This saves them a callout fee, so they're happy enough to have someone on-hand to help with anything that can't be done remotely. Mostly this involves hardware testing. ""Okay, scan a barcode. That scanned? Good. Did the receipt come out? Does it look right?"" You know the drill.

One of our clients was having issues with their receipt printer and cash drawer. This hardware was very old, and updates to the PoS software had caused a compatibility issue with their hardware drivers. Luckily, updating the hardware driver package for the receipt printer/cash drawer and setting the devices up again resolved the issue.

I was on the phone with one of the store clerks for this particular client, testing out the hardware. We'd just tested the receipt printer, which printed perfectly. Final thing to test was the cash drawer. I'm sure you can see where this is going.

Me: ""Okay, that's working. Now we're going to test the cash drawer. I'm going to kick the drawer, and you tell me if it opens or not.""

Clerk: ""Okay.""

Me: \*clicks button\*

Random customer: ""Excuse me...""

Cash drawer: \*ka-chunk\*

Clerk: ""Oof!""

As soon as I clicked the ""No Sale"" button, a customer tried to get the attention of the clerk at the terminal. The cash drawer popped, and the clerk turned towards the customer, and caught himself right on the edge of the drawer as it was springing out.

1863,A bit of a missile problem.,"Way back when a friend worked in support for a large aircraft / missile manufacturer.  Since gone and absorbed.  One of their products was the Harpoon missile designed to attack ships.  

One Scandinavian country owned some and in this specific case had a shore based installation.  These things needed periodic maintenance.  Among other things you ran a fake launch and it would “fly” to its target.  You could see fins move and monitor the internals and such.  Two guys were working on it.  They turned the key and the thing fired off!  One of them was even standing on it.  

So now you’ve got this unguided missile roaring through the harbor full of ships.  Somehow it managed to miss everything and make it five miles inland before it hit a house.  Nobody injured.  What they wanted from my friend was “did it fly straight in or did it do the plunging top kill like it was designed for?”

They ended up being fined $40,000 for “insufficient documentation”",1,1632926168

1865,vibe testing the beast,"apologies if this fails to meet every requirement in my favorite sub.

i remember staring, rapt, over my father's shoulder as he used the solder gun in the back of our tv in 1962. i have been in tech support since age 5, whether i know what i'm doin or not.

so now i'm standing in a ring of big brains and extremely capable experts the day before we put a defense department apogee engine into risk.

my boss, stood across the ring from me, he taught me how to protect a thruster during the vibe operations. i knew he had my back.

hell, he taught me how fashion the four teflon valve seats and let me wind the four valve solenoids that were attached in series feeding the 200 pound thrust engine. boss had trained me to perfection on those processes.

 i was the last asked to speak during this meet.  two foci for these critical vibe runs, the vibe commander must conform to the vibe profiles...sine, random...etc. 

while i will be hand placing 2 million dollars onto the vibe fixture, then vibe commander and i binding dozens of bolts to 55 foot pounds, then hooking up pressure, then measuring pressure, using very old apollo era leak detection technology. this was gonna be very difficult inside the vibe containment.  not much space to set up the sight glass/gas board as they called it back in the last century.

i am so scared of what may go wrong, as i might be the obvious cause

i had heard they want to hook up equipment i had not used before. i said i don't feel good about hooking up this brand new untested gear to a flight thruster. then i said i need to be trained how to operate this valve control box.

nobody contradicted me

customer program manager had audited our vibes for his other goodies before.  he stood up for me and said we shall do these extra steps.

then we made another good one, vibe commander and me, we passed the three day vibe.

I write you these tales of mirth and woe, of entertainment and anger with as much accuracy and as little embellishment as I can manage. Many conversations are written as best I can remember them from my notes and memories about the incidents they describe, but the heart of what you are about to read is as true as I can make it.

Names have been changed to protect the innocent. And the guilty. 

[Episode 8](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/ptz7bs/the_new_guy_chronicles_episode_8_watching_yout_er/)

The cast:

Jordan - FNG

Thomas - Me, the manager and network admin

John - The older of my two other reports, primarily responsible for server maintenance, major application upgrades, and supporting our smaller off-site locations and their specific applications

Daniel - The younger of my two original employees, though here for the same amount of time as John. Both longer than me, actually. Desktop and server support, document management and phone system support, phenomenal people skills.

What is happiness?  No such thing exists in this forsaken place.  All is barren wasteland, void of hope and meaning.  Woe.  Woe upon all you who dare tread here.  Heed my warnings and flee from this place of desolation.  All is-

Alas, I suppose you are here for another tale of Jordan the empty-headed and not my pleas for this company to be bathed in the cleansing fires of ruin and destruction.  Well, let us take a voyage back in time to...

**DAY 99** - The Sound of an Empty Head

A ticket comes in for [department].  They're having trouble watching (actual) training videos on our intranet system.  They can't hear any sound.  Jordan has yet to visit this department in his time here.  It's a little weird because they're actually a separate company that contracts to perform some services for us, but we support their IT needs in this location.  I inform him of the issue and take him down with me to visit.  

Me: ""Hey, [user], having some trouble?""

User: ""Yeah, we can't hear sound when we play videos.""

Me: *looking at the desk* ""Ah, no speakers.  That explains that.  We'll go grab you a set.""

We leave the office to head back to ours.

Jordan: ""So what's the problem?""

Me: ""What do you mean?""

Jordan: ""Well, do you think it's an internal problem or something?""

Me: ""What?  No.""

Jordan: ""Then what's the problem?""

Me: *visible confusion*  ""Do you not know what the problem is?""

Jordan: ""Well they said the speakers weren't working, but you said there were no speakers.""

Me: *visible confusion intensifies*  ""OK...""

Jordan: ""Isn't there an internal speaker?""

Me: ""No.""

*we enter our office*

Jordan: ""So what's the problem with it?""

Bewildered.  Confused.  Mystified.  I could empty a thesaurus into this story and not have the words to adequately describe the feeling of my brain doing a hard reset in that moment.  Jordan has lied, he's misunderstood, he's failed to follow instructions, wasted countless hours, driven users from his presence with his awkwardness, and otherwise proved himself incapable of faithfully discharging his duties.  But this?  This is a new low.  This is an unprecedented, heretofore never seen level of incapacity.  This, in the moment, I cannot handle.  

Blinking away my stupor I turn wordlessly from Jordan to our back storeroom.  I fetch a pair of speakers in a box and place them in his hands.

Me: ""Just... go install these.""

I turn from him, averting my eyes from the dull look upon his face.  Silently weeping with the knowledge that humanity could produce a 20-year-old ostensibly normal adult incapable of understanding ""computer with no noise-maker no make noise"" I slunk back to my office.

He managed to install the speakers.  The speakers managed to produce sounds.  I do not know if he managed to understand the connection.",1,1632853125
1871,Reading the email explains the email.,"My company just did a facelift/update on our major web systems this weekend. So yesterday and today have been a complete shit-storm of calls into the Help Desk. The major issue? The program shows up as a bite-sized portion in the browser instead of the full window/screen. The simple solution? Clear the cache. 

Our admin/Tier 1 sent out a company-wide email on Sunday with instructions (that I wrote, #humblebrag) how to clear the cache in all four major browsers (IE, Edge, Chrome and Safari), along with pictures in each. As with every issue, people fall into one of four camps:

* The Competent - they read the email, followed the instructions, and fixed it themselves. We love them. 
* The Absent-Minded - they saw a problem and called/emailed immediately. When we directed them to or resent the email, the situation was fixed. 3 out of 10 on the annoyance scale- mostly because they can be fixed via email instead of a callback. 
* The Toddlers - No matter how competent they are in their respective fields (I couldn't look at brain-wave patterns on a monitor and tell you whether a surgery was going well or not, for instance), some people are just inept with technology. They will call us every 90 days to help them reset their passwords, and they definitely called due to this issue. Maybe 5 out of 10 annoyance points? 
* The Liars - These people though... we send them the instructions and it's ""I already tried that, it didn't work."" Remote into their computers, follow the exact same steps, and what do you know? It's fixed.   


Of those latter folk, the lady who just bitched me out because ""why is Internet Explorer still on here if we aren't supposed to use it"" and ""I don't know what the hell Edge is"" wins my least favorite person of the day award.",1,1632849425
1872,Laptop Webcam - PLS FIX,"We live in the day and age now where online meetings have become common place. In the Before Times, my company was just beginning its transition to Teams and that was quickly expedited as we started to work from home. Of course, everyone and their mother needed a webcam because god help us if we cant see someone in a meeting. From what I understand if you arent on webcam you dont exist and cant contribute, or something like that, given the severity users seem to treat camera issues with.

Whatever. I soldier on, continue my duties, including new hires during the pandemic. Eventually bring on two laptop users, one of which is the $User in question. Give them their thinkpads, give them the IT walkthrough, explain all the usual shit to them ect ect, no problem. They seem competent.

Eventually I get a ticket from $HR: $User's webcam is broken and doesnt work, please repair immediately. Alright fine whatever, its not critical but Ill get pestered endlessly until I at least address this one.

I connect with $User's PC, and camera isnt working as expected. Driver updates, all the usual, nothing at all. Doesnt even show black - just doesnt appear to be there. So I get an idea:

$Me - $User, is the cover over the webcam?

$User - No, no cover

$Me - Do you see a little slide there at the top?

$User - No slide, no cover, sorry

I'm sure you can guess where it's going.

He deals with it for a little until we can both be in the office. He calls me over, and as soon as I see the laptop, I see the slide is in fact: there, and over his camera. I slide it open and walk away to sounds of astonished thanks. Thinkpad camera covers arent just covers - they hard disable the webcam when in place.",1,1632844044

1878,Employees shouldn't have to charge their own devices,"I am a L1/L2 helpdesk role in local government. 

We have had an issue my entire employment with a woman who complains her Surface Pro will not charge. Every time we ask she bring in her device, it's charging! Trial it at her desk, it's charging! We swap out her device with another of the same model in an attempt to satisfy her, and it's going great until ""it's not charging"" so she brings it in and what do you know, it's charging!

She explains she tries to charge it in the car sometimes. The car chargers are not supplied by IT so not supported, but we theorize her device isn't getting enough charge through her car. We ask if, when it's not charging she's trying in the car, she assures us it doesn't charge in the office as well.

Charging lady gets a new boss who is told about her issue not being solved by IT. New boss is not my boss, different department and business unit completely. She comes down with the device and we show her, it's charging! A refurbished device comes into IT shortly after and new boss claims it for charging lady as ""her device doesn't charge"" and new boss takes her old device despite its apparent charging issues (and has never complained about charging). Charging lady is onto her 3rd device now and wow, it's not charging!! We assure her it is charging, check at the power points, swap the charger, do everything we can short of actually charging it for her.

One afternoon my other L1/L2 tech answers a phone call from new boss. It went a little something like this:

&amp;#x200B;

New boss: So, I might have discovered why users device isn't charging. She lives off the grid, and it sounds like device isn't getting enough power.

Tech: Yes, we suspected it was not getting enough power through a car charger.

New boss: Well that's an issue, it's not fair for employees to have to provide power for their laptops.

Tech: ...Hm?

New boss: Not everyone can charge their devices. You should provide battery packs for charging.

Tech: ...

New boss: It shouldn't be their responsibility to charge the laptop in their home time.

Tech: Okay... but she can charge it in the office.

&amp;#x200B;

The role charging lady filled, involves her going to customer's property's. She finds it more convenient to go from home to the property first thing in the morning, then from the property to her home in the afternoon. Thank goodness my coworker took the call as she was more restrained than me in terms of preventing herself from laughing. 

She explained to new boss that the office had power, the user can put her device on charge at night and pick it up in the morning regardless of how inconvenient it was. We were not providing battery packs, and goodness knows how she thinks *those* charge.

We haven't heard about charging issues in a solid 4 months!",1,1632788405

1884,"""You have negative energy""","Hello all, 

Once again I am back with another story, this one took place earlier today. 

Before we begin I want to preface that I have a very tired sounding voice, this voice has gotten me in trouble a few times before but it really is my natural voice. This issue is compounded with the fact that the headsets we use make even the most chipper voices sound a bit harsher. That's really it for the background though, let's commence with the story.

This day started like any other Monday, not great but nothing out of the ordinary. This user happens to call in close to 11, and the call goes something like this;

&gt;Me: Hello, thank you for contacting the \[insert company name here\] help desk, I'm EonThief how can I help you?  
&gt;  
&gt;User: Yes, I reset my password and am having issues receiving emails now.  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: Yeah I can definitely help you with that, can I have your IP address?  
&gt;  
&gt;User: My what?  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: \**Slower this time*\* Can I have your IP address?

Now I didn't think much when I repeated the question, after the headsets we use are kinda trash and users do have a hard time hearing us sometimes. This user on the other hand took it very personally.

&gt;User: Excuse me sir you don't need to be so negative with me.  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: \**very confused*\* I'm sorry?  
&gt;  
&gt;User: You have this negative energy surrounding you for some reason, and I don't enjoy it.  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: Again sir, I am sorry however this is just my normal voice.  
&gt;  
&gt;User: No sir I don't believe you, you just have a very negative energy. It's very frustrating, especially when I've been pleasant with you.  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: Sir, I can assure you this really is just how my voice is.  
&gt;  
&gt;User: No sir, you are just very negative. I don't understand why you're so pissed off?  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: I promise you I'm not mad or annoyed, this is just how I talk normally.

We proceeded to go back and forth for about 5 minutes before I was able to get the information from him, meanwhile my coworkers are listening in on my call trying not to laugh to hard because this guy won't stop fighting me. 

The call ended fairly uneventfully, and the worst/best part is had the user not fought me, I would've wrapped up his issue in a minute or two.

It's a very short story, but I figured someone else might be able to get a laugh out of it at least.",1,1632763578
1885,"Hello, IT. Have you tried turning it on?","Going to keep this short, since I’m posting on mobile.

A few weeks back, I (non-IT) got a call from the supervisor of a neighboring department. Now, I’ve spent some time working in that department when they’re short-handed, so I have a good rapport with that supervisor.

“Help! I can’t print X that we really need right now. Can you please print it?”

“Ok, sure.” Print X, walk it over, notice in passing that they’re very busy. Well, I’m kinda busy too, so I just chalk it up to difficulties with computer or something and go back to my work.


#One Hour Later
My supervisor walks up to me and asks me to go over to that same neighboring department.    “They’re having trouble with this specific printer they need to print X (from earlier). Can you help them fix it?”

So, back I go. Their supervisor is very happy to see me, and says:    “The printer isn’t working. I’ve tried everything I can think of. I even checked the cords to make sure it was plugged in properly.”

The printer has a distinctive light on the front, that is currently off. I glance at it, note the missing light, and think for a second (this supervisor is pretty good about not giving me bad information). Pull the printer away from the tangle of cables behind it, turn it, find the small, unmarked, round black button, press it, hear the gratifying sound of printer turning on. Watch it spit out three copies of X from earlier.

Neighboring supervisor: “I feel stupid now.”

Me: “Don’t. Even knowing exactly where the power button was, I still had to look for it, and this printer is never supposed to be turned off. I’m pretty sure someone just pushed the printer back into this tangle of cords and something pushed the power button.”

##Note
Before anyone blames the user on this one, I’ve been there two and a half years and have never seen that printer turned off before. I knew about it because I’m responsible for making sure the identical printer in our department stays working/stocked, so I turn ours off sometimes when I’m refilling it. And the button really is hidden and unmarked.",1,1632756064

1889,6 Degrees of Separated Paper,"This post was written instead of doing actual things. Apologies for the crappy title but no apologies for lack of Llamas in the story.

Once upon a time, Toshiba made a very nice dot matrix printer called the P351. 24 - count 'em - 24 pins of punchy tungsten points that enabled a huge variety of visual beauty on the printed page but was mainly just used for underlining some times. There was a colour capable version too -  the P351C but as this was the era of CGA and EGA video no one in the offices knew what colours were yet and proceeded to just wear out the black section of the ribbon.

The P351 was the pride of any office it graced for producing correspondence. And it had accessories too. The favourite one was the Automatic Sheet Feeder for loading A4 paper when a job was sent. and loading a second sheet for the second page. I won't overwhelm you with the technical detail of what occurs when a third page is sent for printing from the document. 

In these golden days of 1990 or 91, one particular P351 resplendent with ASF was matched with a fully functioning 286 with Wordperfect 5.1 which for you youngsters out there was a Word Processor. Not one of these new fangled Desktop Publishing rigs with WYSIWIG functions but, rather, a column on the left that showed how many lines of text would be sent to the printer. 66 Lines of text on your screen lined up with 66 lines of printed text on the paper.  Line 67 would be the top line of the second page.

Now we get to the tech support part. On this occasion, the customer reported the fault that a single page document would, on occasion, print the last line of a page (e.g. Line 66) as a single line at the top of a second page. I won't bore you with how long it took to see the fault let alone how long it took to test suffice to say it was a painful process. And it didn't happen if you just created your own document with 1 - 66 listed down the page. Ohhhh no, it had to be an actual letter full of words, line spaces and carriage returns slowly and noisily delivered to the A4 sheet of paper.

You are probably thinking ""well its obviously the automatic sheet feeder"" and so did I until the replacement ASF did the same thing. 

""Probably paper dust on the sensors"" you counter. There was not a spec in that device when I finished servicing and cleaning it. Even used the multimeter on the Paper Out switch to make sure it was seeing open/close reliably. Guess what? It was. The paper-out switch was mounted in a way so that a length of thin steel poked through a window and was pushed by the paper surface when present to close the switch via a lever action. ""Well that lever is bent"" you say to which I say it wasn't and also ask you stop interrupting.

Ideally the lever/thin pokey steel piece meets the surface of the paper perpendicular. There is only one screw mount so its possible for the whole switch to pivot on the screw and be at something other than a right angle. But it pokes through a window so the angle is restricted by the presence of the edge of the hole. By being on an angle, even a slight one, changes the distance ever so slightly of the end of the lever so the lower edge of the paper is being detected fractionally before it would if the lever was perpendicular. ""Adjust the switch so its straight, next story"" you rudely interject.

That's half of the story. Keep reading this one. This customer had just received 150 reams of letter head paper from a cheaper overseas supplier. A4 paper is 297 mm tall (or 11 3/4"") . This new paper was both inconsistently milled/cut for the length but also had tiny variations in the edge too so it was not perfectly straight. The printer was in spec but the paper was not.

The extra page with a single line of text did still happen but not as often as it did before the switch was aligned. And loc-tite was required to make sure it didn't move. But the issue remained as long as they continued using that paper.",1,1632620385

1898,"What the hell is a ""line square"" ?","We've all had that one user who says something simple in a weird, convoluted way... 

This one is mine, and he's a doozy.

&amp;#x200B;

""I used to have my icons pinned to squares on my screen, but I logged in today and they're all gone.""

I tried to help him pin applications to the taskbar, thinking he meant that. He didn't.

Tried to help him pin them to start menu, but he seemed genuinely surprised that the start menu existed...

&amp;#x200B;

Finally he gave me the clue that I needed: ""I used to have a line square in the middle of the screen and a regular line on the left."" 

&amp;#x200B;

...

&amp;#x200B;

Just kidding I had no idea what that meant. 

&amp;#x200B;

I eventually dragged a desktop icon to the middle of the desktop and he exclaimed ""yeah! like that!""

&amp;#x200B;

What he wanted was to drag some of his desktop icons to the middle of the desktop, and arrange them in a square. That way the apps he uses regularly are separated from the apps that have shortcuts on the desktop but that he doesn't use...

&amp;#x200B;

The ""regular line on the left"" are the unused apps, not enough for a second column, in a vertical line of icons on the left side of the desktop.

&amp;#x200B;

There's 6 apps he uses regularly, so it's not a square. It's a rectangle. Or as he likes to put it: 

""A line square""",1,1632530522
1899,"How do I get to ""Webcam Lens""?","Fairly short one but amusing nonetheless. This isn't the first time this has happened but it's definitely the most extreme example. I work in IT for a university and I can't even fathom how some of these people are supposed to be considered ""educated"".

In recent months, our new Annual PC Replacement program has gone full-swing, replacing any computers on campus older than 6 years. Primarily we've been pushing Latitude 5511 setups with docking stations. Although it's fairly common now, most laptops 6 or more years ago didn't have a physical shutter that can be used to block your webcam.

A ticket came in yesterday titled ""My Video is Not Working For Zoom Meetings"" and before I even opened it I was fairly sure I knew what the problem was going to be. So I directed her to the settings menu in Zoom and said ""Is the preview showing a gray screen, a black screen, or is it giving you an error message? Because those are 3 distinctly different issues."". Because gray would indicate it's not detecting a webcam, black would be the shutter issue, and an error would be, I dunno, a driver or something. She confirmed that it was showing a black screen.

I explained that the PHYSICAL slider to the left of her webcam needed to be opened. She could not locate any sort of slider. So I sent a picture of a 5511 with the slider circled in red and said ""It looks like a round black switch just to the left of the webcam lens as seen in the attached picture.""

...

User: ""waydeultima, I still have a black screen and no video. How do I get to web cam lens? I am on my laptop and I can get to the camera settings but it does not look like that.""

Me: ""... Go ahead and bring your laptop by our office when you get a chance.""

Me: Sure, give me a minute to get online and add me to the mtg.

Me:  What's the problem?

UBB:  Automated patching completely destroyed the Get-Money-From-The-Customer application!

Me: Completely destroyed?  Wow, that's rare.  And you had no problems with the patching in QA?

EIM:  Looks like patching QA was successful last week, no incidents were reported. 

UBB: *Blah Blah Blah*  

*""Completely Destroyed""* meant *""The App won't start, and the support team works business hours"".* I try to talk them into a rollback to the point before patching started.  After much pounding on the table by the non-technical UBB members, I give in.  First-line does a BMR.  Need I mention that the business wants to keep the call going, ""Just in Case""?

5 hours later, BMR is complete, last full backup and incremental backups are applied.  The business owner pronounces the App healthy.

UBB (the service owner, to point the finger):  **Excellent, still one hour until business begins.  We've got time to patch!**  *&lt;click&gt;, hits the button for self-service patching.*

I mute my phone and begin swearing...

20 - 30 minutes later, all 4 servers and patched and back online.  No problems.  Guess it wasn't the automated patching after all.

**If you think patching screwed up your servers, why would you restore them and then patch them?**

Bonus: Two of the servers turned out to be DEV.  Under our ground rules, the division pays less for DEV support, but can't raise emergency tickets against it.

Bonus #2:  App team thinks an app config file was corrupted on one DEV server and one PROD server.  The other two were fine, as far as they can tell.",1,1632489779

1910,sometimes simple solutions are the best,"Long, long, ago, in galaxy far, far, away.

I worked for computer company as a field tech and tier 1 support for customers by phone if needed.

My company had sold a system to a smallish college in a medium sized city in a neighboring state.  I had never been to this site, I didn't even know it existed.   This system was a small System V Unix type running on a small Motorola RISC system (at least I think that's what it was).  A handful of dumb terminals and printers were connected with RS-232 serial connections and system backups were done on a QIC-60 external SCSI tape drive.  

Problem was, their backups were failing.  I forget the exact error, I think there was a script that called cpio and dumped to the tape device.  Anyway, the support guys had sent out a replacement tape drive and the customer was reporting the same problem, so they asked me to go onsite and see if I could fix it.   

I figured I could either fly or drive, drive would be about 5 hours.  Flying would take longer since there were no direct flights, I had to fly PAST the city to the nearest hub, then fly back.   No thanks, I'd drive.

So, I called the customer, got directions, scheduled the trip, and drove out the next day.  It was fairly late by the time I got there but I knew I was spending the night anyway, so I had them show what happened.  Yes, they would stick a tape in the drive, kick off the script, and more than half the time it would fail.  They had tried different tapes, all the stuff the help desk had asked them to try.  The folks at the site were getting read to go home but I could stay since the door would lock behind me when I left (back in those innocent days).

I played around with different tapes for a while trying to see if there was a common thread to the failures, but couldn't find one.  Sometimes a tape would fail on the first try, and work on if I tried again.  The original tape drive was still there so I tried it and got similar results.    They had different brands of tapes I could try, but it didn't make a difference.  I was really scratching my head.

However, I'd been doing this type of work for a while.  In my college days I had worked in a stereo/electronics shop doing repairs and sales.  I was remembering that sometimes folks would have trouble with an audio cassette you would fast forward it, then rewind it, and it would play normally.   Same thing could happen on VCRs.   

I had never worked with a QIC-60 device before and I was not very familiar with Unix at this time, but there was a manual with the system so I found the section on tape device commands, and there was, a tape command with a retension option.  I have forgotten the actual syntax over the years, but I tried it out on the one of the problem tapes, and the backup script ran fine.  Tried a couple of more tapes, and they all worked.  So, I just edited the script to add the retension step, gave it one more test (which worked!), and headed off to dinner.

I told the help desk folks what I'd found and they added the step to the script they supplied to other sites.  This was one of the first customer to have this particular hardware and apparently they had not seen this before.",1,1632427810

1913,Power troubleshooter,"After working in some various jobs (shipping agent, sales, admin, translations...), but always being the person everyone asked for help to fix their computer, I gave up and decided to make that my job description.  I enrolled in an evening class at the university and got a job working at the internal IT help desk at a big telco. 

The people who called in were employees, all over the country. This was the mid 90's, and this telco was the main provider of telephone and internet access in the country, especially once you got out of the big cities. They had offices and stores of various sizes all over the country.

A lady called from one of the small stores in a town out in the boondocks. Her computer wouldn't turn on - she pressed the power button, and nothing happened. No light went on, no beep, no hard drive or fan noise - nothing. This was one of the computers which had a socket in the power supply that you connected the monitor to, and normally the little light on the monitor would come on as soon as you pressed the computer power button. But nothing happened here - obviously the power supply was completely broken.

I was about to send the ticket on to the nearest tech center for a site visit, which would mean a couple of hours' drive for somebody, when I got an idea.

""Before I send the tech out, let me ask you something. Do you have a desk light by any chance?""

She did.

""Is it working?""

It was.

""If you unplug the computer, and you plug the desk lamp into that power outlet, does the desk lamp still work?""

It did **not**.

""Great! You'll have to get a splitter if you want to use both the desk lamp and the computer. And call the janitor about the bad outlet.""

1921,You can not use the old desktops. Use the new ones.,"My workplace had been replacing 2014 era desktop computers with ""new"" ones.

The old desktops' specifications:

- i3 or i5 Haswell

- 8 GB RAM

- SSD

The ""new"" desktops:

- i3 Kaby Lake (2017-era CPU)

- 4 GB RAM (Removable media is banned at that workplace, so I can't use USB sticks for the ""ReadyBoost"".)

- HDD

The company also uses security products where they use more than 0.5 GB RAM and half of the HDD's disk I/O. For anyone that used Windows 10 on a HDD, you can imagine exactly how those computers run.

The new desktops often took about half an hour for them to be usable enough to load a web browser, Excel and Outlook. The old desktops only took a few minutes for the boot process, logging in, and loading those applications.

One day the new desktop was stuck loading for over an hour, and that included a restart about 15 minutes into the first loading when it displayed a black screen. I told the IT department about it and they told me to just keep waiting. They were definitely not interested in investigating the problem. I dumped that computer somewhere else and brought back the ""decommissioned"" old desktop.

Fast forward a few weeks later and IT had switched out my old desktop with the new one. And I had an email instructing me not use a decommissioned desktop again. Of course I printed out that email.

When the new desktop was stuck loading for over an hour again, I decided to just browse the internet on my phone and find other things to do, while letting IT know every half an hour or so about it being stuck loading. Every time they told me to just keep waiting. My supervisor and manager (both who had also been angry with the new computers) left me alone when I explained the instructions from IT.

Record time was about 3 hours. I pulled up task manager at the 1 hour mark. It took about 20 minutes for the lock screen to appear and another 20 minutes for task manager to finish loading. It showed the disk I/O usage was at 100%, the RAM usage was at about 95% usage, high number of compressed memory, and the CPU sitting at about 30% usage.

Even my somewhat IT-illiterate manager said ""what a pile of s***"".

The bad news is that most of the old desktops were already thrown away. The good news is that the IT department is potentially getting funds to buy new desktops, in the next fiscal quarter. No idea what the hardware specs will be though. They're still going to stick with the security products though.

But hey, why worry about ransomware when the security products make the slow computers too slow to run the malware? Good luck trying to encrypt or exfiltrate the files when the OS and the security products are trashing the HDD.",1,1632362442
1922,Why didn't you tell me that?,"I work as phone tech support. I got a CX who had some network based issue, and various other issues, most of which I wasn't able to figure out because her answer to all of my probing questions was ""it doesn't work"" and some whining. It took me a couple minutes of increasingly verbose questions just to establish the phone was still turning on. So a fun one. 

I establish after some more questions her phone is not on wifi and get her to tap on the network. It prompts for a password. This spawns a discussion of her insisting that it doesn't have a password and that she never typed in a password and that no one set up her phone and typed it in, etc. Eventually I convince her to go downstairs and read the side of her router. 

She gets downstairs, and immediately insists there's no password. I get her to read it off and suddenly there's a password that she starts reading off to me. I advise her I don't need to know it and just type it into the phone. She then tells me she left the phone upstairs for some reason and was annoyed I didn't tell her to bring the phone with her to the router. 

(Side note I was previously given a dissatisfied survey by another customer for giving overly precise instructions)

After she goes back upstairs to get the phone and type it in, it doesn't take the password. The customer winds up hanging up on me because she had convinced herself that the phone manufacturer (my company) had broken her phone because she had looked up the the new line of models last night.

""Well I can understand where you're coming from with that unfortunate timing, but if you just get the Wi-Fi password we can get your phone back to normal""

1924,Word to the unwise,"I'm old enough that when I was in school, the term ""IT"" didn't really exist. DOS did exist, but Windows was barely windowed. Most places ran their stuff on mainframes, and having a PC at home was uncommon. 

Still, no matter what my actual job title was at a given place of employment, I always fell into the role of ""Speaker to Tech"". For a few years in the mid 90's, I worked as a translator of non-fiction, mostly manuals of every product under the sun. One of my  clients was the Chamber of Commerce; they helped smaller companies get access to foreign markets so they had a list of translators they'd send documents to for translation. I got a small job at first so they could see how I did.

When I came to deliver the document - Internet wasn't exactly ubiquitous at the time, so hand delivery was common - I chatted a while with my contact there, and mentioned my habit of fixing people's computers. She immediately pounced. ""We've got this one PC that makes funny noises when we boot it, and then stuff doesn't work properly. It started after one of the guys tried to fix {some issue that I can't remember}, but he never got it to work. I've asked a tech but the helpdesk didn't have any idea and they take ages to send a tech out. If you're not in a hurry, maybe you could look at it?"" I wasn't so I did.

She booted the thing, which, yes made various funny noises. Think an 80's TV game -beep boop boppity beep boop. It was supposed to start Windows, but all it showed was a DOS prompt. I could start Windows by typing the full path though, so that was something - the machine wasn't entirely trashed. 

Once there, I started Word, since that was the program she really needed the computer for. It worked, so that was good. My client would be able to use the computer until the tech made time for her. Still, I really wanted to know what had made it misbehave. On these old boxes, the first thing you do is look at autoexec.bat, so I opened that file in Notepad.

It was full of garbage.

More specifically, it was full of information about fonts, templates, and other stuff that Word puts into Word files.

Yep. The guy who'd tried to help with whatever the issue was had also known to start with autoexec.bat. Only he hadn't opened it in Notepad - he'd used Word. And then he'd saved the file as a Word file.

All I needed to do was open the file in Word again and ask Word to save it as a pure text file.

And that is how I ended up on the list of favoured translators and got a lot more work from the Chamber of Commerce.",1,1632331817
1925,Dead Powerbook and the nervous professor,"Sometimes in tech support you can look like a hero without really doing anything difficult.

Years ago when I worked at a University we had a lot of professors get excited about Apple Powerbooks.  They liked the look, the metal case, the Unix-y feel of OSX, it was so \*cool\*.  And we bought a bunch of them.   And as super smart users tend to do, they didn't think much about backups.  We had no kind of Enterprise network solution, we told them to buy an external disk and use Timemachine.  Or rsync from the laptop to our fancy file server.  I investigated Retrospect but no one wanted to pay for it.

And then one day Professor C came hustling into my office with an old Powerbook.  

C:  ""This laptop is dead and it has some important files on it.  Can you help?""

Me:  ""Maybe, what's wrong?""

C:  ""The screen never comes on, I don't know its powering up.   I tried a different power adapter but the screen is still blank""

Me:  ""Did you try an external monitor?""

C: ""Oh.  No, I didn't think of that""

For some context, C was a computer guy, but he was more in theory end of things, he could probably do his job with a pencil and notebook.   So, I hook up a monitor, nothing.  Power LED is on so it seems to be not totally dead.   Connect an external keyboard and mouse just to see if that makes any difference.   

Me:   ""I think you're right, its dead Jim.  Do you have any backups?""

C looks kind of nervous.  Like there's something he doesn't want to tell me, but figures he's going to have to.

C:  ""Actually, this my OLD laptop, my wife's been using it for her business and its got all her important files on it.   And she doesn't have any backups"".

OK, so this is interesting.   Its certainly not proper for me to use my time to recover his wife's files.   But C is a nice guy and I can see he's sweating bullets.   I sure would not want to tell my wife her business files are gone.  I'm about to tell him he'll have to take it to a repair place to get the drive pulled out, maybe the data can be recovered from there.   But then I have another thought.

Me:  ""Do you have your current laptop with you?""

C: ""Yes"".  Pulls a newer Powerbook out of his backpack.

I grab a firewire cable and connect the two laptops.  I explain to C about ""target mode"" for Apple computers.  I boot up the broken laptop in target mode and his good laptop sees it.

Me:  ""You can copy files to your laptop from the bad one.   And get your wife to buy an external drive to make backups on"".  

To myself I'm thinking, and get her her buy a reliable computer for ""her business""!  For crying out loud, using this old POS was just asking for trouble.

C was super grateful.  He thanked me over and over again.   He couldn't believe I had this secret way to access his dead laptop (it was pretty silly, I just used a utility that the Apple guys had included, its not like I invented anything).

The strangest thing was I had another professor in a different department have the exact same situation come up a week later.  He was another super cool guy and he was just in next building over, so I just strolled across with my Firewire cable and got to be a hero all over again.",1,1632330034

The process was to create the video and send it to the Salesperson.  They will then compile all the videos and send to Mr. X on his birthday.  I made my video, did a few edits then sent the Salesperson an email with the link to my video.  

I then received an email back from the salesperson asking me to text her the link so that she could have it on her phone.  The eyebrow-raising part was that her email asking me to text her the link so she could have it on her phone said ""Sent from my iPhone"" at the bottom.

I asked him what he would have told himself 15 years ago knowing what he knows now. He said he would have done the same. So I know I can’t ask questions here but I was curious would you looking back on your schooling taking computer information systems, networking or cyber security?",1,1632277071
1931,Tech support is awesome - I forgot my password and pin,"This is going to be a different type of TFTS post. I've posted here prior, and like most other posts, just flat out rage or rag on the caller's lack of sense.

Well, this time, tech support is calling tech support, and have to say, we're really awesome when we call tech support - because we get it, and we'll work with you to get this resolved. Anyways, the story.

I bought my laptop almost 2 years ago, and at the time set up my access via password, pin and fingerprint. Well, throughout this time, I've always been using my finger to login to the laptop. 

Recently, my friend had an accident which caused her finger to not be read by her phone, which caused constant issues when unlocking as the phone kept reading as wrong fingerprint or press harder, or whatever. Well, I thought that could happen to me, and so I tried using my password and pin. Unfortunately, I've forgotten what they are. I tried being tech support and trying various means to recover or change local windows password to no avail
- reset pin requires password
- no security questions were created
- tried various old passwords
- tried replacing local account with MS account, but that needed local password

Finally I gave up and called tech support. Explained the situation, the steps I've taken and some trouble shooting. Gave remote access and we worked our way around to figure  out a fix - create a new admin account, use the old version of control panel to change the other admin password. Interaction took less than 20 minutes considering creating the admin account and just verifying and trying all other possibilities.

In short, tech support works best if you let tech support do their thing👌",1,1632250491
1932,Helped an older friend make a word document… they had trouble with basic file recognition.,"I helped an older family friend make a letter head.

I embedded an image in the email text body showing what it should look like with a brief description (since word is weird and likes to mess with image formatting between different versions)  and then attached the word document like normal to the email.

I get an angry/confused phone call 10mins later - “I can’t edit it? It’s opened in some weird program! Help!”

I’m feeling a bit confused since they should at least be able to edit it in word, even if the formatting was weird…  

After a little bit of troubleshooting, I worked out they had saved the image,  thinking it was the document and was confused as to why they couldn’t add text to it…

I had to very slowly and carefully redirect them back to the email to save and open the correct file, which was fine of course.",1,1632195257
1933,high risk,"so i came up on my primary duty alone for the first time. i'd had a four hour training session with my boss.  he was an excellent trainer, i had a ton of confidence in him. so as i prepared the thruster for this vibration test, i realized i could not find the three mil-spec bolts.

 i needed to bind the $750,000 100 pound thrust apogee rocket engine to the magnesium mount i had already bound to the vibration machine (think giant pissed off bass driver) with dozens of quarter-inch bolts.

  the thing about this 100 pound thruster that weighs about ten pounds, if it works as sold, customer would earn $15 billion via their big fat com sattelite over the next 15 years.  i'm looking at 15 billion dollars, and the folks that hired me for this task have a perfect flight record. no in flight failure, ever. they built 100 pound engines for Apollo, 25 pound and 900 pound for Shuttle, hundreds of Geostationary engines.  

they are the very best.  and now i had to call boss and ask about the three bolts i could not find.  took me 5 different job applications across 20 years, three in the last year, to earn this job. i had found a way to work with my heroes. now i expected to be fired.  my job was to protect the thruster from the many dangers of vibration testing. i failed step one.  boss was tight and true, never heard him shout, always calm and cool and magnificent in his leadership.

we got our hands on three bolts good enough, passed vibe, and continued the legacy",1,1632193983

1937,Almost fits...,"The story of ""But it fits"" reminded me of one I experienced.


Many moons ago I worked copy/print and we had a large format color printer.  A big HP inkjet that could print on 36"" wide rolls of paper.  This printer took 4 ink cartridges, CMYK and it had two different ink systems.  One for regular ink, great for printing on paper and UV ink, great for banners and such that'd be exposed to the sun.  The ink cartridges were big, about 10"" long, 1.5"" wide and 5"" tall.  On the back of each cartridge was two metal and rubber ports where they would plug into the feed lines to the print heads. Most importantly they were keyed at the bottom, each color and type had a different plastic notch.  To swap ink systems you had to open the back of the machine up, flip some latches and the entire ink system from cartridge slots to print head holder came out.  You can see where this is going already.

While I was on vacation two of the guys I worked with decided to swap out one ink set for another.  I can't recall why, it's well over a decade ago.  When the cartridges didn't fit they forced them in.  This of course meant the two ports didn't line up properly, plastic was snapped and the machine apparently leaked a good amount of ink out of it.  So the Help Desk was engaged, it's determined that the part is broken and a new one will be sent out at the location's cost.  Everything is agreed upon by management.  This all happens before I return from vacation.

Here's where it becomes MY tech support issue.  I get back, I'm told why the machine is broken and what is being done to repair it.    So I keep an eye on things, waiting for the tech to show up or for the machine to be fixed when I come in one day.  A few weeks go by, each week I contact our Help Desk who looks up our ticket, sees that they've contacted HP and says they'll follow up. Now my manager is getting upset because we're turning away work or sending it out to another location so we're losing a cut of the money.  I call the Help Desk again and get the ""We'll follow up."" answer again.  I relay the info to the manager, who then emails the District Manager (the DM had been in the loop since week 2) and the Regional Manager.

The next day I get a call from HP, they apologize for the delay.  Something went wrong on their end and they lost the order or something like that.  As they've now blown past the SLA for the repair they're sending a tech out tonight.  The tech is going to go to the airport to pick up a replacement part and drive to our location to install it.  I can't remember what the SLA was but I know our service was weekdays, normal business hours.  I believe to make up for the error they also dropped the charges for the repair and replacement parts.

Sure enough about an hour later I get a call from a tech verifying that we'd be around to let him in.  I let him know we're a 24/7 business, someone will be here for him.  He showed up around 7pm with the box for the replacement ink system and some parts.  He had come up from Orange County (we were in Los Angeles) and he proceeded to take our machine apart, clean up the mess inside, replace the broken parts and install the new ink system.",1,1632181493
1938,What OU is the local admin account in?,"First time post, a short one.

TLDR: System engineer called tech support to ask what OU the local admin account was in.

Details:

A couple of months ago, one of our classrooms was repurposed as a lounge (Instructors/Sailors needed a place to relax), and all the computers were removed. Fast forward two months, and the instructors realized the remaining classrooms were insufficient for all the training ongoing, so all the computers need to go back.

Thankfully, my boss supported me when I indicated that the tech support office shouldn't be involved with the effort, since the repurposed classroom was never contractually our problem (US military contracts are odd beasts), so the In-Service Engineering Office was detailed to put the classroom back together. 

We never shut off the switch ports for the room, so this should be easy, right? Right... A couple of the machines wouldn't come back on the network, because one of the engineers didn't bother to read the labels on the hard drives and ensure the workstations were connected back to the same switch port (and we are using Sticky MAC).

Senior engineer drops by to tell me they can't get a couple of the systems on the network. I ask if he logged on to check connectivity, etc. He responds that he can't log on, so he can't check connectivity. 

Me: With local admin? 

Engineer: I don't know the local logon.

Me: Local admin is &lt;redacted&gt;, password should be &lt;redacted&gt;

Engineer: Okay, I'll try that.

1942,Flying Pigs,"As mentioned in my previous posts I’m not actually tech support but the de facto tech support because I can plug a usb plug into the right port.

Today I was trying to login to a website we use which had been down all weekend.  I go to the login page and see that it’s still down, which is odd because it’s common for them to be down for maintenance over the weekend but not on a Monday.

I cuss the site first off all which attracts the owner’s attention, just as I think maybe I need to clear the browsers cache as this has happened before.  The owner looking over my shoulder mentions that it’s odd that they’re down as he’s logged on earlier.  This is a guy who’s not the best tech person and often requires help, it’s an ongoing joke between us, and I even think he’s cursed as some tech only fails when’s he’s around.  Then he says “Maybe you need to clear your cache.” I’m gobsmacked that not only does he know what a cache is, he’s got the correct solution.

I stand up, run out of the building and start looking up at the sky.

The young lady who readies The Kraken in another of my posts filled me in on the next bit.

Her, the owner, and several work colleagues watch me rush out the door.  Unlike everyone else who’s just looking at me run out, The Kraken Lady brings up the door camera view on the big screen.
“Huh, I guess you had the right answer then,” she tells the owner.
“How do you know that? What is he doing?”
I’ve just started walking back in the building.
“He’s looking for the flying pigs.” She knows me so well.

As I walk back in the door, the owner causally asks me “Did you find those flying pigs?”
Me, trying to keep a straight face, “More than I expected.”

1943,"You need wifi to connect to the server, and a wifi dongle isn't a USB storage device, honest.","This happened a while ago. How long? not going to say.. What industry? Not going to say. But the entirety of the office's existence is generating TPS reports and writing checks and or sending direct deposits. It's not payroll... it's TPS reports.. and the checks arn't payroll checks, they are... for recalled.. erm.. party balloons?

The pay for this well.. Bit show? Is remarkably good.

We are under tents and set up on folding tables. Screw you covid for forcing us outdoors.

&amp;#x200B;

7:30 AM on a day that ended in Y.

&amp;#x200B;

""OK everyone, if your not set up and good to write reports, PRINT the signed payment agreements please let me know so I can help you get set up"".

&amp;#x200B;

I help a few people get logged on and help folks get setup, diagnose an unplugged power strip ect. Wow what do you know I have time to go get a coffee.

&amp;#x200B;

8:00 am rolls around and the first angry customers shows up to get their recalled balloon checks.

&amp;#x200B;

I get the first Irate customer at my desk and I start to work on his TPS report.

&amp;#x200B;

""Can i get some help I can't upload my TPS report"" Q asks everyone. I know it's intended to be asking me for help. To put some of this in context Q is somewhere in age between my dad who retired 5 years ago and my long dead grandfather in age.

&amp;#x200B;

""I'm filling out Mr. Smith's TPS report, pass the customer over to someone else and give me 5 minutes and i'll come help""

&amp;#x200B;

So I finish Mr. Smith's TPS report and get up to look at Qs computer. I hit the giant link on his desktop for the web app to import TPS reports and... no joy... no internet. I look at his network and.. no network connection.

&amp;#x200B;

Le joy...

I go into it and... no wireless networks available.

?

&amp;#x200B;

So the next thing I do is start looking for the idiot switch for switching off the wifi, i've seen that issue before, heck i've done that more times than I can count and it's an honest mistake.

&amp;#x200B;

Yeah this ancient crapbox doesn't seem to have an idiot switch. I go into device manager to look for a wireless card driver issue....

&amp;#x200B;

AND... no wireless devices... period.. none zip nada.

I push out a quick email to the boss. ""Hey Boss... Qs computer won't work out here without a wifi dongle""

""You've spent enough time trying to get qs uploader to work, just get back to work and let tech support *Team view* his computer""

&amp;#x200B;

""Oh..Kay?""

&amp;#x200B;

So I call next in line in the Socially distanced bull pen of a queue of POed customers and start taking down his information for the party balloon warranty and start filling in the TPS report.

&amp;#x200B;

After about *half an hour* of tech support trying to help Q get teamviewer working he finally gets the all clear to go into the building with the computer to walk to IT and get them to look at the computer.

&amp;#x200B;

About 10 minutes later Q comes back and sits down with his computer. He plugs in a wifi dongle and starts his laptop up. He takes the next angry customer in line and gets to work... surprisingly everything runs well for about an hour.

&amp;#x200B;

The supervisor walks up and says ""What the heck are you doing Q, no USB storage allowed for any reason, these computers have sensitive balloon warranty information on them"" and she pulls the wifi dongle out.

""I'm just using what IT told me to use to fix it?"" Q tells her.

""IT knows the rules, IT made the rules.. this is a serious breach""

I decide to open a giant can of worms and remind the supervisor of a certain policy..

""Don't you have to have him escorted to cybersec and HR on a first offense due to the sensitive nature of the customer data on the TPS reports?"" (who knew that party balloon warranties were so sensitive of documents?)

1946,bigboss and the almost new laptop,"I had an earlier post about $bigboss and email.   I have a few stories about this person, not all are strictly technical so I'm not sure if the fall within the thread moderator rules.  This one is, I'm pretty sure.

At this point $bigboss had rotated out of the Dept Chairperson role, but was still on the faculty and recognized as a ""high maintenance"" user.  He would rarely submit tickets, he'd either email me directly, call me, or show up in my office wanting help NOW.  This time, he emailed.

Basically he said his laptop was running slow and he was worried something was wrong with it.  Could I come by and look?

We didn't actually care about ticket metrics at this point, a lot of requests were generated in a similar way it was mostly ok.   I replied that I'd be happy to look, when would a good time be?  He was in his office right now so . . .  I popped down the hall to see him.

He had his laptop, a Powerbook, sitting on his desk, and starts showing me, at warp speed, what the problem is.  He's clicking his mouse every two seconds flipping from window to window, app to app, and saying ""see?  see?  its slow!   There is some lag while he indulging in this clicking frenzy, the screen is refreshing so fast I can't follow what he's doing.   

I take a deep breathe, can I try a few things?  He lets go of the mouse and I start slowly clicking through all the things he has open.  There's a ton.  Several browser windows, Office, text window, pdf viewer, and then I hit something I've never seen before, its a window with a bunch of graphs that seems to be constantly refreshing, like its streaming.   What's this?  Its a program that shows him real time stock pricing info, he uses it for day trading.  

I start looking at the resources being used using the regular old system monitor stuff from Apple.  The machine has the minimal memory offered and he's using it all.  I'm guessing there's some swapping going on as he feverishly clicks around.  Plus this streaming is a memory hog according to the monitor.  When did this slowness start, last week.  By chance is that when he installed the streaming price thing?  No, wait, yes, er, maybe?  

I explain he probably needs to upgrade memory but it may be easier to just get a new laptop.  I know for a fact that he has lots of funding from various grants, but he is also VERY cheap.   He says the laptop isn't that old, he shouldn't have to replace it.  How old is it?  A year, maybe two.  I'm looking at it and thinking no way.  I click on the ""About this Mac"" tab, its over 4 years old.   He doesn't believe it.  I'm telling him I could look it up the property database and find out when it was purchased but that's beside the point, doesn't he want a faster machine?  We should order one with the memory maxed out.  Yes, I'll be happy to get him a quote. 

I get him a quote and we go back and forth about much it costs.   We buy a lot of Apple stuff they should give us a better price.   They already do, it called Education pricing, and no, our Department is way too small of a customer to get better pricing.  He's kind of sulky but finally agrees to what I've proposed.   For context, most users would send me a completed config for a laptop and I would just get it ordered.  

Anyway, I got his new laptop and install all the stuff he wanted, bunch of stuff from macports, and migrated his various files (yes, most users could do this themselves).   And he had to install his magic stock pricing thing since was clearly not related to University business.  

At the end of day it was kind of frustrating since the original problem was caused by his ""incidental use"", and all the angst about buying a new laptop when he had plenty of money to buy one and he used it a zillion hours a day.   But I realized that if the University wanted to pay me to listen to folks whine about how expensive computers are, that's OK, it was clear my time was considered ""free"".",1,1631988937

1950,Please increase my mailbox size to 1 Exabyte ...,"Just had a funny support ticket yesterday.

Normal users get a mailbox size of 500 MiB. For normal usage that's enough. You're not supposed to abuse the mail system as *""archiving""* solution - we have a separate product for that.

But thanks to the current pandemic it can happen that some users might get a lot more mail traffic than others and might thus run out of space pretty fast (e.g. because of attachments and what not). So if that happens a user can open a ticket and request more space, e.g. 1 GiB or 2 GiB if need be which we will happily provide.

And then yesterday we get this ticket from a user who thinks she's particularly entitled to having a super duper large mailbox. :-)

***""Please increase my mailbox size to 1 Exabyte!""***

So we call her back, thinking that maybe that's just a typo and she actually meant *1 Gigabyte* ...

***""NO!! I really mean 1 Exabyte!!""***   she insists :))

***""I need all the mailbox space you can give me!! I am sooo tired of constantly running out of space ...""***

*""Constantly""* ???  Ticket history shows that she's only had her mailbox size increased once so far: from 500 MiB to 800 MiB. And that was like 1 year ago. Storage analysis shows she's got like 750 MiB in her mailbox now. So given the growth rate of her mailbox over the past year 1 GiB should do just fine for her. If she runs out of that space too she can request 2 GiB in about a year or so ...

(BTW, fellow sysadmins:  BS like this is *exactly* why you don't do zip and anything at all unless there's a ticket ID for it!!!  Document everything and make sure it's in the ticket !!)

1957,We’ll go through a LOT for the Money,"Y’all might hate this story because it is from the other side of the conversation,  but hopefully it will be allowed as a great story.

During the recent pandemic there were several opportunities for our business to receive government assistance, and being a fan of free money I pursued them all, including one from our government. 

Applying was easy, the only hard work was rounding up and scanning all of the supporting documents. Once the application was filed, I received an email instruction to log into “the portal” and complete an additional step of submitting another form giving permission to access our tax returns. 

I referred to my helpful notes for email and password and tried to log into “the portal”. I received an error message that I was locked out due to multiple inaccurate login attempts. Trying the reset password link led to a server error. I called the tech support number and spoke to “Dave” who suggested clearing browser memory and cache and trying again. So I did that. No luck. I called back and spoke with “Summer”. She suggested using a different browser entirely. Again no luck. In my third call to “Heather”, she suggested using a new browser, clearing memory and cache, and WAITING FOUR HOURS before trying again. At this point I figured she was not working the next day. Heather also said she would make a note in the file so if I called again my problem could escalated to IT. I asked could we already go to the IT department and she said no, they are kind of slow and it might take a week. 

There was a deadline to complete the application and it was just a few days away. I emailed for assistance and received the following tips:
 
“Connect your device to a different Wi-Fi network.  

Try using Wi-Fi if none is being used.

Try using a mobile device connected to a cellular network, without Wi-Fi.

On a mobile device, toggle “airplane mode” on for two minutes, then toggle it back.

Stop using a public internet connection/or use a different public internet connection.

Discontinue using a VPN or start using one.

Do not use a cell phone to access the portal”

The next day I called the support number again. I spoke with Kevin. I gave the short version of my troubles and asked to be upgraded to the IT department. His helpful reply,

“We don’t have an IT department”.

In the end I visited a friend in a different State and was able to login and complete the application. We got the money.",1,1631916754

1960,"What ""Browse"" button? I don't see a ""Browse"" button!","A long long time ago, back when Windows 95 was new and current, I worked the help desk at a local computer retailer.

I'd regularly get calls from people who couldn't figure out how to install drivers or whatnot, and I'd walk them through it on the phone.

One day, I got a call from a guy who needed to install drivers for a new card he'd just bought. I don't recall what, exactly, I think a video card.

The computer has booted up and it wants a driver. The dialogue box automatically comes up. I tell him to click the ""Browse"" button in the bottom right corner of the box. He insists there's no ""Browse"" button.

I at first figure that he must be at a different stage of things, and so I'm racking my memory for what the various stages of these dialogue boxes look like, and asking him to verify. Each one is a no.

I explicitly describe the dialogue box that I expect to him - everything matches up, except ""there's no Browse button!""

Finally I give up and tell him that he'll need to bring it in and pay us our service fee of $50 to install drivers for you.

Suddenly, he says ""oh, you mean *this* Browse button?""

The most shocking ones are calls about ""error"" notifications. Ones where its not an error message, just an alert and the user either chooses to do what it says or not do what it says. Something literally as simple as ""read A, do B or C"". The calls usually go something like this:

""I'm getting an error message and don't know what to do""

""What does the message say?""

""It says 'to proceed, select yes. Select no to return to the previous screen""

"".....and what would you like to do?""

1963,"Used to be a laptop warranty repair tech, fubar","Normal day at work and boss hands me a bin with a laptop in it, laughing.

The bin had water in the bottom of it and the laptop was bent in a U shape mildly.  The box it was shipped in was included.  The laptop still had residual water dripping from it.  

The customer sent it in for repair/replacement with a note in the box.

""Dear Repair Tech,

I am sure you are wondering what happened to this laptop, so I included this note.  I am a writer and my quiet place I go to is a bridge back in the woods.  I was writing with the laptop in my lap and sitting on the bridge when it slipped and went into the creek below.  I got down and pulled it from the creek, and tossed it up on the bridge.  About that tim a truck came through and ran over it.  I sent it in as is with this note.  Thanks for the new laptop in advance.""

The company I repaired for had an option for a no fault no questions asked repair or replacement plan.  Luckily this customer bought it.  It would cover full replacement if you bought it new, walked outside and stomped it.

1964,Clueless Manager,"A few years ago now we had a new manager start in the Sales department. I will call her Tracey. She'd been in post a few weeks when we get a request from her for some new software. This was very specialised CRM software (these were the days when CRM was the latest buzz word on the block). It cost a fortune, had questionable reviews and above all, looking at the sales blurb, needed several weeks of expensive training before you could use it. Anyway, I took the request to my manager who agreed with me that this was not a good fit with our organisation, so he called Tracey and tried to talk her out of it. She refused to listen and demanded that we purchase it as it was ""vital to the continuing health of the company"" . We were still very reticent but she said she would bear the cost out of her own budget so we reluctantly agreed. 

Fast forward a few weeks, the package arrives on several DVDs. I read the installation instructions and immediately realise that it's going to take a whole day to install this piece of crap. I call her to arrange a time to do it, warning her that it will probably take all day. She says she's too busy and it will have to be done out of hours. I inform my manager and he tells her OK but she must pay the overtime out of her budget. She agrees to this so I go in on a Saturday and install the software. It was. B***h! Anybody remember installing Novell NetWare from a bunch of floppies? Well it was like that. I finally got it all done and running, but couldn't test it as I have said it needed a training course. So I closed it down and went home.

Monday morning comes, I go up to seel her and tell her it's installed. I was quite interested in seeing exactly what she was going to use it for. So I clicked on the icon and the opening page came up. He first words to me were ""Great! Now show me what it does and how I use it""

I was flabbergasted! She'd spent all this money on some software that she'd read about in a magazine somewhere then gave the impression she was an ""expert"". 

The result was the software was never used as she'd blown her budget buying it and couldn't afford the training courses. She left a few months later.",1,1631870535
1965,Can you fix the Excel sheet?,"This happened right before the pandemic started when I was Tech II on helpdesk.  I work for a fairly large hotel/casino, and we have hundreds of employees who ""do not use computers for their jobs"" but also have to use computers every day during their hours at work.  And a lot of them are not, eh, tech savvy, in the least.

For example the table games dealers, who at the end of their shifts use a shared computer that is secured behind the cage to enter their tips, which tells them how much they get to take home, how much is owed in tax from it, and how much they have to put into the shared dealer tip pot.  They accomplish this nifty feat with... The Excel Sheet™.

One day as I'm out on the floor as the only tech on duty (Tech II? More like Tech I-IV) and the cell phone rings.  I answer, and a kindly sounding man who barely spoke English informed me slowly that the Excel sheet was wrong.  ""It's wrong?""  ""Not putting the right numbers"" he says.  ""Okay, I'll come take a look.""

Now of course it is an I.T. problem and the I.T. department supports such common desktop software and I'm even moderately proficient with Excel however there is one problem, and that is that the I.T. department, at least the helpdesk, has no access whatsoever to these files which are both financial and gaming board related, and I had never seen this particular document before in my life.

On Arrival:  I can see the PC behind the access controlled door, however I see nobody near it.  I shrug, dismiss my security escort, and head back to the office. Time spent: 5 min.

Five Minutes Laytairrr:  Desk phone rings.  It's the cage.  This time another gentleman, far less gruntled than the first, asks why I.T. hasn't fixed The Excel Sheet™ yet.  ""Ah, when I showed up there was nobody there."" ""Yeah well I'm here now.""  ""Okay, if you can tell me the asset number on the white sticker on the computer I can remote in and take a look right now."" He gives me the number and I tell him to click yes when he sees the prompt and then I'll take over control of the computer. He asks me if he has to stay on the phone because he has to go and he's already late.  I tell him I can take it from there.  We hang up, and the madness begins.

The 2013 5400RPM i3 ProDesk creaked to life as it was asked to do the first thing other than Excel calculations since the Windows 10 upgrade. Display black.... Boink, it loads. Aha, an Excel sheet.  It's complex, a mess (I later came to learn that some smart guy in the games department made it many years ago and they've just been making copy after copy ever since).  In the few seconds I had before chaos struck, I couldn't really even discern definite input cells or output cells, however several had errors or were something akin to $1.0822294e12.  I click on a cell and am deciphering the formula to trace back what the hell is going on when suddenly a delete key is struck and the cell vanishes. **100** enters a ghost.

I furiously CTRL-Z and try to click out but now the ghost hand is moving the mouse!  Between our movements averaged a random cell, the ghost hand clicks! Another number being randomly entered!  The ghost takes over again at which point I stop fighting and am watching in awe.  The ghost selects what I'm pretty sure to be an output cell, due to it containing a rather long and complex formula, and astonishingly just pounds over it with **62** and presses enter.  Several cells go red, errors pop up all over the page.  I can no longer watch, this situation is beyond hope.

With a powerful thrust I force control of the mouse up and out of the shadow session and pound the X, and then I just sat there for a moment staring at my desktop pondering on what I had just witnessed. The sheer lack of concern, the data violence, the awesome power of having no fucking idea what you're doing or what is even going on and pounding away anyway.  I didn't even have time to call down and yell ""Stop! Stop! Please stop, it's already dead!""

I wrote a brief and relatively kind ticket up under the name of the games manager that evening that suggested they work with games admin to replace that copy, as there was nothing I.T. could do to unfuck that pig, and also strongly advised at least basic Excel training for their dealers, even if all it was was having a dealer more proficient do it with them a few times.  Time spent: 30 minutes for the small part of me that died inside.

In the end, I'm not mad, I'm not traumatized, it was like seeing something so much bigger than you that it was kind of humbling.  It was so disappointing that I was truly impressed, and I don't think I'll ever forget that experience, of watching from the driver's seat as the car crashed, over and over again.",1,1631843874
1966,"""Make me a database""","LTL,FTP and so forth.

This happened way back when I was in high school, loooong before I ever considered getting into computers or IT, so I'm surprised I even remember it, but now that I'm trying to learn Access, this little story floated to the surface of my consciousness.

It was the summer of 2003, and I was at a summer program for blind students meant to teach job skills. The first week was just workshops, and the rest of the program was an actual off-site job with actual paychecks.

I wanted, and was initially offered, a data entry position at a run-of-the-mill office, but this one girl who was slated to work at a daycare really wanted that office job, so I agreed to switch with her. That's when I realized I wasn't good with kids, but that's not what this story is about. During the first week, the instructor/councilor/whoever was assigning tasks to kids based on their interests. I think the aim of the exercise was about following instructions and interacting with management or something. Anyway, here’s how it went down to the best of my memory:

Boss: “What do you like to do?”

Random girl (not the one I switched jobs with): “I like making databases”

Boss: “Very good. Make me a database.”

Girl: “Cool, uh, what kind of database? What do you want to organize?”

Boss: “Just make me a database.”

Girl: “I really need more info before…”

Boss: “I’m sure you know what to do.”

Decades later when I switched careers and got an IT job, that little interaction became a source of great enlightenment for me. As for the rest of my time at that summer program, I suffered for over a month in that daycare, but you better believe I spent all that money on a GameCube and a bunch of games. 

PS: because I know people will ask: If you’re wondering how a blind guy can use a GameCube, learn MS Access, or even type on a computer, I highly \*highly\* encourage you to head over to /r/blind. Look around and ask questions.",1,1631837216
1967,System admin hates printers,"In this story I'm tech-supporting myself.  I hope that's allowed here.  (Don't worry, the story still contains the required idiot).

I need to print a copy of an invoice to give the bookkeeper so she can tell me when the check comes in for a VOIP system we are going to set up.  No problem, I send the pdf through pdf2ps and pipe that to lpr on my freebsd box.  That works 90+% of the time.

Make the 100-step walk to the printer.  Nothing in the output tray.  This printer is very fast, so the job is always done by the time I walk over to it.  Maybe someone picked up my job by mistake?  Go back, print it again.  Make the walk.  No output.

Ok, sometimes pdf2ps produces something the printer doesn't like.  Sometimes it prints an error page, sometimes it silently eats it.  I try the same thing again making extra sure I haven't  typo'd something.  Make the walk.  No output.

Ok, try a different pdf, one I know I printed last week.  Make the walk.  No output.

Check the printer's paper tray, toner level, turn it off and on again for good measure.  Restart lpd on the freebsd box.  Try again, make the walk, no output.

Print from a linux box.  Make the walk, no output.

Print from a Mac, which works 99.99% of the time, no output.

Ok, back to basics.  Since all the printer supplies seem good, let's print a test page.  It fires up and prints the test page in record speed.  **And shoots it right out the back onto the floor.**   On top of 20 other print jobs.

TL;DR someone opened the rear output path on a printer so all the print jobs went onto the floor.  Next task: turn the paper shredder 90 degrees so it can just catch them all as they are produced.",1,1631835841

Anything outside what our SLA states gets escalated to that user's company's Tier 2)

User: Um, hi, I'm having trouble with \[software\]. I was on the VPN, got kicked out, logged back in, and now I can't access the application. Can you help me?

Me: Certainly. It sounds like it could be a network password issue. \[check AD, password just changed 2 weeks ago\] I see you just changed your password recently. Did you happen to use winter, spring, summer, fall, autumn, password, or welcome in your password?

User: I used ""fall"", but it let me back into the system, so \[software\] should still be letting me in. I need you to get me into \[software\].

Me: I understand, however, ""fall"" is a blacklisted password \[goes into spiel about why it's blacklisted--top 7 words in English according to Google and Microsoft, yadda yadda yadda\]. Usually around the 2-3 week mark, the server does an assessment of sorts and when it catches a blacklisted password, it starts kicking you out of the VPN and any other network app. It will--

User: But I'm still in the network! Just please, get me back into \[software\].

Me: Okay, but without a password reset, I'll have to escalate you to Tier 2 so they can poke around and see what else might be happening. However, since you were booted from the VPN, that tells me it's a password issue. 

User: It is NOT a password issue...

\[Repeat this password 3 more times, with her refusing to change her password because she's currently in the network, and also refusing to be escalated.\]

Me: Okay, so let me put it this way: today, you get booted from the network but it lets you back in temporarily. Without a password change, you're going to have your account locked by the server on a weekly basis for the next few weeks. After that time, the server will not permit you access to the network. 

User: Fine! \[doubtful tone of voice but lets me know she's just humoring me\] Let's go ahead and change my password. But I'm telling you it's not going to work...

\[I guide her through changing the password. She tries to login to that software immediately without waiting for my instructions to sync her machine to the network.\]

User: See! I told you--

Me: \[ignoring her interrption\] Okay, so the password is changed. Now you need to lock your computer, then unlock it using your new password. \[Software\] should let you in after that.

1971,The Leonard Activity Reporting Tool or how I solved my bosses terrible communication skills,"Years ago I got my first junior sysadmin job at a small academic department at a university. I have since moved on to greater things, but my former boss Leonard still finds occasion to e-mail me.    

I came back from lunch today to find the following e-mail from Leonard:     
&gt; Hey, I keep finding this script ""lart.sh"" everywhere. It says you're the author. What is it? Can I get rid of it?     

Uh oh.     
See, Leonard was incompetent. And the most irritating aspect of his incompetency was his utter inability to communicate. In particular, he had a habit of making breaking configuration changes on servers I was responsible for, then asking me to troubleshoot them, while withholding the fact that he had made any changes.     

So I wrote LART, the Leonard Activity Reporting Tool. LART would query auditd, the linux security event logging daemon, and generate a tidy report showing his recent logins, what commands he had run, and whether he had modified any configuration files. LART quickly became an invaluable tool in my repertoire. Every time he asked me to troubleshoot a problem, my first step was to run LART and see what kind of fuckery Leonard had been up to recently.    

Obviously I couldn't tell him this, so I replied    
&gt;Hi Leonard, that's my Linux Activity Reporting Tool. It shows recent security events. Feel free to delete it. Have a great day.",1,1631815790

In my previous job as a sysadmin at a public University I had an interesting event with an email message.   In this job my direct supervisor was a faculty member,  above him was the Department Chairperson.   The Chairperson, we'll call them $bigboss, was not a real nuts and bolts computer person, more of a mathematician.   $bigboss was very smart, but also had a some rather fanciful expectations and I could write a dozen posts easily on crazy stuff I was asked to do.  We had a two person support team and $bigboss probably generated 20% of our projects.

Anyway, I'm in my office one day, working on something, no fires burning, all is well, and $bigboss come hustling in.

$bigboss:  ""I need some help right away""

$bigboss is looking kind of nervous, he's shifting from foot to foot, looking around, acting kind of guilty.

me: ""sure, what I can do for you""

$bigboss:  ""I sent an email and copied someone by mistake, I want you stop the message from getting to that person""

me:  ""if the person is not on our local system its too late, its already gone""

I'm thinking wow, this has some serious ethical implication, I've never dealt with this type of thing.  But this is $bigboss, so I kind of have to do what they want.

$bigboss:  ""no it went to $professor and it shouldn't have""

We used an mbox type system, so I knew the message would be basically a text file, I'm wondering if I can just delete it or edit it?  Will that mess things up?  I'm not really an expert on the MTA we used.  Plus there's the whole ethics question.   Who's message is it now?  Is it $bigboss's or $professors?  Right now its just some bits on our mail server.   But $bigboss is standing over me RIGHT NOW, wringing his hands and looking at me expectantly.

I log into the mailserver and start paging though the logs.  I explain that the logs don't show the message content but when did he send the message, who was it too besides $professor, I need that information to find the entry.  $bigboss give me the info and I find the log entry.  I'm paging a back and forth in the log and then see that $professor had accessed and ""read"" mail AFTER $bigboss's message was delivered.  So now the message is in $professor's mail folder.

me:  ""your message got delivered but $professor has now copied it into their mail folders.   I don't know they have actually read it, but I don't feel comfortable going into their files without their permission""

We had a ""rules of sysadmin conduct"" understanding that we did not look at folks home directories unless the data was obviously public, like web pages, or we had permission, or we were investigating possible misconduct and had sign off from the University legal team and/or data security team.

$bigboss just stood there for a few seconds.  They knew I was doing the correct thing and could not really order me to try and drill down and kill this message.  $bigboss kind of looked into the distance, sighed, thanked me and left.    I don't know what $bigboss ended up doing, probably eating some humble pie with $professor, but I didn't hear any more about it.",1,1631808186

For the most part I actually really like my job except for the handful of troublemaker users that popup time to time. But today I had a problem that came in that was particularly juicy. Now let's call the user Edgar. Edgar is a generally nice person to talk to and a fairly smart person at that. The only problem is Edgar thinks their knowledge professionally extends into fields they don't know much about. For example they will argue with me about how certain things like sending patient info via scanned documents through software is literal facing.  So I get a ticket from Edgar stating that they want their screen to not timeout as quick as it currently does and have the fix applied to all of the PCs in their department.  Well even I could make some snips and changes in the registry to make this happen it would get wiped out by the group policy in place within at least 24 hours and on top of that not only is the amount of time requested that the timeout occur is well beyond those that could be susceptible to creating a security risk, it also can and could potentially violate HIPPA. Now as a little preface to this issue I would like to add I have been asked to do this before for several people and have explain this without issue. Edgar on the other hand is different, because I simply mentioned the fact that it could be done via registry edits they were insistent that it needed to be done. Despite the fact it violates security protocol and violates the HIPAA agreement. I tell Edgar that I am simply not comfortable with performing this fix for this issue as the repercussions for doing this can result in termination for myself. Edgar doesn't care, Edgar wants the timeout to be longer because ""it takes too long to log in and is affecting patient care"". Edgar doesn't work in the OR or the emergency room I have no justification for the support group that sets group policy in place to make this a reality for them. Edgar still insists. I explained to them ""I am not comfortable with doing this and I have been asked to do this before and have declined"". Edgar states that I am not professionally trained to make that assumption. This could be true as I am not a medical professional but I am a certified network technician. I then have to explain why this creates such a massive security risk to Edgar. I spend over an hour explaining this information to them. Edgar still cannot get over the fact that I even remotely mentioned that it is a possibility that it could be done via registry edits but again would be wiped out by group policy within 24 hours if done. So basically there's even no point for me to do this if it could be done. Edgar does not care they want me to increase the timeout for their screen as if it was their last wish. Now like I said earlier I am not a medical professional, I do know that patients can be frustrating to deal with and sometimes there is a sense of urgency when collecting patient information. I am certified network technician and proceed to pull out my network + and security + CompTIA certificates out of my wallet and slide them across the table to show them proof of qualifications. (Sadly I've had to do this a number of times with different users.) I explained to them what the certificates mean and that if they do not feel that I am qualified to perform the task they have asked ""I will gladly reassign the ticket to someone they do feel is qualified"". Edgar immediately back pedals and says that they are sorry ""let's start over"" (at this point the damage had already been done). I'm done talking by now and begin to pack up my equipment into my bag and repeat ""if you do not feel that I am qualified to troubleshoot this issue I will gladly have your ticket reassigned to someone that you feel is."" Edgar than exclaims ""why can't you do increase the timeout."" I then reply with ""because I said so.""

I do not normally treat customers this way but I was at my wit's end with trying to explain to this person why I cannot increase the time out of their computer much less those in the rest of the department. Needless to say and to wrap up the story I submitted a complaint to Edgar's manager stating that if they were to treat me this way and call me ""unprofessional/unqualified"" that I would not be willing to assist them with further IT issues. I don't respect from my customers but I do expect common decency. I don't tell them that they are not qualified for their position and expect the same in return. Sorry for the long post it's been a long day and I needed to vent to something.",1,1631760467

1983,“But how did you get it like that” - a brief adventure in being underhandedly insulted by a client,"There are 2 things you need to know going into this story. The first is that I am a deskside technician for one of the colleges at a large (*very* large) university. I won’t go into detail, but we are badly mismanaged, and things in our department are not great. No one is in a stellar mood lately. Most of the time I feel like I am going to set off the world’s largest computer killing EMP, fight god, and then disappear into the forest and become a witch. The second very important bit of info is that I have neon rainbow colored hair. It is real, I do it myself, and it is my trademark at this point.

Consider this world building information. Henceforth, I shall be known as Very Tired Technician (VTT).

The Mathematics department has a television in their main hallway that functions as a “digital sign,” which in this case means that one of the receptionists, “Katy,” has an extra computer under her desk which is connected to the hallway TV. Said extra computer is connected to an alternate input on one of Katy’s monitors, set to duplicate, and Katy opens a PowerPoint and sets it to run infinitely on said TV. This TV’s stopped working, so I pick up the ticket and go to poke at the complicated setup. I have to temporarily move Katy from her desk to do so, and she hovers next to me as I work. 

Katy: So, how did you get your hair like that? Did you…spray it, or something?
VTT, trying my best to be cheerful: No, it’s Manic Panic. It’s just hair dye.
Katy, in the most insulting possible tone: But how did you get it like that? Wh…do you *want* it to look like that? Is that for *Halloween* or something?

*am I hearing this correctly?*

VTT, utterly horrified: …no. It’s been this way for more than a year. I keep it like this.

At this moment, another employee walks up and motions to Katy’s computer, and speaks to me.

Other Employee: Oh Hi, Curious! While you’re looking at Katy’s computer, we had a zoom meeting this morning and no one could hear Katy.
Katy: Oh yeah, there was a zoom this morning and no one could hear me, but I could hear them. And then they could hear me but I couldn’t hear them. My computer audio isn’t connected.
*Ah. Clear as mud.*
VTT: So…could you hear them?
Katy: I could hear them but they couldn’t hear me.
I take a cursory look at the setup around me.
VTT, motioning to the desk: There isn’t a microphone connected to this computer. 
Katy: They couldn’t hear me!
*I am beginning to crack.*
VTT: Yeah, there doesn’t seem to be a microphone connected to this computer.
Katy: They couldn’t see me either.
VTT: There also isn’t a camera. Cameras and microphones often come together. You’ll need a camera and microphone if you want to be seen and heard.

At this moment, Other Employee appears from the ether, with a webcam for Katy. I attempt to regain my normal, cheerful demeanor, and motion to the camera.
VTT: See, that’ll solve it!
Katy: I turned the speakers all the way up and they still couldn’t hear me!
*What.*
VTT: Yeah, you have to have some kind of microphone for the other people to hear you.
Katy: So then what are the speakers for?

Much, much later in the interaction, a student employee notices me, and asks a question.
Student: Do you have to bleach your hair to get that color to take?
I begin to answer yes, but Katy answers instead, in a tone clearly intended to ridicule the offense that I honestly thought I had done a good job disguising: “Oh, don’t ask her about her hair!”

*Maybe I’ll look up those books on witchcraft after all.*",1,1631672625

1985,Dressing appropriately.,"There was a post in a different subreddit where the first part of this was posted as a response.   I decided I needed to finish the story, and this is the best place for it.  


Many years ago, I was in tech support for major software vendor.  We had a cluster of products that all worked together with our backbone product.    


On day, I received  a call from Sales folks, they have a customer who wants a meeting with someone who knows XYZ product.   I'm the TS expert for this particular product, so of course they called me.   Check schedules and with my manager, yeah I can do it on day/date.  


This is the first time I've ever even met a customer, so in the morning I dithering about how to dress.  Full suit?   Just a button down?  Tie?   Finally I give up, jeans and corp polo shirt.  


In the meeting room waiting on customer is my boss, the Director of TS, Sales folks, their manager and the Director of Sales.   I'm feeling seriously underdressed, as even my boss is in a button down &amp; tie.  


A few minutes later, another Sales person shows in the customer team.   Their guy in a suit, ignores everyone else, comes straight to me.   ""You must be Otter, I'm {name} Director &amp; Sponsor of the project at our company.""  He then introduces the other 2 folks, one of who is the Tech Lead for the project.  


I guess I dress appropriately so that the customer was able to pick the techie out of a room full of people.  


They explain their project and how they see our product fitting in.   They start peppering me with questions, I'm asking them questions, the white board fills with notes and diagrams.  Sales folks offer to get us drinks, our Directors say they'll get the drinks.   I found out later, the Director of Sales, didn't want his Sales guys to miss anything.  


Thing is, after 30 minutes, the Sales folks' eyes have glazed over.   Tech Lead and I are way deep in how the product works {I asked boss &amp; Directory, ok to go this deep?   
 Yes}. completely redesigning the project.   We paused, looked at our Directors.  ""Umm, are you ok with what we're doing?""   Both nod.   So we keep going.  


Another hour later, their project is now centered around our product, not just using it and the design hooks are there to use other products from us.  


A few weeks later I received a $1000 bonus from the sale team.  
6 months later I was promoted, with this meeting cited as one of the reason for the promotion.  
I ended doing many technical meetings with customers and even ended up on the Trade Show circuit.",1,1631652786
1986,Never keep the keys inside the safe,"This is a self-tech-support. Just happened to me, but thought I should share as a cautionary tale to others.

I run a small VPS hosting among other things, a Nextcloud and a Bitwarden instance. I can then sync and access them on any of my devices. The whole thing is then backed up nightly to a completely different host. Frequent testing of backups always (mostly) go smooth. I thought I was pretty safe from disaster.

The Nextcloud instance often goes down - it's running in a pretty flaky Docker container. Often a quick reboot of the server is the easiest way to bring it back up, especially when logging in on my phone. Today such a thing happened. I saw some errors from Nextcloud, SSH'd into the VPS and gave it a reboot. Then carried on with my day.

I came to look into it a little more later in the evening. Only to discover that the whole server seemed to be unresponsive now. Might be a bigger issue than I originally thought...

Then I go to SSH into the server and I notice I have been logged out of my Bitwarden account, so I can't access the nice, long, complex and secure password. The same on my phone. I can access the web page, but it won't let me log in for some reason. Thoughts of ""have I been hacked somehow?"" start floating by. I am now completely locked of all my accounts.

I figure the only way out of this is to rebuild everything from the backups. This is when I realise I can't even access the backups as the passwords for them are also in Bitwarden. There is literally nothing I can do.

After some frantic clicking about and considering what important information might be in the vault, I begin considering how feasible it would be to crack the encryption, before resigning myself to just start from scratch. Then I remember I have an old laptop with Bitwarden on it.

I boot it up and immediately disable the WiFi, I don't want it trying to connect to the broken server. I then open up Bitwarden and it still has the passwords in the cache - it lets me unlock the vault and I'm in! I quickly export the vault before anything can happen.

I finally have access to all the passwords and can SSH into the server again. The issue seems to be that the disk is completely full. I delete some files and everything starts working again.

I thought I was safe from losing everything. But that's only if I can actually access my passwords. I have now stored some of my most important passwords outside of the biggest point of failure.",1,1631651983

1988,Create a ticket? I WOULD IF YOU'D LET ME,"I'm a web developer and I very... not friendly relationship with the in-house IT team for one of my clients. They have a ticketing system, which I totally get. We use tickets too, and I often have to ask my clients to open tickets when they email me directly. However, I don't have access to their ticketing system. I won't be granted access to their ticketing system. So they want me to relay ticket requests through my client contact, rather than just resolve things via email (or open the tickets themselves, whatever they need to do). Which I might be more patient about if they didn't seem to feel the need to make it clear that they think I'm an idiot in every email they send me.

Here's today's interaction which really pissed me off. Note that all of these emails had my client contact CC'd.

Me (cc Client): Hi IT, the new key (xxxx) you gave me isn't working on our subdomain. Can you please add the subdomain to the allowed list of domains for that key?

IT (cc Client): The key for subdomain is yyyy, not xxxx. Here is the list of domain allowed for that key. Please open a new request for changes if needed at &lt;link&gt;.

Me (cc Client): Oh, my bad. Can you please send me the full key (since we're communicating via last-4-digits)?

Other IT Guy (cc Client): No. We don't share complete keys by email obviously. Also, it looks like you've mixed up keys, make sure to use keys properly, they are domain specific.

Me (cc Client): \*deep breath\* I'm aware of that.  I was expecting that perhaps you could send it to me via onetimesecret or some other method  &lt;!-- you know, the same way you sent the other key to us when you shared it OBVIOUSLY --&gt; But nevermind anyway because I found it in our documentation.

Me (cc Client): I'm unable to open tickets at the link provided. Can you please add \[my local domain\] to the key ending in yyyy?

IT (cc Client): Have (@)Client open a ticket once you have all the required change requests ready.

Me (cc Client):  (@)Client, can you please open a ticket to add \[my local domain\] to the key ending in yyyy?",1,1631641807
1989,Objects in the Rear View Mirror,"The past is never history. It will haunt you till your dying breath and follow you like an annoying fan. Now that you are all suitably depressed let’s get on with how the past followed me to my new job. I was working for a web hosting company as phone support and was doing quite well. The start of a weekend shift had come which begins on a Friday and ends on a Monday. These shifts are great as we normally don’t take many calls so get time to study/read/watch and catchup on things.

Then something completely unexpected happens in the call centre… the phone rings. I pick up and do my spiel mentioning the web hosting company I work for and asking how I can help.

Caller: “Yeah I would like to take you up on your wine offer.” A lot of perplexed blinking ensured.

Me: “I’m sorry?”

Caller: “The one in your latest issue. It sounds like a good deal; can you tell me anything about the wines included?”

My brain has reached a terminal fault. Where am I? What year is it? What is going on? 

Caller: “This is $winecompany isn’t it?”

Did he just mention the name of the company I use to work for? At this point my brain is trying to flip its script from the new job record over to the past job record and it is scratching like a DJ during the Eurovision Song Contest.

Me: “Err no. This is $webhosting company. I think you got the wrong number.” At this point I notice ringing in the background. A lot more than normal. People are picking up calls left and right all while this scratching record in my brain is playing “aweem away” from the Lion Sleeps Tonight on repeat.

Caller: “This is the number in the magazine $number.”

Me: “Yeah that’s our number but we are a web hosting company. We aren’t $winecompany. I can’t help you.”

The call ends only to be followed quickly by another…. And another.. and they don’t stop coming, and they don’t stop coming, and they don’t stop coming. All are the same, nice elderly people wanting to purchase wine from us.. just like when I worked for $winecompany.

Turns out that what was going to be a wonderful relaxing weekend shift turned into a nightmare of constant wine calls from my past. The $winecompany in question put our number in their latest magazine instead of theirs. This wasn’t just a simple digit off we are talking about but 3 whole last digits are completely different. We had to get more people in to cover the amount of phone calls coming in and it cost the company a huge amount of money to deal with it. We were all dead by the end of the weekend. My nice tipple of wine at the end of a long shift became a grim reminder of what I had just worked through.

Well the two companies finally sat down with each other and made some sort of arrangement in regard to the problems we faced. Probably a large amount of money changing hands. What did we get in the call centre? A bottle of wine for free from $winecompany.",1,1631623561

Two workers called my uncle saying that there is something with their hard drive.My uncle ran norton disk doctor and in progress the warning poped up.

When he came back he saw his colleague doing something with the computer. He asked what did he do and he said ""i ran norton disk doctor"".My uncle asked didn't it give some warnings? and the colleague answered yes but i don't know english so i just ignored all those warnings.

the workers didn't copy the data but there was the same files on another computer and the colleague didn't get fired so i guess its happy end",1,1631599613

The cast:

Jordan - FNG

Thomas - Me, the manager and network admin

John - The older of my two other reports, primarily responsible for server maintenance, major application upgrades, and supporting our smaller off-site locations and their specific applications

Daniel - The younger of my two original employees, though here for the same amount of time as John. Both longer than me, actually. Desktop and server support, document management and phone system support, phenomenal people skills.

**DAY 79** - What is your job?

It's early in the morning.  I sit in my office working on managery things.  Jordan's desk is right outside my office door, which is open as usual.  The IT workgroup rings and Jordan picks up.  There are few tickets open right now for once, and I know that Jordan is not currently working on anything.  I listen with half an ear to the exchange, catching snippets like ""Internet Explorer not working"".  We do have a couple legacy systems that only work in IE.  After a few moments Jordan hangs up, and a minute later a ticket opens in our system.  [User] is having trouble with Internet Explorer.

I wait.  John and Daniel are otherwise occupied.  Along with other stories posted here, I have had several chats with Jordan about his work ethic.  He often must be reminded to answer phones and work on tickets.  He will take any excuse to shirk responsibility and sit all day, doing nothing of value.  Shocking, I know.

""Jordan, are you going to look at that ticket you put in?""

""I don’t know what’s wrong with it.  She said Internet Explorer was there, but it’s not there.  Or like it was incompatible or something.""

""What?""

""I don’t know.  She was really bad at explaining.""

""And?""

""I don't know what the problem is.""

Breathe.  Calm.  Zen.  Let the stupidity wash over you, Thomas.  Don't let it soak in.  Don't let it affect you.  You are a stone in the river, and the water must break around y-

*eye twitch*

""GO FIGURE IT OUT.""

There.  That feels better.  *twitch*

A couple hours later I call Jordan into my office for another of our chats.  

""Close the door behind you.  Have a seat.""

""What's up?""

""What is your job?""

""Helpdesk Technician.""

""And what does that entail?""

""Installing computers, installing Office...""

""What skills are required for your job?""

""Technical knowledge, common sense?""

""Problem-solving.  Yes?""

""Yeah.""

""What did you say to me earlier when I asked you if you were going ot look at that ticket?""

""I said I didn't know how to fix the problem.""

""Close, but not quite.  And the distinction here is important.  You said 'I don't know what the problem is.'  The users' job, as far as interfacing with IT and putting in tickets, is to explain their problem as best they can.  Our job is to figure out and fix the problem.  What should have been the first step of your troubleshooting process?""

""Make sure the network cable is plugged in and reboot?""

""Have them show you the problem.""

At this point I decided to launch into a problem-solving exercise I've done with people before.  I pulled this from a previous issue that I had to deal with for a user.  I gave him the description of the problem I was given back when the issue actually occurred.  

""Let's do an exercise.  I'm going to give you a problem, you tell me what you'd try and I'll give you whatever information is relevant.  You're with the user at their computer.  Got it?

""Sure.""

""The internet is broken.""

""What do you mean?""

""I mean I tried to go to a webpage and it said 'page cannot be displayed.'""

""It sounds like you have a bad network cable.  Replace it?""

""Why would you do that?""

""Didn’t you say before to do the simplest thing?""

""Yes, but what makes you think replacing the cable is the simplest answer to the problem?""

""I don’t know…""

""OK.  You replaced the network cable and it didn’t fix the problem.""

""Check the network port to see if it’s active?""

""It is.""

""I don’t know what to do.""

""What have you not done?""

""I don’t know.  Check if the wireless is connected?""

""It’s not wireless.""

""I don’t know what to do.""

""What have you not done yet?""

""I don’t know.""

""You haven't asked me to show you the problem.  We just went over this.  This example comes from a ticket I was given a few years ago where I presumed the person who put in the ticket did all the basic troubleshooting and it turned out they hadn't.  I drove 45 minutes to get to the client, sat down, and said 'show me the problem.'  The next thing I know she's typing the address to her friend's cat blog (no joke here) wrong, with a D in blogspot instead of a G.  That was the whole issue.  The users explain the problem to us as best they can.  Most of them are not particularly computer-savvy and what they tell you will not necessarily correlate to reality.  It is your job to bridge that gap.  You have to figure out what they want and what is stopping them from getting it.""

""OK.  I'll try to be better about that.""

""Alright.  Good.  One last thing.  Yesterday you were sitting at the bench working on something and you belched really loudly.  You remember that?""

""Yeah.  I think it happens because I drink my water too fast.""

""OK, well, I can't help you with that problem.  But you don't have to be so loud, and you definitely don't have to follow it up by explaining to us how the belch felt.  It's gross.""

""OK, I'll work on that.""

""Thank you.""

2001,Why do this on a school computer,"  

Background: During my junior year I use to work for my school's IT department. Got to meet a lot of cool people and loved my bosses. I feel bad for quitting during covid though.

I was in charge of re-imaging iMacs on a lower floor. It was a part of a task that needed to be completed every so month to keep the computer running fast. This iMac was located in a small room where no one can get in without reserving it. You need to either have someone unlock it for you or keys. There were no windows, it was just that iMac and a desk along with some basic university furniture i.e., a couch and some stiff chairs.

I start the basic process for re-imaging the computer. For Macs you first have to take it off Deepfreeze. Deepfreeze is just a software that my school uses to make sure a user's information is not remembered upon a computer restarting. So, nothing is saved. When a student decides to log onto a public computer, the first page that comes up is the school sign in page. This gives a student access to the Wi-Fi. Once there they need to enter their school’s username and password. When they are done using the computer, they just need to restart, and their information is no longer attached to the computer they were at. 

Once the iMac is off deepfreeze, we run the basic mac updates. There was either an issue with the iMac or software itself. I told my supervisor and they just told me to lock up and wait until further notice. 

So, I locked the room and went onto my other task. Next day rolls around and my supervisor tells me to go look at the computer. I went to go look at the computer and brought along a co-worker who knows almost everything about Apple products. We go downstairs and log onto the computer.

To reiterate - this computer was left over night without deepfreeze on it. And in this case, it will save the history of whoever uses it. 

We go to the basic iMac web browser, Safari. Once there we were prompted to enter a username and password to the school's sign in page. The username field is usually blank, but in this case, it auto filled to a user. Something told me to check the browsing history. There was a lot of  dirty links like a bunch of topics that will make you question why someone would look this up .

My first reaction was to take a picture. Really unsure why. The tech guy I brought with me also got a very hefty laugh out of it. He then cleared the history and we reported it to our boss. In the reports I did note I remember the user having the last name xyz. Over and done with, right? 

Well not entirely - because there were only two people who had access that night. One was a student leader another was a janitor. 

We never found out who did it, and the computer was re-imaged promptly, and sanitized.",1,1631415132

Salesperson – No description needed.


Me answering the phone – ""Hello. This is Me""

Manager – ""Hey Me we're not getting any email and I can't send any either. I can surf the Internet just no email. Oh and I think WiFi is down also.""

Me – ""Will that's not right. Any power issues?""

This is an industrial area of the city and the power company liked to perform work on the weekends while it wasn't as busy.

Manager – ""No power has been good so far. We need to get the email going again. I'm waiting for some important messages from New Car Manufacturer that I need yesterday. If we can't send any emails to clients we could lose sales. It's really important we get this fixed ASAP..."" Continue more droning on about the importance of his email.

Stopping him mid-sentence.

Me – ""Okay no problem. Wife and I were already heading to nearby shopping destination, so I'll be there in about 10 minutes.""

Upon my arrival I head directly to the server room and find UPS's complaining about being on battery and the email server powered down. Okay, we do have a power issue. Checking the rest of the room I find the primary Dealer Management System, DHCP Server, Parts Catalog, Routers and Switches are all up and running. WiFi controllers and of course the Email Server are down. I'm checking power feeds when Manager pokes his head in and continues to tell me how important email is with several sales people in the behind him complaining about no WiFi.

Me - ""I know. Trying to find out why portions of my racks don't have power. So no power glitches happened after you guys opened? Email was working when you got here?""

Manager – ""Yea, no lights flickered and was able to access email right away. Then the sales people started complaining about WiFi.""

At this point I'm now headed to the hallway where the electrical panels were located. All five of them. With some of the worst labeling I've ever seen. Decades of labels, marker, crayon of locations that were mostly unreadable. Random Salesperson walks up.

Salesperson – ""Hey Me, are you looking for the breaker for the lunchroom?""

Me – ""No, some power is out on the server racks and I'm trying to figure out why.""

Salesperson – ""Well if you find the one for the lunchroom let me know. The toaster isn't working""

Me – ""Well okay but not my priority at the moment.""

You see this building used to be a Big Box Hardware store before they got bigger. During the dealership renovation apparently the electricians did not trace or update the labeling of the electrical circuits in the whole building. Old or new. During the renovation of the building I did remember seeing the old plans and that the server room and neighboring storage rooms used to be the manager offices for Big Box Hardware. In the forth panel I finally find an old label for ""manager office"" and find the tripped breaker. I reset the breaker and turn it back on and seconds later it trips again. In the mean time I hear from down the hall...

Salesman – ""Hey you found it! Nope, it's off again!""

What. The. Hell. 

I go into the lunch room and find him at the toaster with a bagel inside and next to it a crock pot full of warm chili. Staff lunch has killed portions of the network. As I came to realization that several of the lunch room receptacles were on the same circuit as parts of the server room some 50 feet away, my level of cursing began to rise. With Salesman's help we moved the crock pot and toaster to the other side of the room which was still working. I reset the breaker and began to curse the original electricians as I brought the systems back up in the server room. I then retrieve my trusty label maker and label the breaker and receptacles. Adding warnings to each location just in case. I updated management working that day that their lunch brought down their email and my wife and I continued our shopping spree. Me being pretty irritated at the comedy of errors.

The following Monday I contact General Manager and explain what happened. I also let him know that I was making an executive decision and that I contacted their electrician and had him add multiple 30 amp circuits to the server room. Always the professionals, they also traced the remaining receptacles in the room and labeled them. To prevent further interruption I set aside a late evening trip onsite to move the UPS's over to the new circuits and all was right with the world again. 

Hope that chili was worth it.",1,1631375582
2004,"Hey, I can't get to the server...","This is a short one.  Years ago, I was in charge of IT for a medium sized (\~50k people) municipality.  One day, we start getting reports from Village Hall that people can't get to the main file server.  My office is in our lovely trailer next door, so I walk over to have a look at one of the problem computers.  Sure enough...she can't get there.  I jump into a command prompt and do some checks and what the heck...where did this IP come from?  The computer had an address from a DHCP server that wasn't ours.  After a bit of ""sh ip arp"" and ""sh mac address-table"", I found the offending port and disconnected it.  Unfortunately, we never had great documentation of where all of the ports were, so we had to do some hunting.  In relatively short order, I found the culprit.  Being a public building, the Village Hall was used for early voting.  With no notice to us, the county sent people in to setup the conference room used for this purpose.   Whoever they sent to do the setup plugged in a regular Linksys router to the network jack in the room.   I unplugged it, resisted the urge to make it permanently inoperable, and put it in a box with a note to \*not\* plug it in again.",1,1631372185

I have been doing this too long.  
I had started in Support at $\_access\_control\_vendor a year before. I had become a Senior support person after several of my cohort had departed. As Y2k approached, our manager set up this plan for New Years.  
The entire team would be at the office with the seniors arriving at 3pm to handle flow from global customers, and the juniors arriving at 8pm. So 12 of us got our stuff squared away, Some of the guys had brought sleeping bags.

We were getting no calls. We had done a three year effort to weed out the bug, but we were sure not everyone had done their software and firmware upgrade.

The phone rang. A staffer at a Friendly European defense ministry was doing a check-in to find out if any of their critical defense or infrastructure sites had had issues, and to request notification if they did. ""No calls"" we said.  
Management brought in a ton of food at 8pm, and the phone rang every ten minutes or so with another integrator or command center asking if any problems had been reported.  
After dinner one of the guys announced he had brought Unreal tournement, and our most senior tech opened some ports... soon we were all in our cubes eagerly trying to kill each other while we waited for the sky to fall at Midnight.

As soon as New years came on the East Coast we had shut the game down, and had our plan together for call taking rotation ect. We were all sure that the phone would be off the hook by 12:30 or so.

The check-in calls kept coming in.  
Then we got an actual call. The user hadn't upgraded. The old version had a known bug. They would schedule an immediate upgrade.  
And that was it. As we approached New years at each time zone, people would call in asking for status, and then the calls would stop.  
We played video games for another eight hours or so (getting paid holiday pay, plus double time and a half for every hour over 8.) They sent the juniors home first. Then the seniors who wanted to go.

2006,construction site tech support,"Firstly, nobody has my permission to repost this story off Reddit. Secondly, all names are blatant pseudonyms. Thirdly, this was a while ago so details have been lost in the mists of time and my food allergy.

&amp;#x200B;

Time for a wibbly wobbly timey wimey flashback to the early aughts. I was working first level helpdesk for Big Blue Construction Company in Edinburgh. We had construction sites all over Scotland, from one or two guys with picks and shovels to replacing multi-mile lengths of motorway cutting through the Central Belt.  

&amp;#x200B;

The internets were a big thing then, with clients demanding regular and frequent reports via email. The problem with this was that, for the guys in remote rural Scotland and/or on the Western or Northern Isles, internet access could well be GPRS on their Nokia mobile phone.

&amp;#x200B;

This site... wasn't one of them. It was a huge, prestige site. It was so important, and so long lasting, that they managed to source ADSL from Brutish Telecon, at a stunning 512/256 mb. The construction guys loved being able to hit send on an email and - it sent! Poof! Gone!

&amp;#x200B;

The site secretary, the glue that held the whole thing together with her comprehensive knowledge of the company and the client, was Jane. Jane was a sincerely lovely person. I loved working with her because she would do \*what I asked her to do\* without trying to interpret what I was saying. When Jane called I'd usually drop everyone else because she was so super nice, and on the odd occasion I managed to visit her on site she'd have a lovely cuppa tea and a plate of biscuits ready. (This wasn't just for me - she did this to all the tech guys, or the client reps, or the random lost dude, she was just hard wired that way. As I said - super nice lady! And somewhat of a unicorn...)

&amp;#x200B;

So, Jane calls in a panic, late on a Thursday. The deadline for this report was tomorrow morning, 9am,  and this report was the one that'd get Big Blue Construction Company paid the first tranche of money for the project, a high 6 figure / low 7 figure chunk of cash at \*this\* stage. So it was a ""drop everything"" priority. Needless to say, Jane was up to high do about it.

&amp;#x200B;

First things first. Calm Jane down, because I was having difficulty making out what she was saying. Bats could hear her fine, mind.  Calm her down, get her to tell me what's going on. Jane had compiled the reports from everyone else. Site engineers, construction supervisors, architects, etc etc, along with lovely photos showing progress, into one nice big PowerPoint.  

&amp;#x200B;

Tech time. BBCC used NT4 desktop / laptop, NetWare and Windows servers (this was a transition time when the NetWare servers were being slowly replaced by Windows servers in BBCC), and GroupWise as the email client. GroupWise did a nice thing - if you emailed an attachment to loads of people, it would upload just the one copy of the attachment, then send a link to the stored version to the recipients, so that you didn't end up with loads of copies of the same thing cluttering up your email server.

&amp;#x200B;

There is one caveat to that, though. It would do the one copy thing for everyone on your server. For those outside your company? Individual copies. To several dozen client rep type people. Of a 100-plus megabyte PowerPoint presentation. Over a 512/256mb ADSL connection. That everyone else on site was also using for equally business critical \*cough\* streaming radio \*cough\* purposes.

&amp;#x200B;

Yeah. I explained to Jane this wasn’t going to work. Well, it would – just it’d take probably the weekend to upload the copies to our server which would then blitz it out, several days late and causing financial penalties.

&amp;#x200B;

“But what can I DOOOO?!?!?” she wailed.

&amp;#x200B;

And that was when Jane learned couriers were still available. And she had a CD burner. And yes, I’d get one of our guys to drop off a bunch of blank CDs as she was worried she wouldn’t have enough. Yes, he got a nice cuppa tea and some biscuits...

&amp;#x200B;

The cast:

Jordan - FNG
Thomas - Me, the manager and network admin
John - The older of my two other reports, primarily responsible for server maintenance, major application upgrades, and supporting our smaller off-site locations and their specific applications
Daniel - The younger of my two original employees, though here for the same amount of time as John. Both longer than me, actually. Desktop and server support, document management and phone system support, phenomenal people skills.
Laurie - My director.  Also the director of the business department.

**DAY 63** - Listen and Obey

Something that has been a problem with Jordan from the start is trust.  Less than two weeks in and he [lied about a password written on a sticky note and threw his coworker Daniel under the bus](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/pemwdf/the_new_guy_chronicles_episode_2_the_betrayal/) in the process.  Only a couple weeks later, in a story I can't post because of sub rules about phishing stories, he again lied about something I already knew the whole truth about.  I had to drag the truth out of him while explaining that trust is important.  He also commented one day during a conversation amongst all of us in IT ""You guys know how hard it is to pull one over on my mom.""

On this day his lie cost us only time, but revealed to me the true desperation of the situation I was in and how little help I would have from above.  

Jordan was sent to install a very old, very finnicky program for a user.  There are specific instructions for installing this program that must be followed to the letter, and they are detailed in a document entitled [Program] Installation Instructions.docx in the program's directory on our public IT drive.  The document includes detailed instructions, screenshots, and links to various files.  Before sending Jordan on the installation, John showed him the location of the guide, went through the guide with him, and explicitly instructed him to follow the guide's exact procedures when installing.  I heard all this transpire.

Cue SpongeBob ""A few minutes later...""  Jordan calls and John picks up.

""So, [program] isn't running correctly.  It opens, but when they try to do anything it gives [error].""

""And you followed the instructions in the guide when installing it?  You clicked the link to the installer?""

""Yeah.""

""OK.  Let's try a few things.""

What followed was several minutes of troubleshooting what can actually be an incredibly tricky program.  It's old, unsupported, and uncooperative.  After around 10-15 minutes of troubleshooting, John asks again.

""So when you installed this you clicked the link in the guide for the installer, right?""

""Well... No.  I went into the folder and picked the installer that I thought looked right.""

""Jordan...  Alright.  Uninstall it, reboot, and install it again.  *Follow the instructions this time* and let me know if it doesn't work.""  *click*

John looked at me with frustration and anger in his eyes, and I promised him I'd do my best to have something done about the situation.

**DAY 70**

*in Laurie's office*

Laurie: ""Jordan, we brought you in here to talk about a miscommunication with John the other day.""

Me: ""You went through the process of installing with John and Daniel beforehand, right?""

Jordan: ""Yes.""

Me: ""And they explained the process and the installation guide?""

Jordan: ""Yes.""

Me: ""When you called down for help what was the first thing John asked you?""

Jordan: ""I don't remember.""

Me: ""He asked you if you'd followed the instructions and clicked the link in the installation guide.""

Jordan: *shocked Pikachu face* ""He did?  I don't remember that.""

I sat there thinking we had him this time.  It was not to be.

Laurie: ""Is it possible that you weren't paying attention and you weren't listening to what John said?""

Jordan: ""Maybe.  I must not have been.""

Laurie: ""Do you think you can work on doing better at that in the future?""

Jordan: ""Yes.  I'll try to do better about paying attention.""

I knew that he was lying, and I knew that he was just taking the out that Laurie had given him to save face.  

Me: ""Jordan, do you understand how difficult it is for people to work with you when they can't trust that what you say is the truth?""

Jordan: ""I do.""

Me: *staring him in the eyes* ""Whether it's because you aren't paying attention to what's going on or because you're lying to cover for yourself, if I and your coworkers can't trust that what you're saying is true and accurate, it's extremely difficult to work with you.""

Jordan was excused a minute later and I spoke directly with Laurie.

""You know he was lying, right?""

""I don't know.  Maybe he just really wasn't paying attention.""

""He was lying to save his own skin and keep himself from looking bad.  It's what he always does.  He did the same thing when he threw Daniel under the bus for the password issue and when he lied to me about the phishing email.  This is the third time, Laurie.  How are we supposed to work with him?""

""We'll see.  Maybe he'll get better.""

""You know as well as I do that if anyone else acted like he is they'd have been gone weeks ago.""

""You're probably right.  But it's tricky.""

""Look.  I'm relying on you, Laurie.  Obviously no one cares what I think because they didn't let me actually write him up for lying last time.  You're my director and I'm bringing this to your attention.  I can't do anything.""

""I'll see what we can do.  Just keep notes on everything he does in case we need it.""

""Alright.  I'll keep notes.  Just know that John and Daniel have both told me multiple times they can't keep this up.""

2013,The easiest overtime ever,"Hello! No, this isn't the story mentioned in my last post, I'm still figuring out how to tell that one, but this story crossed my mind and I thought it would be interesting to tell.

Players:

Me: I'm here!


This took place, oh, about four years ago now. Our IT infrastructure company had been contracted to install the data, access control, and camera systems for a new tortilla factory. There was actually very little data and access control, mostly limited to WAPs and the administration areas. There were, however, over 100 cameras, with complete coverage of the production and packaging areas. Because they wanted HD quality recording practically 24/7, they needed a seven-figure camera server to handle the video.

All of that was not particularly difficult, and it was even quite fun to learn how to configure the cameras and add them to the system. The issue came after they had their electrical inspection.

They failed so hard that the owners fired the electrician for gross incompetence. (For reference on how bad it was, one of the feeder lines for a breaker panel was attached to the wall by screwing through the conduit.) They then hired a new electrician who called all hands on deck to make it right.

So how do I fit in to all of this? How do I get the easiest overtime ever?

One Saturday, they needed to completely shut off power to the half of the building that contained the main communication room. This meant their fancy camera server would go offline. As we weren't done configuring the system, we hadn't turned over the passwords, so we had to go handle it in person.

My boss explained this to me Friday afternoon. He then gave me the following instructions:

1. Ask the electricians for a corded plug to feed the UPS from a powered part of the building.

2. If that failed, log in and perform a graceful shutdown to protect the system from possible corruptions due to the UPS shutting down.

If you are like how I was at the time, you might be thinking ""why do we need to shut it down if there's a UPS?"" Turns out that the UPS only lasts for about 30 minutes, it's only ever meant to be a bridge until the onsite backup generators kick in.

I arrive onsite and my first order of business is to find an electrician. Done, they're everywhere. Then the conversation goes a little something like this:

Me: ""hey, do you guys have a corded plug?""

Electrician: ""the hell is a corded plug?""

We go back and forth, asking other electricians, calling my boss for clarification (he only ever repeats the term 'corded plug' like that's perfectly clear) for about an hour. As we're coming up on t-zero for power-off, the electrician finally says:

""Wait, does he mean 'extension cord?' Because yes, we have some of those, but none long enough for what you need.""

*Primes.exe has stopped responding*

I rush in to the comm room and log in, shutting the server down just as they hit the disconnect and the lights go dark. I then call my boss to ask if I need to do anything else.

""Nope, the system will start automatically when they turn the server back on. Come on home, you still have a lawn to mow.""

Did I mention my boss is also my dad?

So that's the story of getting paid an hour of overtime for shutting down a server.

PS: I can't think of a tl;dr for this story, so the most upvoted one in the comments after 24 hours is going in.

I tell him the password again and he then says: ""Yes I have been trying that"". We go through the password letter by letter and after I am certain he has the right one I connect remotely to his machine.

2015,I pressed the other button,"So, obligatory warning: first time poster, on mobile.


Now I don’t officially work tech support. I like to say that I am Tier 0 IT-I handle the things that don’t need to get escalated to the help desk.


Had a fun little 2-parter today. To make sense of this, my coworkers use mobile workstations, which have an internal battery pack, and all the workstations log into a virtual desktop when you tap your ID or enter your username/password. This virtual desktop is *supposed* to start automatically when you log in…


So, coworker calls me over: “Can you look at the computer in X room? It’s black and isn’t doing anything. I tried unplugging everything and pushing the buttons (on the monitor-the actual computer is locked inside the workstation to guard against overzealous users), and it’s not doing anything.”
Me: “Is it making noise?” (The last time I got an issue like this, the computer was fine, but the monitor was unplugged, so I’m assuming that’s the problem here.)
Coworker: “No.”


So into the room I go, and the computer isn’t doing anything at all. Check the indicator lights on the workstation. Battery fully charged. Alarms muted. Power…power? Press power button on workstation. Computer starts turning on.
Coworker: “What did you do?”
“I pressed the other button.” (I wasn’t a total jerk. I did proceed to show coworker where that power button was so next time I don’t have to be called in to fix this.)


5 minutes later: “Can I bother you again? That computer still isn’t working right. The icons aren’t showing up.”


Now this is a fairly simple one, so I just talked the coworker through manually initiating the virtual machine and hey presto! It works!


This really isn’t the coworker’s fault-these are both common issues that I have to deal with almost weekly. This just happens to be the first time in a while they occurred together.",1,1631238473

“You know how it asks if you want to save it before you close? I did that.”

I couldn’t speak. To save an excel document, she hit the x to close it. Somehow (shockingly enough) she closed it without saving. Report is gone, wiped from existence.

I inform her she’s going to have to do it again. I teach her how to save a document, and then watch as she tries to save it as a folder instead of a file. I went ahead and saved the blank document for her on her desktop so she can easily find it tomorrow.

2019,Find out who made these phone sex calls or you're paying for it!,"This is from a few years back but I was reminded of it by a commenter in another one of my threads. I work in the telephone field and we had a complaint that a hotel had racked up significant charges to a phone sex line over a number of days. It was my task to determine how this might have happened.

Title aside, as there really wasn't anyway for the hotel to recoup the costs from my company, I was curious enough to really want to know how myself. It was SOP to restrict common toll dialing patterns on all systems. I first checked the most likely source and confirmed that rooms could not dial the number in question. I checked payphones, modems, fax machines and none could dial the number. Ultimately, I found that the Console and the Managers phone were unrestricted and the only devices that could dial the number. 

To say that the owner was not happy with this discovery was an understatement. He assured me that none of his staff would have done this and that one particular call was nearly 12 hours long. How could anyone be on the phone that long and still perform their duties. In answer to his question, I asked if anyone worked alone and if he(the Owner) could compare the time the calls that were made against the duty schedule. Low and behold, one name came up over and over. This conversation was happening in the Managers office where two other female staff were within earshot. Both women were rubbing their arms as if to wipe away something dirty. Disgust doesn't quite cover it. My job done, I made an exit and I've always wondered how that conversation went with the culprit. I've also always wondered what he was doing for 12 hours, I'm sort of impressed.",1,1631219470
2020,Two quickies from my days in retail,"I used to work for an early chain of computer stores, back when everything was new and cheap and cheaply new.

Two similar stories from people who wanted in on the computer craze, I'll let you try to figure out the punchline for each of the two stories.

As a hint, because things were done so differently back then, computer peripherals often did not come in a box, but were packed in a clear plastic bag, stapled shut with a piece of cardboard at the top that had a hole so the bag could be hung on a display rack.

Complaint number one:

""I just bought this new computer, but this mouse is way too hard to use through the dust cover. Is there anything I can do? The plastic wrinkles and it doesn't move across the desk very well.

Complaint number two:

I love the computer, but the foot pedal is hard to use. Do you have anything that is easier?

Eh, what the heck. A bonus third one:

I had really important files on a disk (5 1/2""), but when I cut it to fit into the new drive (3.5"" I can't get anything to load. Can I get this fixed today?",1,1631204168
2021,My Mouse Is Sideways,"Still one of the favourite tickets I've ever seen and had to share.  
Ticket Title: My mouse is sideways  
Ticket Description: My mouse is sideways  


The IT techs in the room are trying to decipher what this user could be referring to. She's been with the company about 4 weeks, taking over from another staff member so no one really knew her very well yet.  
We had a myriad of guesses originally ranging from, 'Perhaps she's flipped her screen so the mouse is moving side to side when she wants it to be moving up and down'. 'Perhaps she's just an idiot and expects IT to literally turn her mouse up the right way on her desk'.  


The Answer: The previous user had brought in their own ergonomic mouse where your hand rests basically sideways and left it behind when they departed. Simple job to fix at least!",1,1631155212
2022,The card IS in the box.,"So I currently work for a retail department store (the one with the big yellow spark on the blue background) in the electronics department. It's not officially tech support but I get the same ~~idiots~~ customers and Karens you do. And on a strictly unofficial basis we do minor phone support mostly how do I add my minutes (call 611), how do I transfer my number (call 611), etc.

Anyway on to the story:

Two players me and id10t who we will call ""goober"" or ""goob"" for short

*Phone rings*


Me: Hello. Electronics.


Goob: yeah I bought a Samsung Galaxy 5G FE for *prepaid carrier*  2 days ago and I need to know what I press on the screen to activate and transfer my number to the new phone.


Me: well first of all you don't do it on the new phone. You call 611 on your old phone.


Goob: yeah but don't they need a serial number or something?


Me: yes sir, all that info is on a red activation card in the box.

Goob: I don't think it's in there it's a small box.

The next two minutes consist of a back and forth of me insisting it's in there and him insisting it isn't. I couldn't understand why he kept insisting it wasn't there you can't miss it. I thought maybe it was an assembly error or something. I was about to suggest he bring it in but that was the ONLY one we had and he bought it. Then suddenly I had a thought but I was thinking no he can't be THAT dense.


Me: Sir have you actually opened the box? 


Goob: no the tape is still around it.


Me (literally facepalming): okay why don't you open the box and see if it's there?


Goob: well hold on I gotta get a pen knife 


Me: ok


He finally comes back, opens the box, and....low and behold the card is in there. We finish up and I hang up.

My first thought: I don't get paid enough for this sh*t. My second thought: I need a beer.


Tl/dr: guy buys the most expensive prepaid cell phone we carry and two days later needs me to tell him to open the box.",1,1631151022

I write you these tales of mirth and woe, of entertainment and anger with as much accuracy and as little embellishment as I can manage. Many conversations are written as best I can remember them from my notes and memories about the incidents they describe, but the heart of what you are about to read is as true as I can make it.

Names have been changed to protect the innocent. And the guilty.

[Episode 4](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/ph93uu/the_new_guy_chronicles_episode_4_up_close_and/)

The cast:

Jordan - FNG

Thomas - Me, the manager and network admin

John - The older of my two other reports, primarily responsible for server maintenance, major application upgrades, and supporting our smaller off-site locations and their specific applications

Daniel - The younger of my two original employees, though here for the same amount of time as John. Both longer than me, actually. Desktop and server support, document management and phone system support, phenomenal people skills.

**DAY 59** - Career Change?

Two months.  Two months of torment and still Jordan lives.  It is truly a testament to the patience and forbearance of myself and my two other employees.  He has continued wallowing in what can only be described as unsettlingly consistent failure.  In some ways he learns.  Some users have described a slight but noticeable improvement, however I and my compatriots see it for what it truly is: trivia.  He learns facts; sometimes he memorizes processes.  He is, however, like a machine.  Without understanding.  Regurgitating answers and performing only the most basic of assigned tasks through sheer rote memorization until his programming goes awry or a stray variable leads him off script and he flounders until rescued and reset.  Yes, he is a machine.  Where a machine has metal, he has meat.  Where a machine has a battery he has iced coffee and 5-hour energy.  And like any simple machine his programming relies on if/then, incapable of straying outside explicit instructions and solving problems.

Occasionally this machine of meat and sadness does attempt to break the bonds of ""if, elseif, else"".  These are invariably dark, troubling, baffling times.  

Again, Jordan is sent to help after an office has been re-arranged.  After some time he called up to our office and in short order I heard the sound of confusion in John's voice.  I stepped out of my office and over to John's desk to listen in.  John asks a question, clearly not understanding what Jordan wants or needs.

""OK, what do you need?""

""A wall plate with an outlet.""

""You mean a network port?""

""No, an outlet.""

I decided to wade into the mire.

""What's the problem, Jordan?""

""Well, the power cord for the printer isn't long enough and I was wondering if we have any wall plates with outlets because there's a blank plate on the wall next to where the printer is now.""

""Ignore that.  Where's another outlet?""

""That's what I'm saying, I don't see one over here but there's a blank plate like maybe there used to be outlets here, but I think they took them out when they moved things around.  I thought if we had any plates with outlets we could put one in.""

""Jordan.  We are not electricians.  We do not have electrical supplies and we do not install outlets.  Find another one.""

""There's not one though.""

""Then where is the computer plugged in?""

I could hear him shift where he was standing or sitting and place the phone against his chest as he asked the user where the computer was plugged in.  I could also hear the incredulity in the user's voice when she answered.

""It's... under the desk.""

""She says it's under the desk.""

I decided to let him think the problem out.

""OK.""

After a few seconds he responded, having apparently realized I was not going to elaborate.

""The cord isn't long enough to reach under the desk.""

""OK.""

Painful seconds passed.

""Do we have any extension cords?""

""Yes, Jordan, we do.""

A couple minutes later Jordan silently passed through our office to the storage area and back out.  He completed the task set before him, and here the tale should end.  As I'm sure you all can guess, however, the end has not quite come.  This is Jordan, after all.  

Daniel was later working on a problem close to the office where Jordan briefly considered a career as an electrician (a career which I'm sure would have been as short-lived, albeit lively) and checked in on the apprentice's work.  Luckily so, because our intrepid young failure-bot had chosen as the solution to bridge the gaping two-foot chasm between the printer's power cord and the outlet - a 15-foot power strip.  This he left, along with the network cable, completely unorganized and strung across the middle of the floor where our dear elderly user could trip over it.  

The mess was cleaned up, photos were taken, and Jordan's metaphorical nose was rubbed in the metaphorical poop on the living room carpet.  Time would pass.  Life would continue.  Seasons would change.  Jordan's problem-solving abilities would not.",1,1631131797
2024,Hiding issues,"This turned into a bit of a rant... enjoy!

I'll never understand why users think they can blame IT for issues they don't tell us about.

The company I work for uses an IBM AS/400 ERP system. The print routing is an absolute nightmare, and one of the departments on my site has been having trouble for years with prints not going to the correct printer.

I've lost count of the hours we've spent with the team leader, following his directions for what he wants, setting up the print tables and troubleshooting why it isn't working. We'll eventually get it sorted and he will say 'yep, that's exactly how I want it.' 

Within a couple months, he's moaning again. Nothing has changed with the configuration, but it's no loner perfect... has he raised a ticket to tell us? Yeah, right.

It got to a point a few months ago that the operations director got involved. I was angry because it made it look like he wasn't getting onsite support and we arranged an entire day to go through the printing issues once again.

That done, and assured by him that it was exactly how he wanted it, we then held 2 months of weekly meetings to make sure there weren't any further issues.

He stopped attending the meetings after the first 2, but the site manager and IT manager continued, so I did too. I also made sure to ask the user every time I saw him if there were any issues. Every time I asked his response was 'It's perfect, thank you!'

Until today - about a month after the final weekly meeting.

'It's never been right, it's always been shit, why can't IT just fix it?'

I'm leaving the company in 10 days to start a new job. I'm pretty maxed with making sure I can give a smooth handover. I don't have time for his BS any more.

'Have you raised a ticket?' I ask.

'What's the point?'

'How on earth do you expect IT to know there is an issue when, for the last 3 months you've told us that it's perfect, unless you raise a ticket? You know exactly what you need to do and you've left it too late for me to fix it, so good luck getting someone to travel down from the head office to help you out.'

I'm generally very patient with users, but I'm got no sympathy for him any more. I feel sorry for my replacement that will have to deal with him - I've been in IT support for 7 years and he is the most frustrating user I've had to deal with.",1,1631128256
2025,Dear director. You get getting a new hard drive. I can do this over lunch or you lose the computer for an entire day. Your call.,"User complains that her laptop is slow. Understandable, reasonable complaint. Hit by the Windows 10 1909 bug which makes any laptop with a mechanical drive unusable with anything other than an SSD because *reasons*. Common problem, common fix - I pop in a SSD and presto! The machine is usable again!

I tell the users - all you have to do is make sure that your files are saved in OneDrive so I can put in a new drive, give you a clean image and you're back up and running in 30, 40 minutes tops. Easy peasy, I do it all the time.

I have one user who **refuses** to put her documents in onedrive. She **NEEDS** them to be on her desktop, it is the only way she can work, they CANNOT be anywhere else. (Desktop sync isn't enabled on her machine and I can't get her to give it up long enough to turn it on.)

So I say we can move them to onedrive, I swap the drive, then we can move them back. **NO!** You cannot put those files in onedrive! I cannot function if those files ever exist anywhere else! Even temporarily!

(I tell all users that I do not back up laptops. If they are worried about important files they need to keep them on onedrive. I had one user who lost critical files because she refused to keep them in onedrive because it was too complicated, then her HDD crashed. A few months later she dropped the laptop and lost critical files again. After that she started keeping everything in OD)

Ok, so if you won't back up your files then I'll clone the drive. Instead of 30 minutes plan on me keeping the laptop for 8 hours. Or stay with the slow drive. You have three choices here, one gives you a faster drive and keeps important files safe, the other two do not. Your choice.

So she sighed and got all snotty but handed in her laptop. Before I had a chance to start the cloning process I got sidetracked with a major system outage, a CxO with an urgent state-required problem, a user who was pissed that I was asking her to walk 20 feet to the next printer because the one she wanted to used was just delivered and not fully configured yet (and copped an attitude because scanning 120 pages in full color results in a file too large to send via email), had two walkthroughs with cabling contractors, an HR director who didn't understand why she couldn't access the files that were saved in an underling's personal onedrive folder after said user left and her account was turned off, a printer that wasn't working until the tech got here then stopped working again the moment he left, had to complete the training of a key employee because the person who was supposed to do the training didn't finish and a few others things.

Two hours into the 8 hour window I had given the first user - before I had even had a chance to start on the cloning process the ""the world will end unless this file is on my desktop!"" user demanded her laptop back right that second because she had an important meeting. She was lucky I hadn't started yet so I told her to just take it back. I'll deal with it later.

I'm going to miss the chaos. I thrive in this kind of environment. Good luck finding somebody to replace me.

2028,"Every time I'm here the network sucks! Fix it! aka: sometimes correlation is causation, and there are 802.5 things wrong with this picture.","Martin was a manager at humungocorp, overseeing a bunch of engineers. I'm not exactly sure what he did, but he had a cube office that took up the space of two cubes and had a door.

Martin would show up around 10-11am and leave around 2-3pm. While in the office he heard a lot of grumbling from his charges about how poor the network is. Oddly, he never heard any complaints about slow network when he wasn't around, but that could have been because he wasn't there.

But no, in this case there was a pretty clear patterns: on most days when Martin showed up the network would grind to a halt, and would pick back up again when he left to go play golf or do vodka shooters at the bikini bar down the street or whatever he did. Still not 100% proof that he was involved because lots of engineers came in lateish and left earlyish, but suspicions were forming.

One day Martin raised enough of a stink about his poor network speed that deskside was dispatched to his cubifce where the tech found him receiving adoring fawning from other engineers who were amazed at this cool new thing he had discovered and loaded all on his own.

He's a vip, I'm not willing to fight his expectations so by the end of the day there is an i7-11000 with 16GB of memory and a shiny nvme drive. It doesn't get any faster until you change the first digit of the purchase price to a 3.

I let him know that he has to come in to pick it up. He has to log in to the domain before he can take it home and I don't do house calls.

I tried the nice approach and called them back via caller ID to inform them that they have the wrong number and no one at our number goes by ""Bob"". They said they would take care of it. They didn't.

So, not so nice approach invoked. I programmed our phone system to route calls from their caller ID right back to them on the same number. Now they are receiving the same annoying calls daily and I'm kind of hoping they don't figure out how it is happening. 

I just checked and can confirm that 10 calls have been routed this way since August 27th with the most recent being today so they havent figured it out yet.

2032,Why our tech support guy wasn't allowed to talk to customers any more.,"The year was long ago. It was my first IT job and I was working at a small national chain of computer stores. I was the assembler: every day I would build 8 custom PCs from scratch, load them and set them to burn. I had a good chuckle at the people who would be conned into buying the ""premium"" line which meant that for a few hundred dollars more your case had a strip of gold plastic trim on it. Other than that, same components right down to the motherboard.

Bill (or whatever his name was, that's good enough for the story) was the repair guy. People would bring their PCs in for service, repairs, cleaning some of the thickest coats of nicotine imaginable, removing the occasional dead mouse from the case, and yes, fixing broken cup holders (which really did happen). He was good at what he did, but was kind of short of patience.

One day a customer brought in his PC complaining that his CD was stuck in the computer and he couldn't get it out. Should be an easy fix. Bill took the computer to the bench where he promptly discovered that the customer had embarked on a fascination journey of discover upon which he learned that a CD is slightly larger than a 5 1/2"" floppy bay because the two have absolutely nothing to do with each other. However, he had been determined and used a rubber mallet to get his very first CD ever to fit in the slot which was tight because it was new and not broken in yet.

Bill was not particular diplomatic in conveying his opinion of the customer's intelligence to said customer.

After that there was a new rule: if there was ever a customer who had done anything even slightly stupid, Bill was no longer allowed to speak with the customer but was to call me over the counter to deal with the situation.",1,1631063614
2033,Now you are the story,"Prolog: Back in the 90s I had a small consulting group that fixed computers, created networks, etc.   One Wed a client called me saying they haven't been able to print since Friday.   I run over, ask them to print something (can I hear anything?) and check the cable from the PC to the printer.  All is fine there, then I look at the front of the HP printer; ""HP Load Letter""  (DOS days, WP 5.1)   I pulled the paper tray out and held out the two sides; ""you're out of paper""   Sort of understandable in the time, DOS/WP 5.1, since the software didn't tell the users.  But still kinda stupid to not check that.

Incident: A few years later I got a gig at a large bank.  I was the sol IT for this dept.  People would say to me when I came to help; ""I'm sorry, I'm just stupid."" and would generally just tell them; ""no, you're just ignorant of these things, that's ok, it's not your job.  That's why I'm here to help/fix these things, no worries.""  I would then tell them of the people who didn't even bother to check the printer paper.  (always made them feel better  ""at least I'm not THAT stupid""

Then after a couple of months my group got merged into a larger group in another build and now there was a ticket system (YAY!)  as well as other techs to help.  But now I had three buildings to cover.   Just as I was heading to another building a person came up to me absolutely frantic. ""I can't print, I need this NOW.""   I informed them that they HAVE to put in a ticket, it's not just me now.  Cue more yelling and freaking out.   So, sadly, I gave in... cause I knew it was going to be this easy. (Remember, we had just moved)  I walk into the room, reach down and pick up the power cord that wasn't plugged in and said; ""Remember those stories of stupid people, now you're one of them."" and dropped the plug on the floor and walked out.

2034,"Sorry, your computer is not compatible with your desk","I was pimped out to supermegacorp, supporting a manufacturing complex (one big enough that they had rail tracks passing through the building so they could load product directly into the freight cars rain, shine or now). I got a call from the engineering annex, about a mile down the road from the main campus about a computer that was repeatedly crashing, throwing errors and generally being temperamental.

I get there and reproduce the error. Pull the computer off the engineer's desk and onto a convenient work surface, open it up, everything works fine so no pinched cables. Put it back on the desk  and the problems return.

Moved it to the adjacent desk thinking it might be something wrong with the outlet, works fine. Before moving it back I ran power into the outlet closest to the engineer with the problem, worked fine, so not the outlet.

After some more fiddling I started to pay attention to the desk itself: a nice top of the line stainless steel surface that might have been a drafting table at some point. An idea flashed into my head.

I took my multimeter and checked - 3V between the computer and the desk surface. Problem found.

I was in a building filled with mechanical and electrical engineers who knew exactly what to do and had the parts to do it. They grounded the desk to something (don't tell skilled trades, they'd be pissed if the electrician was cut out of a chance to make overtime) and everybody lived happily ever after.",1,1631054016

Someone reached out to me on Teams for an ask. This is not unusual, as I work in systems support. What was unusual was that they included 4 other people to the chat as if this was soke sort of emergency meeting of great importance.

$User: ""Hi, how are you?""

Now, my company is not huge, but it is owned by a bigger company I have no direct contact with. So, given how impersonal the initial message is, and the fact that I don't recognize any of the names in the chat, it takes me a while to realize they are addressing me personally. I just assumed I got added by mistake to a chat from Business Daddy and doesn't concern me. 

However, upon further inspection, I see the contacts have my company's domain, so I ask: 

$Me: ""Hi $User, are you talking to me? There are so many people in the chat, so I'm not sure.""

Turns out they do. They need help with the resolution of 2 images they have in a Word document, as it looks grainy, and that report is urgent as they need it for an important investors meeting. I reply: 

$Me: ""Sure, can you send an email to [support team]@[company name].com with the document in question?""

$User: ""$Lackey, can you provide $Me with that?""

$Lackey: ""I'll send the file shortly""

Now, does $Lackey email [support team]@[company name]? Of course not, he emails me directly and CC's every name under the sun. 

Sigh.... whatever, I do point that out, but who cares at this point. I check the file, there's nothing I can do with the images embedded, so I ask for the original images to see if I can insert them in a higher resolution.

It's been a week since and I haven't heard back from anyone... I guess that investors meeting wasn't that important.

Now, am I the only one who gets annoyed at managers dealing with tiny requests as if it was DefCon5, organizing meetings for things that can be addressed in an email? Is this how micromanagers act in the wild?

I'd like to point out that no one other than $User and $Lackey said anything in the chat. This could've been raised by $Lackey directly, but seeing how they couldn't even manage to send an email to the proper recipient, maybe I expect too much from them.",1,1631034492

2041,you need what? customer looses install media . . .,"This is another tale from ""awhile"" ago.  My company had sold a computer system to a military base about 4 hours driving from my main base.  No problem, I didn't have to visit often, maybe once or twice a year.

Then the customer needed the system relocated into a different building (your tax dollars at work).    I had to make a visit to inspect the new building, estimate the cost for moving, all that jazz.  Anyway, I managed this project and we got paid a lot to do it so everyone was happy.

Then Something Happened.   Several months after we did the relocation the system (System V Unix running a very small minicomputer) died.   Our help desk folks we able to figure out it was probably the hard drive (only one in this system), so they called me, we all figured out when I could get there, a replacement drive was shipped, all good.  I had an extensive conversation with the customer that we'd need their backup tapes (duh), plus the OS tape that came with the system, along with some extra tapes that had additional packages that we required.  I was assured they had everything.  They even had a safe that the kept all the tapes in.

I got up early next day and did the 4 hour drive, got to the new building, unboxed the new drive and had it installed in less than hour.  Hardware was not the most ""repair friendly"" design.  I then asked the customer for the tapes, they hand me a stack of their application backups.  OK, we'll need those later, where are tapes with the OS, the ones that came with the system?  Blank stares.  They check the safe, not there.  They had not unpacked all the boxes from moving into the new building so they start tearing into these.   I call the help desk, is there anything we can do?  Nope, need the tapes.

Customer spends a couple of hours digging through boxes, calling people who are not there and asking them, bickering about who's job it was to pack things up.  I'm kind of stuck, the disk installed is raw, no way to boot at all except off a tape (no floppy or optical on this system, your choice of scsi devices only, which you can select during the POST.

Finally the customer throws up their hands, they have no idea where the tapes are.  I'm on the phone with the support folks, what do we do?  Make them buy a new set?  How long will that take?  My support buddy finally just says he'll make a copy from tapes he has in the office, he knows which ones I need.  We don't know if we're allowed to do this, but we're in a jam.  I find out where the nearest airport is, a city an hour away.   He'll copy the tapes and get them on a plane to me.  I tell the customer what the deal is (they are really grateful), hop in my car and drive to the airport, find the air freight office, package has not arrived.  I take a seat and read a book.

At last, the plane lands, they hand me my package, I rip it open and confirm I have tapes!  My support buddy (great guy) has come through.   Back in my car and race back to the base.  Boot off the OS tape, hooray it works.  Have to actually partition the drive, entering various geometry  factors, then format it, then install the OS!  It works.  Reboot off the disk, all good, install optional software from the other tapes, various sysgen and reboots required.  Finally, re-install my company's application files, plus customer's database.  Now its way too late to drive home.

Spent the night in a motel and headed home the next day after checking in with the customer.  All good.   I don't know what we did about replacing the tapes, I didn't have to deal with that, I'm guessing we just let them keep the copies.",1,1630964166
2042,Can’t connect to Remote Desktop,"A few weeks ago was my turn to be on-call. Our current implementation is crap as calls don’t actually seem to be going to our phones like they should, so I have a habit of just manually checking my email and messenger throughout the day while I’m scheduled to be on-call.

That Sunday, I awoke and found an email from someone who called the support line saying that she couldn’t access the remote server because there was an error.

I called her immediately (the call took place about an hour before I checked when I woke up) and the user picked up the phone.

&gt;Me: Hi, this is LittleWing from $CompanyIT returning your call for after hours support. Are you still having difficulty accessing the remote server?

&gt;User: Yes I am, thanks for calling me back.

&gt;Me: What seems to be the issue?

&gt;User: There seems to be this error that won’t let me log in.

&gt;Me: What does the error say?

&gt;User: Hold on and let me try again.

I bring up the remote tool so I can remote in with her to view her screen. She accepts my invitation to share screen and I watch as she opens the Remote Desktop app and try to log in.

&gt;User: See, that’s the error right there.

I start reading. Don’t remember the exact phrasing of the error, but it went along the lines of it not wanting to connect because it needed an update.

&gt;Me: Okay, can you close that window for me?

Once the error window was closed, there was a light blue banner on the Remote Desktop window that said “Update to the latest version of Remote Desktop”.

&gt;	Me: Do you see that blue banner? Have you tried clicking that and letting it update?

&gt;User: Oh my goodness…I didn’t even see that.

User clicks the banner and Remote Desktop begins updating.

We wait about 2 minutes, at most, for it to finish.

&gt;Me: Now can you please try to connect again?

User clicks to connect again and it lets her in.

I stay on just to verify that she’s connected and then end the call.",1,1630961214
2043,When they can't tell the difference,"I'm just your average guy and my dad needed some help. Of course I'd help.

The issue was, that his banking application disappeared from the taskbar. OK, not the first time he called me when something ""just vanished"" from the taskbar. I don't like working with that machine, because a toaster has more computing power. Opening anything makes that thing unresponsive for 30 seconds, but I'm just going to but it back quickly and nope.

The app was somehow bugged and wouldn't start and it didn't show up in Taskmanager. Nothing a quick PC restart won't fix. Yeah, that toaster isn't you latest rig, just restarting that piece of crap took about 3/4 hours. And Windows updates didn't sped up the process. And it didn't even help.

Now an hour had passed and I didn't make any progress. The old man had long since lost patience and started to watch his sports game, but unbeknown to me that did turn out into my favour. He stopped looking over my shoulder. After some more fruitless troubleshooting I made the decision to just reinstall the program.

&amp;#x200B;

Uninstalled and rein, wait where are the original downloaded files, damn his download folder is empty. I go to the banks website and voilà there are only mobile app files and none for Windows. They discontinued their application for desktops.

I was out of options now... the original files are gone and I can't get new ones. So I had to gamble on my dads ineptitude.

I created a Chrome shortcut to the banks homepage and started praying.

My dad clicked the shortcut and the ""App"" started. He couldn't tell them apart",1,1630957890
2044,CPU Temperature issues.,"Hi,

So recently I've noticed that my temps on my CPU have gone up to 85 degrees playing Call of duty.

Now as of right now, i'm not particularly quite sure if it's the airflow in my case (Phanteks Eclipse P400S Closed panel) or if it needs just the thermal paste replacing. Normally i play games Like Call Of Duty at around 50-70 degrees while using a AMD Wraith stealth stock cooler with pre-applied thermal paste.

If i was to replace the thermal paste can i replace it in the case? i've seen videos on how to do it but the backplate falls off and I'm really like cautious of taking the motherboard out of the case. and i've been told that depending on the motherboard the backplate will not fall off?

2047,I really didn't mean to do that,"I obtained my Certified Novell Adminstrator qualification for Novell Netware 3 way back when the servers booted into MS-DOS before loading Netware. I was the Systems Supervisor (job title) for the UK offices of a South Korean container shipping company. I worked out of the office in the port of Felixstowe, Suffolk. The network was a Novell 3.11 server (Intel 80386 with a whopping 1GB hard drive) that took care of about 45 workstations running MS-DOS/Windows for Workgroups 3.11 connected on coax cable runs.

About a year into the job and head office gifted us with an upgrade to Netware 4.1 (a CD install! No more swapping out of 25 3 inch floppies for an installation) and I was overjoyed. This network was going to be so easy to manage once the installation was completed.

As there was only the one server, I stayed late after everyone had signed out and left for the day. Step one - insert MS-DOS disk 1 and proceed to format the hard drive and install MS-DOS. Step two - insert CD containing Netware 4.1 and run setup.exe. Step three - configure the installation once Netware was installed.

Everything was going as planned. Network volumes set up, printers/print queues created, user login scripts and network shares created. Just have the users/usernames to create and I'll be done in no time.

Started creating usernames as the first letter of  first name and then last name. Then about half way through ran into a problem when several users had same last name and first letter if first name happened to be the same. Can't have this. What to do? I'll just use a different  naming protocol. That's what I'll do.

Started to delete each username individually, but then thought that's going to take more time to finish. I know! I'll just use the old wildcard '\*' so I won't have to fully type each username. Might as well start with the a's. Go into the user directory and type ""del a\*.\*"" and hit enter. As I did I suddenly remembered the user directory also contained the username for the system administrator, happens to be ""admin""! I just deleted the only way to manage/create/delete anything on the server. I had a fully functional Netware 4.1 server and absolutely no way to do anything with it.

Only recovery option available - insert MS-DOS disk 1 and reboot. Start all over again. I managed to get it all completed and running by the time day shift arrived the next morning.",1,1630894678
2048,"The Box is dead, long live the Box","We were  doing a server swap at work; a bunch of production systems going from one server to another, overnight. All hands are on deck at midnight, except your humble correspondent, because I'm not on the server team, I'm doing remote support.

I roll in at 8am to complete the one, important, task assigned to me: change the IP address on this legacy coms device so that it points at the new server, or else certain crucial systems will stop working. I did this six months ago during the first swap, it's not complicated. I find the beige metal box in the server room and note the outdated labels on it, notably ""Configured 8/5/2004."" The flickering LCD display tells me that it's processed 0 bytes of data since the last reboot six months ago.

Well, if it works it works, I guess. These things are important, someone would complain if they stopped working. A few minutes later I get an email that says they're not seeing the connection, have I completed the configuration? Well, I thought I did. I go back to the server room, double check, then triple check. Yep, all good. 

Server guys tell me to stand by for further instructions, so I wait a bit then get an email from the server team: “this system was switched over to (external solution provider) a few months ago, you can e-waste this device.”

2051,The dark day a customer service agent got carte blanche from IT to do to a live serverrack whatever he wanted...,"Sooo... I work at a weird company. I work as a second line, specialized CS agent in a call center. About two years ago we moved to a new building across town. Manglement thought it'd be a great idea to move the desks, computers (thin clients is the correct term I think), all the network cabling/switches that were on the ground and move it to the new building on the other side of town while the entire callcenter was still live at that moment and was supposed to continue working. Of course nobody from IT was present so we the CS people had to do all of this. Yeah, that was a grand success...  /s

One person showed up from IT, moved the serverracks in position, connected 8 workspaces (out of 60 workplaces+8 meeting rooms). Because I was slightly less tech illiterate and had slightly better Google skills then the rest of the CS I had to figure out how it all worked, needed to be connected and set up the switches in the racks, connect everything through trial and error etc. Eventually it all worked. 

Anyway. This was to give you an idea of the weird ideas that manglement have here about IT and the lack of IT knowledge/persons on location. 

About three weeks ago we lost all internet and phone systems (VoIP) early in the morning. The closest IT person was about three hours away and not much help. The amount of information we got from them was ""Internet is down and it's on your end."" Not much help because that's about as far as we'd gotten. After that 'insight' from him he hung up...

When we reached him again he basically shrugged it off with the comment that he'd done all he could and that we were on our own. On the question what we were supposed to do since the entire CS and backoffice people were out of internet he basically shut us down. ""Do whatever you want or need to do to fix it. Good luck and let me know when you fix it or if you need anything.""

I'm honestly still gobsmacked by that lack of care. He was useful in the sense that he agreed to email this permission to us so we had it in writing. (Thanks to you people I learned the importance of CYA when shit has the potential to hit the fan).  

After unplugging and replugging basically every cable and rebooting the rack/switches multiple times it started working. Still don't know why to be honest.

2055,Three truths and no lies,"So this is first post on this subreddit. These are all pretty old and a somewhat short, but painful nonetheless. I work help desk for a pretty big hospital system for context.

&amp;#x200B;

So first one was maybe a year into me work help desk. I get the call and the user proceeds to tell me that she broke the cup holder off the computer. I started laughing as I have heard the myth. She goes ""why are you laughing I broke the cup holder and I need a new one?"" 

I realize that she was serious. She genuinely believed that the CD tray was a cup holder. It was on a cart and she had been using the tray to hold her coffee as she moved around the unit giving the patients medicine. 

I checked later and the tech had closed the ticket stating that she did actually snap the tray off completely. She was using a ceramic cup and put it down too hard and broke it. Obviously a new drive had to be installed. 

About a year ago I ran into a consultant that had a user do that at one of his old places.  Seriously is this more common than I thought it was?

&amp;#x200B;

Second story is in a similar vein. User calls about some issue. I tell her to take her mouse and move it across the screen to click on something. She tells me that now her mouse isn't working too. I ask a few questions and realize that she actually had taken the mouse and was trying to move the physical mouse on the screen. I had to explain to her that pointer on screen was also the mouse. 

She admitted that she was confused why I asked her to put the mouse on the screen, but decided to just go with it. I guess it was just a lapse in judgement but it definitely worried me.

&amp;#x200B;

The final one kills me to this day. So when I can in they were doing the xp to 7 upgrade. This is a massive company so literally thousands of computers.  It got stalled but they started it up again after I had started. 

They apparently hired a consultant company on recommendation from one of the higher ups. They were not good. Computers not configured to connect to the network. No Programs installed at all or installed improperly. No printers be connected or installed with drivers for the wrong make/model. Devices not being set up for us to remote on to. They basically messed so often and badly  we always knew where they were working because we would get a flood of calls from those floors for all sorts of random issues we couldn't remote on to fix anything either, requiring desktop to come fix it. 

Well I thought it couldn't get any worse until one day a user calls up and says ""Hey my printer is installed as a CD"". I thought they were confused because no one could mess up that bad right? Nope! It was one of the few PCs they actually did get the remote set up on. And yes the had somehow installed a printer on the computer as a CD drive. The drive was labeled as a printer and when they turned the printer off and on, the drive disappeared. 

I called over my colleagues and they were just as shocked and horrified as I was. We also all thought it was hilarious as well. About 2 years ago I actually ran into another like that. I never thought I would run into another printer as a CD drive in my life.

And for those curious the higher up that recommended them, the issue was ""sorted out"" and ""dealt with"".",1,1630718930
2056,“How long has it been like this?” and why no news != good news,"The Backdrop: I work at a very small (Less than 10 employees, half PT) non-profit in a general technology role (A/V, Design, video, etc) but since I am one of two employees who can whisper sweet nothings to electronics and woo them to (usually) do my bidding, I also have filled the role of IT. 

Most of the time once a user is set up as needed they can operate all the programs they need without issue 99% of the time (A huge blessing), or they message me directly. Only other time I hear from them is when they are due for a scheduled upgrade once every couple years and I peruse the overpriced fruit products to find their replacement. Now to the fun.

Participants:

* $ME - Understands technology too much for my own good
* $PD - Program Director
* $EP - Employee

I’m toiling away under our media desk T-10 minutes to a live broadcast, trying to convince a stubborn HDMI switch to just work for the next hour pretty please, when $EP places a laptop on the desk. As I look up at them I can tell that something troublesome is coming.

&gt;$EP: “PD needs to print, can you install the printer on this laptop?”  
&gt;  
&gt;*With a puzzled look I glance at the device in question*  
&gt;  
&gt;$ME: “I could but why? This isn’t their laptop, pretty sure it’s their department media laptop.” (Only staff devices get print access)  
&gt;  
&gt;$EP: “I don’t know, she said it’s broken and she needs to print right away!”  
&gt;  
&gt;$ME: “I can’t do that now, we’re going live soon I’ll look at it after.”

With that out of the way and a small amount of strategic percussive maintenance applied, the broadcast went smoothly. I return to the main office and wait for $PD who arrives shortly.

&gt;$PD: “Are you done installing the printer?”  
&gt;  
&gt;$ME: “Not yet,” I hadn’t even started, “First, is there an issue with your laptop?”  
&gt;  
&gt;$PD: “Well it’s slow and not working right anymore…”

Okay… I think to myself. It’s an old fruit themed device so that’s not completely wrong but what could they possibly be doing beyond office soft…

&gt;$PD: “and the camera is broken.”  
&gt;  
&gt;*Wait what?*  
&gt;  
&gt;$PD: “and the microphone doesn’t work”  
&gt;  
&gt;*that’s not too bad…*  
&gt;  
&gt;$PD: “and there side is broken so I can’t use the plugs anymore”  
&gt;  
&gt;*oh no*  
&gt;  
&gt;$PD: “and I can only use it for 30 minutes without charging, it’s a *huge* hassle”  
&gt;  
&gt;*please no.*

&gt;  
&gt;*internal screaming commences*  
&gt;  
&gt;$PD: “So I took this one last month and started using it instead. Can you put the printer on this one please?”

As the internal volume within my fading consciousness begins to lower I rack my brain as to what the polite response would be.

&gt;$ME: “Could you bring your laptop here so I can look at it?”

It’s about as bad I expected. The glass around the camera area was cracked, the metal frame in some spots had broken and bent to block the USB &amp; ethernet ports (but firewire was good to go!) and the pièce de résistance: a voluptuous bottom bulge would make some influencers jealous. I don’t want to know how it got like that so I don’t bother asking why.

&gt;$ME: “How long has it been like this?”

&gt;$PD: “Since just after the lockdowns…”  
&gt;  
&gt;*consciousness fades*  
&gt;  
&gt;$PD: “but I just used my tablet mostly, which was a little frustrating, but now I need to print.”

This was just recently so for almost 16 months the user has had this issue. I’ve talked with them almost every week since the lockdowns for other stuff that I do but never once did they think to bring up their broken laptop to maybe get it looked at and replaced. This is opposite to previous workplaces where I would get the same user over and over again screaming about a non-issue *issue*. I was truly speechless.

 Employee: “when I try to print it just says ‘toner cartridge low’ and doesn’t let me print. Is there any way to bypass that?”

So I take a quick gander and there is not in fact any way to bypass it as I had suspected. Also the cartridge is bone dry so even if I could bypass it, it wouldn’t do any good. 

 Me: ”Let me go check the storage room just to be sure, but I really don’t think we have one.”

So I go check the storage room to see if we have Any and lo and behold we don’t. So I call my boss to be ABSOLUTELY sure. 

 Boss: ”What’s up?” 
 Me: ”I’m looking at this printer and I can’t find toner for it anywhere. Do we even carry this brand?”
 Boss: ”No we don’t. That’s one they purchased themselves without consulting IT to see if it’s supported so they’re on the hook for that one.”
 Me: ”Got it boss.”

So I walk back to the Lab to find the employee and break the news.

 Employee: “Oh I thought y’all would have one. Since y’all do tech and stuff.”

 Employee: “… Oh I was asking because I didn’t want to have to go to Purchasing and have our department pay for it”

**DAY 34** - Up Close and Personal

A month in, and still Jordan haunted our waking hours.  In the intervening time since Episode 3 I had to discuss honesty and trust with him once again, after he failed a test that, due to sub rules, I shall not elaborate on other than to say it involves phishing.  Suffice to say I had grown more than weary of his presence, as had his coworkers.  Nevertheless, he was still an employee and I still had work that needed doing.  The work of the day was moving a PC for a user.

Jordan was sent to another floor to move a PC for a user whose office was being rearranged.  A simple enough task were it assigned to someone with more aptitude for, well, anything really.  During the process he had to call back down to our office for help hooking up the VOIP phone and her printer.  Alas, this tale is less about deficiencies in Jordan's technical acumen, and more about those in other areas.  Namely, how to be a functioning human.  This would become a theme over the next few months.

After moving the computer to the new area Jordan assured me that everything went smoothly.  Time would tell another story because shortly afterward Laura called me personally.  She asked a few questions about moving things around and making sure it wouldn't cause problems.  I explained that if she needed to move anything she could either just unplug them and move them herself to where she liked, or that we could come and assist.  She told me that she would take care of it herself, but expressed her frustration that Jordan had left her desk in a state of disarray, with cables strung across out in the open and nothing organized at all.  I told her that I would address the issue and she thanked me, but I could tell there was something else bothering her.

""Is that all you needed?  Is everything else alright?""

""No; it's fine.  He's just a little awkward I think"" 

""OK.  Anything in particular?""

""No; nothing to worry about.  I'll get this all sorted out.""

I wondered for a while at what had been bothering her when I got a call from Sarah, Laura's coworker.  Sarah was a straight-shooter with a sharp tongue.  She liked me and IT in general, and would sometimes bring snacks down to us for no other reason than that.  Sarah also had the pleasure of briefly having Jordan as an intern the summer prior to his hiring in our department.  She knew the score.

""Hey, Sarah.  What's up?""

""You're not going to like this.""

*sigh*

""Alright, shoot.""

""You know how Jordan was up here moving Laura's computer?""

""Yeah, she just called frustrated that he'd left everything a mess.  Said he was a little awkward, too.""

""He was more than awkward.""

""Oh?""

""Did she tell you that she hid from him?""

""What?!  No.""

""Look, she said he didn't do anything inappropriate, but he doesn't understand personal space very well.""

""Yeah, we've noticed that.""

""I'm sure you have.  He didn't get it when he worked for me either.  But whatever it was she told him that she had a meeting and then came to my office to hide from him until he was done.""

""Ah.  Well that's a problem.""

""I just wanted you to know.""

""I appreciate it.""

Well, I knew we'd have to have this conversation sooner or later.  The others and I had noticed Jordan didn't seem to understand the concept of personal space.  We'd call him over to show him something, and instead of standing off to the side to watch our screens he would hover directly behind us and lean over, inches from our shoulder and face.  When coughing or sneezing he wouldn't cover his mouth.  When talking to you he'd stand uncomfortably close.  Fixing this problem would take more tact than I could muster, and frankly I didn't want to deal with it.  Fixing this problem would require...

His mother.  

""Hi, Sherry.""

""Hey, Thomas!  How is Jordan doing?""

""Well, that's why I'm here.""

""Is something wrong?""

""Well... This is a little awkward and I'm not completely sure how to handle it to be honest.  There have been a couple complaints that Jordan doesn't seem to understand and respect personal space.""

I went on to relay the gist of the story above, with names redacted.  

""Is everything else going OK with him?""

""We did have one incident where he had a password written on a sticky note and when I asked him about it he falsely said that Daniel had told him to write it down.""

""Oh dear.""

""I had a frank conversation with him about honesty and trust.""

""OK.  Anything else?""

""The only other thing that comes to mind is a couple weeks ago he said he thought he could build a computer.  I gave him the parts he needed to make it happen and he needed a lot of help to get it together.  After it was done he'd made a mistake that kept the computer from working again.  It wasn't a big deal, since we were going to toss that one anyway, but after the fact - even knowing it wouldn't work again - he told us 'Well at least I got most of it right.'""

*laughing*  ""Oh, that does sound like him.  I'll talk to him about personal space later.  Thank you.""

Treated like any other employee, huh.  Sure.",1,1630688026
2063,Getting yelled at by my LT in Iraq for doing my Job,"A little background on me. I was an Indirect Fire Infantryman (mortarman) in the Army in the late 00's early 10's. I deployed to Iraq in 2008. At the time I was a the platoon RTO (**radio telephone operator)** / FDC (Fire Direction Computer). I was in charge of our radios and basically any technology in our platoon used. I had no formal training I was just learning on the fly. 

In Iraq, we were assigned some new vehicles called MRAPs. We had Strykers and Humvess back in Alaska but these were new. As such, I didn't know much about them other than how to drive them. One of my duties though was to change the comsec out of each of the radios as we needed. I knew changeover was coming and we were using our vehicles to travel back to the main base. I loaded up the vehicles that were known to me and went to the MRAP last. 

I went to fill the radios and all was good. However, I always did a radio check afterwards to make sure everything worked the way it should. I had hopped in the vehicle, disassembled what I needed to, and then reassembled the way it came apart. Or so I thought. When I conducted the radio check, I noticed that no matter what channel I put the internal comms on, it would only transmit on the top radio. Both Channel A and Channel B would only transmit on radio A. I couldn't figure out why. 

I informed the Staff Sergeant going on the convoy that I couldn't figure out what was going on. I could hear chatter from both radios but could only transmit on the one. He told me to speak with the commo guys and see if we could figure out the issue. 

When it came time for the convoy, I let my Platoon Leader know the issue and that if he wanted to speak on the other channel he'd have to manually change the frequency on the A radio to transmit or let one of the other trucks know to respond. He acknowledged and on we went. 

I was up in the turret manning a machine gun and noticed my PL getting more and more frustrated with having to change the frequency and messing with the radios. We then get to the main base and he calls me to the back of the truck. He proceeds to put me at attention and just lay into me. He basically said I had failed and that I endangered us all because I hadn't done the basic tasks of getting the radios filled and I could have caused the deaths of all of us because I was too lazy to do my job. Something to that affect. After about what felt like forever (probably more like 5 minutes) of being chewed out, that Staff Sergeant from earlier intervened and let him know it was a known issue and that I was to go to the Commo guys and troubleshoot. Which I was then dismissed and I sprinted to the commo shack to get out of there. 

After trouble shooting with the commo guy, we realized the MRAPs didn't have the same radio rack as the Humvees and couldn't transmit through the second radio without the B radio being plugged into a separate cord.  When I put the radios back together, I plugged that cord for the B radio into the A radio and that's why it looped. I felt really dumb and should have troubleshot that myself. 

My PL did apologize to me later for blowing up when he didn't know the whole story.",1,1630684079
2064,Why do I even write documentation?,"This is more of a general rant than a story of a specific incident because this happens ALL THE DAMN TIME.

I'm a web developer who specializes with a particular CMS and would frequently get client requests to provide them with Excel reports of the data that's in their CMS for various things. Several years ago, after writing a few quick and easy but un-reusable export admin tools, I decided to make a reusable tool that could handle any and all of these export requests so that I would never have to write another custom export tool again. So I did, it took me several months and I've been refining and adding to it for the past 5 years. Thanks to my tool I actually was awarded with the CMS's MVP Technology Award and have been an MVP for the past four years now.

I made this tool as simple and user-friendly as possible so that any CMS user should be able to understand how to use it and be able to export data (that they have Read access to). Absolutely no technical skills required beyond what any CMS user already has. The tool itself has an explanation on every single field, but I also wrote out complete documentation on my personal blog for how to use it, which is linked to from the Github repo.

So then all my clients started using it and never asked me for data exports again!

Haha, just kidding. This is how it usually goes:

Client: We need to know all of the pages that have been created in the CMS under this folder. Can you provide us with this? (note: this is the most basic possible export)

Me: Hi client, you can use the export tool that I've told you about 12 times over the past 3 years to pull that information. Here's the link to the documentation (though you probably would realize you don't even need it if you just tried opening the export tool and looking at it)

Client: Thanks. Can we schedule a meeting so that you can explain to us how to use the tool? In the meantime, can you please generate the report for us?

Me: (to my project manager) Hi PM, you can use the export tool to generate that report they're asking for. 

PM: Sure. I've never used it before though. Can you show me how it works?

......

Then eventually, several months or years later, the PM finally tries the tool (not the client though, they will never ever use it because it's easier for them to just ask us for all the data they need and wait up to 5 days to get it rather than spend 2 minutes getting it themselves). The PM messages me on slack to rave about how great the tool is. However, this only fills me with anger rather than joy because I KNOW IT'S GREAT, THAT'S WHY I TOLD YOU TO USE IT FIVE YEARS AGO.",1,1630683406
2065,Look for the Pattern,"*(Posting again, because the Reddit gods somehow decided this was nothing to do with tech support. If analysing and resolving a network issue isn't tech support then I don't know what is.)*

The comment ""seeing commonality of errors"" in a recent post reminded me of this, which happened 8 summers ago. (""summer"" had a significance, it turned out.)

Every afternoon my home broadband service would go off, and would not reappear until early in the evening. This was more than just an irritation as I worked from home at the time. (By coincidence, trying to do network support for my own company.) Over the next couple of months a seemingly endless stream of engineers came to call, and between them gradually replaced every single bit of network and telephony equipment in or near the house. And still every day the broadband service died for several hours. I kept trying to ask if they had checked for incidents further up the line, but they were adamant that the problem had to be specific to my house.

Time to start providing my own tech support to the network engineers. I set up some low-level network monitoring, to see if I could see any pattern, such as bursts of error packets, or specific timings of events. I collected data for two weeks, wrote up a large report, with graphs, tables, and lists of all the ""fixes"" that weren't, and sent it to the engineering team. I also asked the question whether anybody else had reported a similar problem.

A couple of days later I got a call from one of the engineers. It was a slow, drawn-out conversation in the style of somebody feeling extremely guilty and trying not to get to the point of confession.

$engineer: ""I'm calling from the local telephone exchange...""

2071,The Right Mouse Button?,"I work IT helpdesk at a university, and thought you guys might find this mildly entertaining, if not frustrating.

This time of year we get many requests for account resets, unlocks, and just general access assistance as students shake of the rust of summer and prepare for the semester. This particular university has a high percentage of older students as well(older being over 30). Students, particularly the older students, tend to call in very stressed over what is normally a very simple issue. Most of my job around this time is usually more focused on calming the user down enough to walk them through what they have to do to gain account access.

One call I received from an older gentleman went like this:

Me: You've reached (University help desk), how can I assist you today?
User: Your system isn't working.
Me: What seems to be the issue sir?
User: It won't go, it's not doing what its supposed to do!
Me: Ok, well.. what system are your working with?
User: I'm trying to access my account, but your system is sh*t!
Me: Ok, please provide me with your ID number, and I can take a look at the account.

I get the number, take a look at the account and nothing seems to be wrong.

Me: Sir, are you getting any error messages when you try to log in?
User: No it's just not going. You really need to come up with a better way of doing this.
Me: I understand sir, but lets focus on making sure you can get into the account for now. What happens when you try to log in?
User: You aren't listening to me, nothing happens, it just doesn't work.
Me: Ok. Walk me through it, step by step. You get to the landing page.
User: Yea.
Me: You see the sign in button?
User: Yea.
Me: Ok what happens when you click the sign in button?
User: Nothing! How many times do I have to say it?!
Me: Alright sir, well can you describe to me what you see on the page right now?
User: I just see 'Open link in new page, open link in new tab, save link as...'
Me(mentally): Facepalm. This can't be happening, this has to be a goddam nightmare.
Me(verbally): Sir, when you click on the sign in button, are you clicking the right mouse button or the left mouse button.
User: What the f*ck do you think? I'm clicking the right mouse button.
Me: Um... this is gonna sound weird, but do me a favor and try clicking the left mouse button.
User: Oh wow that worked, I can enter my credentials. You know, you guys really need to fix your goddam system, its really not very obvious what you need to do. Terrible service.

2073,In which the Obvious Matters (Two short tales),"So, I work Tier 1.5 for a US Government agency. In the three years I have been doing my job, I have gone from line soldier to being the back-up lead in my team. We have over two thousand people at my location, so we have a pretty good sized IT team with a pretty good support network. Herein, I have two stories- one of which is me beating my head on a wall for hours, the other of which is me pointing out the obvious. 

Story 1- 'Why is this happening?'

Story one begins when my manager is asked for support to look into an issue that two senior windows developers cannot solve. Whenever this user is trying to open VMware, it prompts for admin rights. Most of you TFTS guys are probably already saying ""aaah I know what that is.""

My manager taps me and one of the other top guns on the team to look at it, and I get my user in at around 1000 to start hammering her laptop. And oh boy, do I hammer it. I look at everything I think could be an issue. The windows developers give me a whole new version of the program to install for her. I verify it's an issue with her laptop (She can access the program just fine from another machine) and that something is fucky with the UAC on the machine. 

Three hours of troubleshooting later, including turning down my user's offer to wait while I went to lunch, I bring in one of my support guys. He's a brilliant chap, a quite literal autist who is ridiculously overqualified for his current level of work and knows more about computers than 90% of the folks in my org. He loves interesting problems and sinking his teeth into them. I'm on the horn with the guy when I say ""it's GOTTA be a compatibility issue on the laptop, we ran it just fine on something else.""

As I lit the spotlight to call down CAPTAIN OBVIOUS to the table, he right clicked the program, opened up compatibility, and said... ""Oh you're right. It's set to ask for admin rights every time.""

... All my whats. All my fucking whats. Three hours and it was a fucking checkbox that for some godawful reason ticked despite a standardized install. While the user was happy, I still want to bash my head into a wall for spending three hours for MISSING THE OBVIOUS. 

(Tale 2) On the off chance I'm wrong and this isn't normal for troubleshooting....

So we were working as normal when suddenly tickets for profiles started to come in. No access to personal profiles, no personal files, etc. Within a few minutes, I realized it was all coming from a specific server- If there is one thing I know I am good at it is troubleshooting and recognizing commonality of errors. So I rang the bell and yelled up the chain, and sure enough, everyone on this specific server was not able to get into their profile.

Mind you, this server hosted the *executives*, the bigwigs of my agency- as in, the Agency Head, and all the Chief Top Brass Sons of Bitches who were yelling down the phone as to why they were not able to get into their files.

An investigation by the top-line engineering team found some programs running on the server that were destroying the CPU usage and they rebooted it and fixed it... but profiles still were missing. After a half hour and god knows how much yelling, I decided to peek into the server. I'm still a line doggie, so I didn't know how much I could do. But when I logged in and looked at the server, I was greeted by none other than a server that had no user profiles on it. At all.

So I cautiously emailed the Engineering team (I assume everyone knows more than I do, which is the case often enough where I phrase everything carefully- My background is electronics maintenance, not IT) and said ""Hey, so... I assume this is part of troubleshooting work on your end, but the server is missing the user profiles folder- just wanted to say so in case that is not normal.""

Queue the Engineering Manager patting me on the head for seeing the obvious. He restored the folder, and the day was saved. 

Sometimes, you miss the obvious. Sometimes, you point it out.

2076,That's not how this works. Bridges must be burned first.,"Back in the early 2000's I had a client that I did IT work for. Network setup, cable runs, printers and lots of software troubleshooting. At first I was hesitant to take them on since the owner was an estranged relative and giant red flags were already flying. You see unfortunately Owner had a reputation of having Lawyer on retainer and Owner kept him busy. Owner thought that scare tactics like litigation was a great way to handle anything he wanted. Owner was even known to have gone after his own children. So yea, Owner was a real peach so keeping him at arms reach was a requirement.

Me – Me

Owner – Estranged family member and all around peach.

New Guy – What ever IT person is in place

Lawyer – His lawyer of many years

So one day Owner tells me he wants a website for the company. Early on I did single page websites with just information so I could easily prepare a basic site. During this process I found out that a new salesman Owner hired dropped the idea in his ear and already had fliers and business cards printed up with the new website. One problem, Owner didn't own the domain name printed on the cards and fliers. This escalated when I found out that his Competitor actually purchased the domain name and created a website all about Competitors company. Lawyer is then invoked and using my imagination I hear legalese loudly shouted back and forth with Owner demanding that it belonged to him. I even consulted with Owner and Lawyer at this point informing them that Competitor bought the domain name first and Competitor can do what they want with it. Most of all there is a process of transferring domain names for security purposes and even if they win any lawsuit or Competitor gives it up, that transfer process still has to occur. 

In the end Owner didn't get the domain, but Competitor did take down the site. So I purchased a domain name that was very similar to the one Owner couldn't have and hosted his basic site. Over the years I did some updates to the site like staff changes (Including the fired sales person.), pictures and services. Things were quiet. I should mention that I purchased the domain name under my umbrella and hosted the site on my server. It was small and there was little to no traffic going to it, so my older web server could handle it. So IT work continues onsite for another year or two when suddenly my last two invoices are not paid. Inquiries made, but no word on what's going on. Then I get a letter in the mail from Owner and that my ""services were no longer needed"" and they wouldn't pay those invoices.

I wasn't really upset about this result. It felt more of dodging a bullet. Plus him not paying for work came as no surprise either. After a week or two I get a phone call.

New Guy – ""Hey this is New Guy. I'm taking care of IT for Owner Company. They told me to call you and get the passwords to the network WiFi, File Server and Admin Accounts."" 

Me - ""Oh really? Did they also mention that they have two open invoices and have officially refused to pay both?""

New Guy – ""No""

Me – ""I see. No surprise. Anyway all settings, configurations and other stuff are in an Admin Folder on the File Server.""

New Guy – ""What's the password?"" 

Me – "" Sorry, I can't help you. That bridge has been burned.""

Silence

Me - ""Oh there's a copy of their website on the File Server also. Once you start the transfer process with your domain provider you can request the domain name and I'll transfer it to you.""

New Guy – ""What?""

Me – ""Their website domain needs to be transferred and site host changed from mine to yours. Check with your provider about transferring domain name BlahBlah.net to you so we can start the process.""

New Guy – ""What website?"" 

Me – ""Oh boy. Well good luck and watch your back. C.Y.A. and document everything for the next guy.""

End call.

Never heard from him, so after about month I shutdown the site. Later on I renewed the domain name since I had a gut feeling. On a side note I also noticed that the original domain name Owner wanted was available. I thought about grabbing it but left it alone. Not my monkey, not my circus.

Fast forward about two years and the domain is up for renewal once again, which I cover, but decide to see if anyone was paying attention. So I created a simple page that said ""This domain name is for sale"" and to contact me via such and such email. Weeks later I get a message from a person via an unrelated work email. 

Unknown Person: “How much for the website? “

Hmm, interesting. 

Me – ""Selling it since it's costing me money and the client never requested a transfer. You may contact me at *work number* for more details."" 

No price given.

Next day I get a call from his lawyer.

Lawyer- ""My name is Lawyer representing Owner. You can't sell his website, he owns it. You need to give it to him.""

Me – ""I know who you are. That's not how this works.""  

Lawyer – ""You can't sell something that doesn't belong to you.""

Me – ""You didn't learn anything from the previous litigation you were involved with Owner and Competitor. I told you in great detail how this works.""

His tone suddenly changes.

Lawyer – ""You're the same person?""

Me – ""Yep and New Guy contacted me a long time ago but never started a transfer request for the domain name. I also had to explain the process to New Guy, just like with you and Owner years ago. Oh and by the way Owner has a full copy of the website on the server. Hopefully someone didn't delete it.""

Lawyer - ""Okay well go ahead and transfer the website over to Owner then.""

Here we go. Invoke lawyer speak.

Me - ""This is a two party process. The first party: Owner Company. Must request the domain name to be transferred online via Owners domain name provider, like say GoDaddy. That request reaches me via my provider and the process begins. I'm the second party. It's a bit technical but required for domain names to change hands. It's for security purposes so folks don't grab up someones domain name and use it like Competitor did. Once the transfer is complete, the website files can be moved to a new host.""

Lawyer – ""Okay so Owner just has to make the request and it goes to him?"" 

Me – ""It's a bit more complicated than that, but if current New Guy is available they can contact me and we can work out the details. The process just needs a starting point.""

Lawyer – ""Okay I'll let them know.""

Me – ""And just to let you know, a couple of years ago Owner decided not to pay for services rendered that I had to write off. While I'm not letting that factor into this situation you can let him know that is a bridge he burned."" 

Lawyer – ""What?""

Pause

Lawyer – ""Okay I'll get in contact with them today.""

Nothing happened afterwards. No request, emails, phone calls, nothing. Once the renewal came up again, I just let it expire. The family member that talked me into taking him on years ago retired soon after due to Owners behavior. Company passed to new management after Owner passed away and still exists today. They now have a nice little WordPress site on a new domain name.

2077,Why is the WiFi beeping?,"Wait what?  
Anyways, I remembered a tale from a time past at the Complicated Computering Complex^(TM)

For background ^(radiation,) this company has a nuclear materials lab for training, testing, evaluation, experiments, etc. 

Cast &amp; Crew:  
Radioactive Lady - Makes a confusing request, was not glowing  
$Steve - FNG that sleeps on the job now   
$Me - Maverick go-getter   

It's a slow day in the office, I'm reading up on the latest security threats, being responsible with VMware resources, wondering what new madness will befall upon us, the usual, etc. 

Ding! A ticket!

$RL - Why is the wifi beeping?   
It's rather annoying in the last training group we had..  
$Me - Wot?   
I had recently learned about coil whine, but these AP's are built to the most rigorous of industrial standards (Cisco) and after deploying 200 of them, they don't beep. 

Let's go have a look Steve! 

So we roll up in the fledermaus-mobile (oversized black golf-cart) and find out her lab is much harder to locate than previously thought. 

The important missing detail was going left past the snake pit and Steve nearly got bitten again

Anyways, we found it and $RL meets us and opens up the lab and BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE

Being that my hearing is similar to that of a bat/dog, I am inundated with the high pitched screech of some instrument that is definitely not an AP. 

What's that thing?  
\*points to a shrieking yellow box\*

$RL - Oh, that's our other geiger counter and ope! it has a dead battery!  
\*click\*   
Silence deafens the room

Steve asks what samples they had on hand (I don't know why) 

After looking at him sideways after that question and then closing up the lab, we did see that the room acoustics of the lab + material storage &amp; coat closet had the noise bouncing around which did sound like it was coming from above. 

So the concern for the newly minted NRRT (networking radioactive response team) was valid, but  the AP was outside the closet and visibly not beeping.",1,1630602916
2078,Yet another FNG story,"I've been inspired the recent posts featuring FNGs, so here's yet another one.

Long ago I worked for a company that sold mini computers to various types of clients.  One application was sold to financial institutions and we had a proof of concept system installed at on very large such institution in a different city from our office, basically an hour plane ride plus maybe 30 minutes to drive from the airport to the customer.

We had been supporting this site remotely but we finally got some additional business in the area and were able to hire $FNG.   I was not involved in hiring $FNG but I found him super personable and seemed pretty sharp.  We sent him to our home office for a standard 2 week training course and then he was ready to go.  

One day the test system (the proof of concept system) went down and $FNG headed over.   He worked on it most of the day with numerous calls to our lead support guy in our office.  By the end of the day he was no further along so my boss told me to fly up the next morning.  $FNG had a set of spare parts so I didn't have to bring anything.

Next day I fly up, rent a car, and head to the site, $FNG meets me there.  We check in with the customer and start troubleshooting.  $FNG fills me in with great detail about all the things he did to troubleshoot, it sounds good but I'm a bit uneasy as it sounds like he really got a bit casual with swapping out parts.

The layout on theses minicomputers was three separate chassis, each one with various PCBs plugged into a backplane.  There were also some cables that connected some of the PCBs to each other and to outside devices.  Some of the PCBs were almost identical so it wasn't unknown to get some of the swapped with each other, but $FNG had assured our support guy that he had verified he had things correctly populated.  

I looked over the system and everything seemed correct at first glance.  I decided I would have to troubleshoot from step one, even though $FNG assured me that he had already performed the basic steps.  First thing I decided to do was simply re-seat all the PCBs since experience had shown that once in a while this was an easy fix.

I started from the top left chassis and popped the first PCB out, slid it back in, and stopped.  I did a double take and peered at the PCB.  It was one of the similar types and belonged in a different slot.  Quickly glanced thought all the PCBs, sure enough, several were in the wrong slot, clearly this was NOT the way the system had been configured before $FNG showed up.   

I quietly showed $FNG what was wrong and suggested we work through getting the PCBs back into their correct slots, which we did.  At one point our customer contact came by to check in, $FNG went into a total blast of technobabble, but delivered it in a completely believable manner.  I was crouched over the system listening in amazement, this guy could sell shoes to snakes.  

It took a short time to get the system back to the correct configuration and then we could actually diagnose the problem, which took another hour, I think.  $FNG was very appreciative, thanked me repeatedly, all was good.  

The next day I was back in the office and my boss and tech support guy reviewed the problem and how things had gone.   $FNG was a new guy so our expectation on his first system problem were not that great.  I was concerned that he had clearly messed things up worse than the original problem, and he had not been able to recognize it even with someone on the phone walking him through step by step.  My boss (who had hired him) was a bit shaken since he prided himself on doing great job interviews, but we decided to wait and see.

$FNG was around for a while and we had a few other cases of overlooking simple items, but he limped along, using his great people skills (he really did have a great people skills) to get by.   Eventually he left the company and went into sales, where I bet he was fantastic.",1,1630602045
2079,Where is the laptop,"  Some background - I use to work help desk support remotely for a big pizza company when I was in college. Really it just required me to be on the phone all day and do basic trouble shooting.

One day the phone rings and I pick up. 

A user was asking for the password to a laptop my company gives out to all their employees. I told the user the password should be their email password. They replied back that it wasn't their laptop it was one of their student's and they found the phone number under the computer. 

My follow up question was where the student in question was. In my mind I thought maybe the company recycles old laptops or sold them off. The teacher responded that the student was in a school district located 10 states away from the company. I asked them to read me off the serial number on the back of the laptop so I could report it to my supervisor and see if it was still active.

There have been a few cases within the company of computers being stolen from company employees - and if this was the case, we needed to lock the computer ASAP. I kept the teacher on the phone and thanked them for their patience and I pinged my supervisor. My supervisor was able to pull a name that the laptop was assigned to and noted the laptop was still active. 

I wrote down the teacher's phone number and name and noted I would have to call them back. This was done because Teams and the phone software we use works horribly together. I hung up the phone and called the owner of the company laptop on Teams. 

I asked two basic questions: 'Do you know where your laptop is, and do you have a child who goes to xxx school' 

Their response was a mixture of laugher and relief, stating that the child's father mixed up the laptops and that they would have to call the teacher now. I told my supervisor the computer was not stolen and that ended there.",1,1630598788

2081,In Which the FNG Manufactures the Very Rope With Which to Hang Himself,"Shameless as I am, I will be jumping on this FNG bandwagon. This is a story from way back in the day; as usual, *everything* has been changed to protect the innocent--the guilty get a free ride on their behalf.

----

$Company is in the middle of an unexpected growth spurt and everyone is playing catch-up. In addition, we have closed a lease on a nearby property that will allow the corporate folks to move out of the retail space. In a rare case of forethought, the suits decide to bring on some of the new hire technical trainers early so that they can lend a hand with the expansion and move. One of these hires has rack-and-stack / structured cabling experience along with several IT certifications, and so is given the task of setting up a new training room.

The details of these plans are made without my involvement, I'm just aware that people will be starting early to help with the build-out.

So $FNG, along with a few other trainers, arrive on their first day and are introduced. $FNG and I hit it off especially well as we have some shared experience to bond over and he's generally an easy-going, personable guy. Over the next few days, we spend a few minutes bullshitting when we meet each other in the halls, generally doing that new-coworker-friend dance.

In the middle of $FNG's second week, he stops by my desk and asks for some help:

&gt; **$FNG**: Hey, $Me, can you give me a hand setting up this training room? It's kind of a last-minute thing and I'm not sure I'll have enough time to get it done.

&gt; **$Me**: [laughing] Isn't that just the $company way--months of planning this move and no one thinks to plan the network side! Let me finish up a few things here and I'll meet you in the room.

&gt; **$FNG**: Awesome, thanks!

Most of my important work is all waiting on other people at the moment, so I can actually spare a half-day or so without any real consequences. We're also still a pretty small company at that point and we're all used to doing the odd-job or banding together on projects. About an hour later, I walk over to see what's still left to do:

&gt; **$Me**: Hey, $FNG, I figured we could get an idea of what's left and then do some planning over lunch, this afternoon we can come back and crush...

&gt; **$Me**: What are all these boxes?

&gt; **$FNG**: Those are the workstations.

&gt; **$Me**: ...and these?

&gt; **$FNG**: those are keyboards and mice, and the switch is over here, and this box has all the network cables.

&gt; **$Me**: So in the hour since you've talked to me you have...

&gt; **$FNG**: I organized all the boxes.

&gt; **$Me**: Ok... How many workstations?

&gt; **$FNG**: I don't know... [counts boxes] looks like 30 towers.

&gt; **$Me**: And when does this need to be done by?

&gt; **$FNG**: They want to do a trial run tomorrow.

&gt; **$Me**: Tomorrow! You got one day for this?

&gt; **$FNG**: Yeah.

&gt; **$Me**: Well... I guess we should get started. You start unboxing workstations, 30 towers on five rows of two tables is three per table, got it? I'll unbox the peripherals and set them out.

We get to work. Honestly, it's not really all that much work, even for one guy and half a day, but I know how these things can go wrong in a hurry. Sure enough, while someone ordered workstation patch cables, they were all 3'--not nearly long enough for 2/3 of the workstations to reach the ports on the walls. $CTO says he will take care of it and we'll have cables in the morning.

Meanwhile, we knock out the rest of the work, chatting about certifications while we do. He went to a technical school that encouraged certification while I was self-taught at the time. We get the room finished up early the next morning and the trainers are happy despite the delay.

----

At the time my desk was in a bullpen-style area at the end of a hall that contained a mini-bar we used for coffee and employee snacks. The way the hall and the room intersected caused two things:

* People frequently socialized with those in the room while stopping by to make coffee or get a drink. The bar was inset just a little, so if you leaned against the counter just outside the room you weren't blocking the hallway but were still within earshot of everyone in the room.

* From the mini bar, you could see almost all of the room--almost all, except for the near corners where two desks were located. Veteran employees were in the habit of poking their head in when arriving to see if those desks were occupied--a frequent joke was how someone would ask if we knew where $A was, while $A was sitting just out of sight--but the new hires hadn't learned this trick yet.

So a few days later, $FNG stops by to thank me.

&gt; **$FNG**: Hey, $Me, I just wanted to thank you for your help last week.

&gt; **$Me**: No problem, we're a pretty laid-back group here; happy to help out when needed. Glad we were able to get it done that quickly, even with the cable issue.

&gt; **$FNG**: Yeah, I couldn't have done it without your help.

&gt; **$Me**: Again, no worries.

&gt; **$FNG**: Also, I wanted to tell you that I'm thinking of studying for my CCNA, maybe we'll work together in the future.

&gt; **$Me**: Well, I'm sure we'll work together regardless in the near future, but that's good to hear. You'll have to tell me how it goes.

$FNG heads back with his $Era-Equivalent-Monster-Drink to whatever he was doing. Unbeknownst to him, $CTO had been sitting at exactly one of those hidden desks working with another employee and had heard the entire exchange. After $FNG leaves, $CTO wheels his chair over next to mine and starts an enlightening conversation:

&gt; **$CTO**: You helped $FNG set up the training room?

&gt; **$Me**: Yeah... remember when I came to you about the cables?

&gt; **$CTO**: Sure, but I thought $FNG just asked you about the issue and you came to me--not that you were helping with the actual setup. When did he ask you for help?

&gt; **$Me**: $Date mid-morning. We knocked most of it out that afternoon.

&gt; **$CTO**: And how do you like $FNG, think he'll work out?

&gt; **$Me**: He's a nice enough person. We won't be at each other's weddings, but we might get a few beers sometime. Little rusty on the hardware side, but I guess he's a trainer, not a tech.

&gt; **$CTO**: Yes... good to know. Excuse me, I have to take care of something.

&gt; **$Me**: Ciao!

I knew something was up but didn't get the whole story until a day or so later.

Turns out, $FNG had that entire week to get the room set up. Or rather, his only two tasks were to review the training material he'd been teaching, and set up the room--and only the room had a hard deadline. So he had seemingly wasted the first three days and had to enlist help when only a few hours were left before the deadline. That was concerning, but the kicker was that $FNG had not only ""CCNA"" proudly listed on his resume, but ""CCNP--active"" as well (which, at the time, was a certification you could not get without having passed the CCNA).

So $FNG had unknowingly, not only confessed to bad time management in front of his ultimate supervisor, but he had also confessed to not having a certification he claimed to possess in front of the very person who interviewed him. $CFO called $FNG into his office that afternoon and asked him to provide proof of his certifications. At that point, $FNG knew the jig was up and confessed everything. Turns out, most of his resume--all of the technical experience--was forged. He was let go immediately.

Ironically, we were a pretty laid-back team at the time, and none of those certifications or experience were essential qualifications for the job. While he would have been a less attractive candidate with an honest resume, there would still have been a reasonable chance of landing the job.",1,1630592071
2082,"My first day at new company, I made a good impression!","
A bit of background here. I have worked in support/maintenance roles my entire working life, I don't do management so have been happy not to get promoted. Hence I was probably a good ten years older than my work colleagues. But this has advantages. I fix rather than replace, I know how to use a soldering iron! Anyway, back to the story.

It was my first day and my new boss was showing me round the building and introducing me. We went into the server room and three of my new colleagues are standing in front of a screen scratching their heads. There is an error message on the screen:
KEYBOARD NOT FOUND PRESS ANY KEY TO CONTINUE
The keyboard is definitely plugged in.
They tried a different keyboard, no change.
They were talking about having to buy a new motherboard and this was an expensive piece of kit, board several hundred pounds at least.

I immediately had an idea as to what might be wrong, so I asked if I could take it to their well equipped workshop and take a look. The guys were quite surprised but agreed anyway as they had nothing to lose.

I took to to the workshop and got the lid off, had a look inside. Sure enough there was a tiny ceramic fuse right next to the keyboard socket. I had read in a computer magazine only a few days previously that these can blow if you hot plug or unplug the keyboard. I soldered a small wire bridge across the fuse and hey presto! Server working again. I took it back in triumph to gasps of amazement from everybody.

 I explained what I had done (without mentioning I had read it in a magazine of course) and told than not to hot plug keyboards. So, immediate God status from whole IT department (and more importantly my new manager, especially as I had saved him the cost of a new motherboard!)",1,1630592007
2083,You may have a law degree but you're still an idiot. || Part 1,"Before we start, some context. I work as a SysAdmin for a medium sized law firm. (Read: I'm the only IT person for a law firm of about 100~ people) As such I handle *basically* every issue for pretty much anything that plugs into a wall. I wear every hat from Tier 1 Help Desk to CTO most days.

To set the stage for the type of environment this is, and the type of people I support. The law firm was founded by a single lawyer in the mid 80s, and eventually grew to be one of the largest (for our specific type of law) in our state. But the entire operation is still running in exceptionally legacy software (think like, it was written in 1992 and hasn't been updated since) the company that wrote it was acquired by another company in 1995 which was acquired by another, and another, and so on, I think we're 4 or 5 companies at the current point in time. Contacting their support and trying to get anything fixed other than surface level settings is an exercise in futility. 

Also the previous firm founder passed away and the firm was sold to a different set of lawyers that owned their own firm. As such these new owners are coming in, investing a ton of money to modernize all the IT systems (thank god), but as a result we're in the middle of 6, possibly 7 different migrations including our main ERP and CRMs, our phone system, fax system, and email. (Relevant later)

I have dozens of stories like this (as well as more involved ones) to share after some time working here that is finally coming to an end later this year. And that I hope to be able to find time to share all of them in the coming weeks.

What about the type of people I support that I mentioned above but didn't elaborate on? I'm glad you asked, that's where this story starts. You see, lawyers are second only to doctors in attitude and entitlement (most days, and to be fair, not all of them, most of them are incredibly nice people, but alas, those ones do not make for the good storytelling). Most of them have what I call a ""learned helplessness."" 

This story starts by one of our attorneys, lets call him Richard, commanding one of his paralegal assistants, to come find me. Now, it should be known that I work remotely more than I'm actually in office (I work a hybrid schedule right now, 3 out, 2 in, leaving for full remote at the end of the year bless up). As such, users do not typically just walk up to me/my office for issues. They will call my extension, email me, or call my cell phone. 

Anyways, she appears at my door, quietly knocks and informs me that Richard has told her to tell me that I ""urgently need to fix his printer as his printer has disappeared entirely from Windows and he needs to print this demand for X client where our fee is going to be Y amount and this is costing us money."" You guys know the self indulgent spiel that users with an inflated sense of self tend to give.

So of course, I drop everything I'm currently doing (remember those migrations), and walk over to his office. First thing I do is open the Printers and Scanners panel in Windows, not do all 3 of our managed MFPs show up, but his desk printer does too. And right next to the label that says ""RICHARD'S DESK PRINTER"" is another little label. This one however says something different, it says ""Offline"".

I notice this and look to my right at the physical printer. I notice there's no LED lit up on the power button. I press the power button, the printer instantly whirrs to life and starts spitting out whatever he tried to print 2 minutes ago. 

I proceed to not say anything and walk out of his office.


And that is why, just because you have a law degree, doesn't mean you're not an idiot.",1,1630591693

2085,"FNG finally gets fired, but goes out in the worst way he could have","Been lurking here for a few years, and while this story isn't really tech-support or anything like that, u/iammandalore's stories of his FNG made me want to post about the new guy we just recently lost due to him being inept, lazy, and/or just didn't care. Probably not the most entertaining story, but how could someone be this stupid?

Background: I work for an IT contracting company, and the contract I'm on is as a Service Desk tech at a hospital. My boss works for the same company I do, and he reports to the hospital's CIO. 

After some schedule changes, somebody quit, more schedule changes, and new people were hired and trained. I got moved into M-F 2nd shift after having been on M-F 2nd shift then 3rd shift on weekends. This is about the guy who took the shitty hybrid schedule I just left. Well, mostly about the event that caused him to be fired. 

Prior to this final event, he rarely responded to any communication directed at him regardless of importance. There was one night we were working together where I had to go off-site to image some computers, and hadn't heard a word from him all shift. He wasn't answering calls, texts, messages in Webex, nothing. It took multiple calls from bosses to get him to acknowledge anything.

When I did see him in person, he barely spoke a word to me unless he was on a call and needed help, which he needed. Frequently. Myself and other coworkers have had to coach him through some of the simplest things we do multiple times. He also regularly neglected the very few tasks he had on those night shifts, and I've gotten too many calls from users who were speaking with him and said that the call dropped suspiciously while he was working with them. Toward the end he seemed to be getting better, but man was he not at all. We all knew he was going to be fired at some point, but were just waiting for the when and why.

&amp;#x200B;

This is the when and why that I've been told from my boss and a coworker.

I heard this from my boss after I got up Monday morning, and this happened around midnight on Sunday night, during my now-former coworker's night shift. Found out later from another coworker that it was about an hour into his shift, as she was called in to take over at around 1AM.

According to my boss, the ~~dude~~ idiot was sleeping on a couch, wrapped up in a blanket with his shoes off and his laptop on his stomach. He didn't even go somewhere to try and hide, just in plain sight in a doctor's lounge where anyone could have found him.

And he was found. By a security guard and the on-duty nurse supervisor.

When they confronted him, he got argumentative to the point where they had to call the police to escort him out of the building. Security took his badge, and then he had the testicular fortitude to sneak back in. When he was found again, they had to have the police escort him out a second time, and he was drunk. He might have been drunk the whole time, but I'm putting this together from multiple sources so who knows. That series of events over the course of an hour or so was the final straw, after many of his fuck ups. It wasn't my boss who fired him either. It was the hospital's CIO. At around 1AM on a Monday morning.

Funny thing is that apparently when he was interviewed for the position, he did very well. In practice though, he was barely good enough to just answer phone calls. Found out after his first few fuck-ups that he was going through some really rough life stuff, causing me to think ""why the hell would you do this when you need the job?""

Whatever the reason, good riddance and thanks for the overtime.

TLDR; now-former coworker already on his last chance gets drunk and argumentative to Security when caught sleeping, gets kicked out of the building twice, then fired by the CIO.",1,1630553043

2090,Apparently projectors have a freeze button,"I don’t know if I deserve to post here,I don’t work tech support, I’m just a computer science major, that wants to learn more about computers and stuff so I try to help where I can, I also recently rebirthed an old computer (of mine) with Linux, I’m not great at this stuff, but hey the way to improve is practice

So the projector was frozen on the first side of a power point

I start by assuming the projector is a second monitors, I’ve had minor issues with a second monitor on the past, turns out the projector has the same signal, so they are both the same monitor, kind of like how two keyboards are treated

I then tried to check the physical connections, and I thought I found the issue, there was a big wire that just wasn’t plugged in, I tried to figure out what it was, and asked the professor eventually (couldn’t at first, she was talking to the class while I was fixing it) as it turns out she has never seen that wire before, so I looked around, I then noticed it was plugged into something with a tag that says “laptop” which has a switch turned to “desktop” and a desktop is plugged in

Turns out that’s incase you want a laptop to be plugged in, but you don’t have to unplug the main computer (teachers often teach in different rooms, so maybe it’s so they can avoid messing with a cool-workers set up)

So I decided to check the projector settings, grab the remote, and then just start cracking up
Right below the main controls, I’m an easy place to accidentally press there’s a big button that says “freeze”

I press it, and suddenly it works

I just continue laughing, and just show three teacher/class that there was a freeze button, one or two laugh a small amount,I was probably the only person am really found it funny (I was also the only one who spent 30 minutes on the problem)

2093,I check my voicemail all the time,"So, the company I work for was bought by another company back in May.  After that, new company announced that the company would be renamed “new company name”.  This started with and O365 tenant to tenant migration, a change in primary email addresses, and an update to the corporate signature, all of which IT (me) completed with almost no issues.  Today, 3 months later, the new leadership team sent an email out to remind users to update their voicemail greetings to reflect the new company name.  This process is documented and honestly quite easy, but we learned the following today.

-30 users voicemail boxes were locked out for over two years, they never bothered to tell us to unlock it, and they didn’t have voicemail to email, so they just haven’t checked their voicemails in two years.  One of those is the main line voicemail.  It had not been checked since 2016.

-5 people swear they never have had voicemail.  News flash, they have…for 10 years

-10 people told me they had special voicemail that didn’t have a pin code, it recognized their voice.  We don’t have that feature.  We just have a shitty Mitel system that requires a pin.  Nothing fancy.

-3 people wanted me to record their greeting.  I said if I did that, I would mention they work for either a brothal or boy band, and I refused to change it after.  They complained to my boss, it was worth the finger wag from my boss to hear her say you can’t tell employees they work for a boy band.

-5 people never had a voicemail greeting

-10 people had the previous persons greeting, even when they themselves had been here over a year

-1 person told me his phone number routed to another company’s phone system.  It didn’t, it was the recording of previous person.

-2 people wanted to know if could edit their voicemail greetings to eliminate the background noise.  I explained I have two small kids and walked outside to do mine, as it takes 2 minutes and is less loud.  That was not acceptable.

I come by once a week to do laundry and hang out with my grandmother and tonight was that night. My grandmother’s boyfriend, Hank, calls me into the other room where it’s *super* warm, like I’m sweating in seconds of walking in, to ask me for tech support tonight.

&gt;Hank: Can you check out the TV? Like reboot it or something? Channel 2 CBS is always going mute randomly and now it’s spreading to other rooms.

I agree rebooting sounds like a good start so I unplug all of the fairly hot cable boxes around the house and leave them unplugged for a good 30 or so minutes while I talk with my grandmother.

I come back and plug in everything and they get to watching all these awful shows like Young Sheldon and whatever else was on while I browse Reddit and play mobile games. But I peek my head up every so often and start to notice what Hank was talking about. Randomly throughout commercial breaks, mostly, the sound just goes dead silent. Pretty wonderful to me, but I could understand this was *their* entertainment.

Then I started noticing that throughout all of these shows…there was this really weird narration. I thought it was a strange move by CBS to have so many shows from comedy to drama have this woman in the background describing what’s going on in each episode. Maybe their new trademark?

Then I started picking up on it during NCIS when it was clearly out of place and realize this is definitely not CBS’ doing.

I asked Hank for the remote and checked the Accessibility settings and saw someone enabled some setting for narration that was only showing on CBS, not on any other channel we were watching. Disabled that setting and so far over the last few hours, all is good again.

This isn’t uncommon at my grandmother’s house. Someone is always enabling some weird setting on the TV and everyone just puts up with it until I come around.",1,1630388043

2097,A case of impeccable timing,"I'm a full stack web dev, mostly working on developing and maintaining eCommerce sites using my company's in-house platform. We do support and maintenance as well as new sites and features, but aren't expected to support end users directly. However we occasionally (or in the case of the site that features in this story, not so rarely) get end user issues forwarded to us if the client's helpdesk can't fix it.

This particular site is healthcare-adjacent. I'm not in the US so HIPAA doesn't apply but data security is still a particularly big deal for this site compared to some of our other clients - and security of customer data is a big deal for everyone these days.

In the far-off days before the pandemic, I'd been working for months on a Major New Feature that allowed customers to use the site in a different way than before. It touched almost every part of the site and presented some fairly unique problems. We had to request a new feature be added to the in-house platform just for this, which necessitated deferring its completion until after a separate project to the site through a major version of the platform.

Finally, everything is completed, tested, and signed off. The big release goes fairly smoothly, the Major New Feature and we pat ourselves on the back and relax.

*Cut to shortly after we get in the following morning*

A customer who placed a single order is receiving dozens, no, hundreds of order confirmation emails. He provides a screenshot of his flooded inbox.

Virtually all eCommerce sites have transactional emails - and this has more than many, along with optional text message notifications. One of the implications of the Major New Feature is that it's no longer completely trivial to decide who should be notified by what method about updates to a given order or account. I've written a nice new piece of code that abstracts away all this decision making into one place.

Obviously, I've got something terribly wrong. Are we sending every email update to the same person, this guy? Worse\*, are we sending every update to *everyone*, and this guy is just the first to report it? Either way, it sounds like a significant data security breach, on the site that I would least like to have a data breach on, that's definitely my fault. It's **panic stations**.

I start looking frantically at my new code and the database, while our senior dev gets into the logs. I've just found the mildly reassuring information that the number of emails the customer appears to have received doesn't match up with orders taken since the release of the Major New Feature, when the senior reports that the order confirmation page for this customer's single order is being requested ten times a minute.

He's refreshing the page ten times a minute. For an hour. We assume that it's some kind of browser extension or something.

A quick proof of concept confirms that you can indeed generate multiple confirmation emails by refreshing that page. Which I hasten to add is not ok, and we immediately put a ticket in to fix it. But this bug appears to have been in the site for years. *Of all the days for it to come to light...*

&amp;#x200B;

\*Actually, that probably wouldn't be *much* worse, because at that time we had another issue in the system that would have caused nearly all emails to fail to send in that case.",1,1630351872

2099,New User Nightmare,"Hello all, it has been some time since my last post on here. Since that last post I have left the service desk job that I had and thought my time at the help desk was over. However much like an ex texting you at 3 in the morning, you can't help but get pulled back in.

This particular day was my first real day out of training, and it should've been a fairly easy day being a Friday and all. However, the IT gods above did not seem to want to give me an easy day. Thus began a multiple call saga, that spilt over into today. So sit back, relax, and enjoy my suffering.

The characters in this story are:

Me: Your storyteller for the moment, and the hero of this anime.

New User: My eternal rival, and the best/worst part of my day.

As our story begins I am just logging in for the day, and within a minute or so I get a call.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Me: Hello, thank you for contacting the \[insert company name here\] service desk, I'm Eon can I have your username?  
&gt;  
&gt;New User: \**provides username*\*  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: Wonderful, how can I help you?  
&gt;  
&gt;New User: Hi, I'm new user and I'm trying to setup my computer but I'm stuck.  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: Yeah no problem, what step are you stuck on?  
&gt;  
&gt;New User: On step 3.

Now before we go any further I should explain something. When a user is sent a computer we send them a fairly in depth list of instructions on setting up their device. These instructions are, in my opinion, very easy to follow with one or two issues that most users have. They are so easy in fact that the only thing that would make them easier is if they included pictures. With that little info dump out of the way lets continue.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Me: Okay, step 3 should have you reset your password. There should be a website listed on that step as well. Do you see it?  
&gt;  
&gt;New User: There isn't any website listed.  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: Sir I can assure you there is a website listed there  
&gt;  
&gt;New User: No website, just this \[insert web address here\] at the end of the step.  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: \**trying to stop my palm from colliding with my forehead*\* That's the website sir...  
&gt;  
&gt;New User: No it's not.  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: Type that into a web browser and it will take you to the website sir...  
&gt;  
&gt;New User: Why didn't it say that?  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: \**internally ""I shouldn't have to say it""*\* It just assumes that users would know what to do in that circumstance.  
&gt;  
&gt;New User: Yeah, well I don't mess with computers none.  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: Most of our new users don't sir.

From this point the call goes on and I get his password reset and in the instructions it says that an initial password reset can take at least 30 minutes so the user says he'll call back in 30 minutes to continue setup.

**15 minutes later...**

I receive another call from who else but New User.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Me: Hello, thank you for contacting the \[insert company name here\] service desk, I'm Eon can I have your username?  
&gt;  
&gt;New User: \**provides username*\* Yeah I just got off the phone 30 minutes ago and am ready to go through the setup some more.  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: Yes sir, it was me you spoke with and based on the time it has not yet been 30 minutes, I recommend calling back in another 15 minutes.  
&gt;  
&gt;New User: Alright

The call gets disconnected and this would be another good time to provide some information. The reason I didn't continue to help is because the ""at least 30 minutes"" isn't an exaggeration, 30 minutes is the quickest that the password will synchronize for first time users in our system. Not sure why though, but that's just how it is.

Back to the story again though.

**15 more minutes later...**

Of course the guy calls in again, and at this point I just recognize the number.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Me: Hello, thank you for contacting the \[insert company name here\] service desk, is this \[insert users name\]?  
&gt;  
&gt;New User: Yes this is him.  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: Yes I've been the same agent you've spoken to every time you've called this morning. How can I help you this time?

The user then proceeds to basically tell me his life story, culminating in a summary of his issue. A very incorrect summary mind you, but still a summary nonetheless. I work with him for the next **45 MINUTES!!** On something that the users are expected to do by themselves mind you. Getting a number of questions that would be answered if the guy actually read the instructions that were given to him. I finally manage to talk him into working through it himself, and he agrees stating that he'll call back if he has any other issues. I end the call and pray to any god that will listen that I don't have to deal with him again. 

Later that day he does callback, and is very promptly taken care of by a coworker.

I was hoping this would be the end of my interactions with him, at least until some point far down the line... Today has unfortunately rained on that parade.

I'm just going to give you the cliff notes of this call, as I don't want to transpose it. He called back in because only the default password was letting him sign into his computer, the new password he created wasn't working. His new password would work when in the computer however, this was caused by him not locking and unlocking his computer while on VPN. This was odd to me, since, you guessed it, a step in the setup for the computer! When I mentioned this he of course got defensive because, and I quote ""I followed them steps on the paper"". Luckily the call didn't last that long and I, hopefully, won't have to deal with this guy for a nice loooooong while.

I hope you all enjoyed my little story.",1,1630336542
2100,Never forget to check the basics,"I work for a company that provides a cloud communications platform as a service — developers can use our web service APIs to do a lot of neato stuff. I’m a tier 3 technical support engineer/developer — usually when a ticket makes it to our queue, advanced troubleshooting is needed. 

I suppose that’s how sometimes the team forgets to check off the basics of troubleshooting, and something like this goes over our heads. 

Got a user who couldn’t get our programmable chat API to work. By the time I got the ticket, two of my team members had already done some troubleshooting which included verifying and updating their SDKs, combing through our backend logs, and attempting to debug a snippet of their code. So far, no luck. 

I’m reading through the ticket history and one of the very first replies we got from this user was that everything had been working prior to their account being suspended. Now, I re-route a lot of account suspended tickets — I know that it happens a lot and usually account administration handles it without any fuss. It was totally fair to assume that they had gone through that team already and taken care of that puzzle piece. 

I did think it was odd however that neither of my team members had responded to that bit of information or referenced it again. My brain starts churning the gears — what exactly happens to our API keys when an account is suspended? It makes sense to me that they would become invalid, which would prevent future attempts to generate access tokens or to use our API services. I run this by the team and, with none of us having tried it before, get the suggestion to suspend+reactivate my own test account and see for myself.

Cool. We have a game plan! I start opening some browser tabs, pulling up my own account info as well as the users so that I had everything I needed …

Right there. At the top. In huge, bold letters. 

‘ACCOUNT SUSPENDED’

Welp. 

Mr. Owl, how many developers does it take to notice that an account is inactive? The world does know, unfortunately, and the answer is embarrassing LOL",1,1630326474
2101,Thank you for helping me but here is a 400+ word message why you helped me wrong.,"I work for a small OEM company that builds pcs and sell them via different distributors. To find out anything about any configuration we made we prefer to work of the serialnumber as this is unique to every single device. We also have similar configurations which only differ by which mainboard is used or another CPU that is used and all those tiny differences that make a big difference at the end. Today I got a very interesting exchange with a customer that I helped figure out what he wanted but I did it wrong.  
  
His first email was as follow:  
Dear company,  
  
2 years ago I bought a pc with windows, but I wish the windows disk was bigger.  
Now I want to use a bigger one.  
Can you tell me what RAM is installed (manufacturer and how many slots are available 4x4 or 2x8 RAM installed?) and if the RAM I want to install would fit.  
Sadly I have no documents regarding this pc and I have no product name and I don't want to take the pc oout of the desk just to see if a serial number might be on the back or to open the case and see how many slots are available. You have to know this kind of information and be able to tell me if I can do that.  
(List of specs like CPU, GPU, amount of disk space on C: and D:, 64x Windows 10)  
I want to use (this) RAM and want to know if its compatible.  
  
My response was as this:
Dear customer,  
  
sadly I can't provide you correct information without a serialnumber.  
There is a freeware called ""Speccy"" that reads all the systemdata and gives you information like productnames of the components and such.  
With the productname you can easily search those on the manufacturers site and find all the needed information.  
  
This is a google translate of his respons:  
Thank you very much for your helpful tip with the Speccy, that worked wonderfully and now I know what I have. Of course this is a quick solution, but not really what you mean by ""the customer is king"" or customer-friendly service. ;-)
Therefore I have to say that it would be customer-friendly not only to clip the old serial numbers on the back of the computer, but to store them somewhere under the driver files on the computer. Who is constantly crawling under the desk where he has to determine a tiny number with a flashlight, just because he wants some information from the manufacturer. This is really tedious, especially when you have a dozen cables hanging on the computer, all of which just barely reach the socket. Or do you really expect that we all have desks in the middle of the room? As you can see, that's a typical male way of thinking. (Definition of men's thinking: construction of coffee machines with ultra-modern equipment and in the end all the pots spill because they let their women make coffee for them)
For advertising, companies like you make all sorts of changes so that it flashes everywhere, the customer is led to some partner site and the company logo appears permanently. A little more customer friendliness would be a good idea if you don't provide any support without a serial number.
And why do you actually need a serial number to determine the number and size of the ram banks? And let's be honest, that is completely superfluous for this question, even for a possible reason that is not enough.
The support of a manufacturer should actually know what he has sold, you will surely see that as well.
You only need to collect the data sheets of the computers on offer and write the date of the offer on it, then you can determine within a few minutes which complete systems you sold 2 years ago.
I don't know, but sometimes companies really trip themselves up because they don't come up with the simplest ideas. I just threw a product out of my company because they had such shitty support and overloaded the system with customer-unfriendly nerd functions. On the other hand, I also recommend computers to my company and they are constantly buying new computers for their more than 200 partner companies throughout the country.
You certainly want to shine in your job, so you can bring it in as an ""innovative suggestion"". Sometimes there is even a financial bonus for this.
Well that was a comment. As I said, you helped me so thank you and have a nice weekend  
  
I am unsure what to do with is insightful tip, I forwarded it to my coworkers and my superior hopefully they can figure it out.",1,1630311829

2106,'Something's wrong with the printer!',"Hey guys!

Currently I'm doing my apprenticeship in a local town hall in Germany to become a sysadmin. My final exams are coming up next year, so I'm pretty much aware of what I'm doing. Working for the government isn't really challenging. Most of the time you help coworkers with simple stuff like 'How to use your second monitor', replacing broken hardware or updating the servers. Really simple work if you ask me.

Right now we've got elections coming up and you can do a postal vote. We've set up a special office for this. This office got a pc, a printer and a barcode scanner so my coworkers don't have to type every name by hand. The barcodes are on the polling cards people get per mail.

One of my coworkers called me that she had some issues with the printer. It just won't work. She claimed that if the used that barcode scanner, the printer won't work which didn't make any sense. The only issue was that the printer wasn't set as the standard printer. I set it as the standard and told her to try again. She refused because she didn't want some important documents printed elsewhere which is understandable because it contains sensible data (it only tried to print it into OneNote which she also didn't understand). My coworker just refused to see that I've fixed the issue and wanted one of the other IT guys to come because she apparently can't trust me because I'm still an apprentice.

That one colleague she tried to call wasn't available so after half an hour of waiting and talking her into it, she finally tried it again. She was a bit shocked that it magically worked and we could move on. But she still was convinced that the barcode scanner was responsible for this issue.",1,1630187626

One day the admin assistant for the Senior Director flags me down. ""My computer is very slow. Can you look at it.""

Wow this machine is old. Still running plain old DOS. Early 90s, not unheard of, but every other system in the building was running Windows. I start looking around and find the root directory is filled with \*.tmp files. So I clear them all out and reboot. Zoom (relatively speaking) it boots.

She fires up WordPerfect and everything is fine.

A couple of weeks later, same thing. This time I stuck around to see her work. Starts WordPerfect, types up a document, prints it, and shuts off the computer. She grabs another set of notes, starts up the computer, types up the document, etc, etc.

I try to convince to do saves, to not shut off the computer every time. Nope, Nope, that's how she was trained so long ago and she's not going to change.

**PREFACE**

""We need a new tech on the team.  We have a team of three guys supporting almost 600 users.  Tickets are up almost 60% over the last five years and we can't keep up.  On top of that we have to migrate almost 500 workstations from Windows 7 to Windows 10.  How are we supposed to find the time to do that?""

My director, Laurie, looked at me tiredly.  We'd had this conversation many times, and the answer had always been 'no'.  I hoped this time would be different, but I knew not to hold to that hope too strongly. 

""I'll bring it up with Steve, but he won't want to spend the money on another person.""

Ah.  Steve.  The CEO.  The penny-pincher.  

""Look, I'm not even necessarily asking for a full-time person.  Even a part-time intern or whatever would be a huge boon to the department.  I'm just telling you we don't have the resources to keep up with day-to-day tasks much longer, nevermind a massive migration project.""

""I'll see what I can do.""

A few days later I got word from Laurie that it actually looked promising.  I began excitedly writing job descriptions for two different positions.  One for a full-time tier-1 helpdesk technician, and one for a part-time intern.  This was exactly what we needed.  A full-time helpdesk technician could work almost exclusively on Windows 10 upgrades and get us finished by January 2020 without us having to do much with it at all.  A part-time intern could at least take most of the burden off the main team.  

I sent the job descriptions over to Laurie the next day.  A few hours later I got the call.  We're definitely getting our guy.  

""That's fantastic.  Are we getting someone full-time or part-time?""

""Full-time.""

""Awesome.  Did you take a look at the job descriptions I sent over?  Do you think it needs any changes?""

The briefest of pauses.  ""Well...""

*Oh no.  No good can come of this.*

""He's already picked out, actually,"" she continued.

""Whose kid is it?""

""Was it that obvious?""

""Yes.  Whose kid?""

""Sherry.""

The director of HR?  You've got to be kidding.  Surely she knows better than this.  *sigh*

""Alright.  I'll get with her.""

*a few hours later*

""Hey, Sherry.  I understand your son will be starting with us soon.""

""Yes.  His name is Jordan.  Now you'll have to teach him, because he doesn't have much experience.  But he's very smart and he loves technology.""

""We'll teach him whatever he needs to know.""

""That's great!  He'll start in a few days.  And don't worry.  He'll be treated just like any other employee.""

**DAY 1** - The Arrival

7:50

""Welcome.  I'm Andy, I'll be your manager.  John and Daniel usually arrive around 8:30; they're the more senior sysadmins.  So how much experience do you have?""

""It's mostly just from playing around with computers at home and stuff to be honest.  I took a couple classes in school but I don't have a degree.""

""Well, as long as you're willing to learn we'll teach you everything you need to know.  I will tell you that a lot of your time - especially at the beginning - is going to be spent upgrading and imaging computers.  It's not going to be particularly fun work.  All of the computers here are still on Windows 7 and we need to be on Windows 10 by January 2020.  Along with imaging them you'll be upgrading a lot.  Some of them are over 10 years old and we'll be adding RAM and upgrading them to SSDs.""

story:

We installed a new robot cell with an IPC with Win10. My policy is that the customer gets an patched system which is up to date, an can decide if he wants to run it off grid, or connect it to something and takes the responsibility for security and updates. This customer does the later, and his external it-guy gets an local admin account and sets his things up (AV, Backup, ...)

After a few days the customer calls me and tells me that every night at around 9pm the IPC is shutting down, bringing the production to an halt. I have no clue what happens, so I decide to visit the site at 9pm and have a look.

Did you already guessed it?

Yes... the backup runs at 9pm. And the standard-setting for this customer is ""do the backup, and then shut the machine down"". Why? Because the it put the IPC in the office-group for the backup, and not the machine-group. And the office workers have to leave their pcs on, they make the backup and shut down.

So I get a call from our hardware guy, who is a great guy, but not the best troubleshooter. He is replacing someone's computer (He does a profile restore from the old computer, which copies down Desktop, Documents, etc, etc) and when he gave it to her, she complained it was incredibly slow on login and when he logged in it was taking a log time for things to load etc, she also mentioned she could not see the files on her desktop. 

He calls me up for some guidance. So I remote into the computer and sure enough nothing is showing on the desktop. The computer is definitely crawling too, I look at task manager, nothing seems to be particularly high as far as usage. 

Navigating into file explorer I go to the users desktop folder. They had over 2600 files on their desktop.....apparently Windows finally got fed up and decided it just cannot handle loading that many files at login. I promptly highlight all the files and put them into a new ""Old Desktop"" folder, then reboot the machine.

Of course it logs in like a dream and the remaining 7 folders that I left show up on the desktop. 

I've been in IT for 10 years and it never ceases to amaze me that someone would think having 2600+ items on their desktop wouldn't be a problem....I don't even understand how this person worked before on their old laptop with that many files.....",1,1630087994

I would generally make friends with the drivers at our different posts because they know where everything is, they can get you awesome deals on stuff etc. I was hanging out near their driver hut one day when one came out and I saw they had a computer the Embassy gave them for emails. What caught my eye was how this one driver was using the mouse. He was holding it in the air with his hand and manipulating it with his thumb. His first 2 fingers were on the buttons, while his thumb was underneath it moving the cursor on the screen. 

I asked my driver buddy why he was doing it that way, and he said that when that driver first started they told him that was how it was done as a joke, and he does it this way nowadays because he finds it easier to do than putting the mouse on the desk and moving it around that way, my buddy also said he does it because it makes other US staff do a double take and they might not ask him to do extra work. To this day I still laugh when I remember that, and occasionally I try to use my mouse in that manner.",1,1630083504
2118,The client never got a single email from us…,"Hi there! I would like to tell you in advance that I don’t work as tech support, but working in a team where everyone is 50+ makes me feel like I really do. When I ran into this subreddit, I’ve decided to share my story on how I saved the company I currently work for. Turns out not everyone is familiar with email marketing campaigns and how does it work.

&amp;#x200B;

I had to contact one of our clients recently, and I accidentally found out that they never got any email from us. Obviously, I have immediately reported this to my boss. That dude just checked the folder sent and said that the email is delivered. They never got any error reports saying that the email is inactive. Besides, it made them think that we are out of business, and shut down our company years ago.

&amp;#x200B;

I have no idea if you have faced this issue before or not, but have you ever tried to explain to your grandparents something about digital marketing? That’s how I feel every single day! I started to explain to my boss what email deliverability is and how it works. Besides, I even found online services on different websites. But how can I convince my boss that this service is actually gonna benefit us? Any piece of advice from experienced tech support workers will be highly appreciated. Because I lack experience in explaining something new to someone who doesn’t know what I’m talking about.

&amp;#x200B;

I’ve tried to do everything I can. For instance, cleaning the database from dead email addresses, adding unsubscribe links to emails, removing some links, and cutting the email size. Still, I don’t know if it’s possible to find out the average email deliverability score? Well, I had a lot of work to do to improve the situation somehow.

&amp;#x200B;

I see from the responses we get that I have improved the situation somehow. Now, everyone is asking me some complex tech questions at my office, and I have no idea how to reply.",1,1630078479

2124,Another win for the little guy?,"I work as a field tech for $ISP, a little local company in the U.S.

$client has been having issues lately with their gateway router, which is almost ten years old.

$client, being a fairly high-functioning adult with more sense than God gave a goose, uses this thing called a search engine, actually figures out that their gateway router is probably old, and replaces it.

$client gets a fairly basic home mesh system from the local box store, avoiding the kit from those vendors who want to just suck up ALL your data. $client gets this system home, plugged in, and powered up. Correctly!

$client's Smart TV, less than a year old, from the people who make those cool phones, connects up to the new Wi-Fi network without a problem and starts throwing 'cannot communicate with server' errors.

$client calls mesh system support. Support blames TV manufacturer.

$client calls TV support. Support blames mesh system manufacturer.

$client calls mesh system manufacturer support, conferences in TV manufacturer support. Both mutually agree to blame the ISP.

$ISP phone support determines $client's connection working great. Warns of service fee but $client has had enough and is totally willing to pay the fifty bucks to have someone actually look at their stuff.

Enter me, $FieldTech!

I quickly determine that the new router/mesh system is not, in fact, routing IP traffic. It is actually eating traffic. I log into the gateway, and then run the initial setup process. 

The new router begins routing traffic. The TV works!

$client mutters about recovering the service fee from their router manufacturer. $FieldTech agrees.

It's really not so much the client's fault here, either. S/he downloaded the appropriate smartphone app, connected to the appropriate wifi network, and saw the pretty 'congratulations, you're online!' screen presented by said app, just missed 'Tap here to finish setting up your network'.

Mostly I'm impressively aghast at the support for the mesh system. How did they miss needing to finish the INITIAL SETUP?",1,1629994869

2126,A story from the other side (from the customer side),"Don't know if I'm allowed to post this story here. I just spent 1 hour talking with about 4 or 5 different tech support people at two huge companies. One company supplies us with our emails and their name implies they are our daddy. The other company supplies us with our operating system and is continually updating it. 

I was asked to add the option to dial in from a cell phone to video conferencing calls... through a new video conferencing system that comes with our emails and the name implies we are all part of ""teams."" However, in order for people to dial in to those video conferencing calls we have to purchase a special phone number (audio-conferencing number) from the company that manages the ""teams"" conferencing. 

The ""daddy"" company cannot add the phone number, even though they sold us and provide and host our 365 email accounts. The ""teams"" company"" says they can't sell us the phone number... we have to switch all our email account to them first (throw away the  approx $1000 we paid for those emails for 1 year.)

I think it's funny that these two huge companies, one of which is much huger than the other, have a business agreement in which the smaller company is selling the larger company's products but refuses to allow the smaller company access to part of the necessary package.

Anyway, for now I guess we'll just be using the video-conferencing service who's name implies that we are zooming rapidly to our destination.

2133,I just grabbed your ASR disk and... it's ALL GONE!,"New guy joins the support team and we share an office.

I'm the more experienced one, so he's learning the ropes from me.

On one of his very first days, he gets a request to upgrade Windows on a laptop for some big mucky-muck.

Thinking that he'll impress me with his initiative, he starts the process before I get to work.

When I arrive, my new, somewhat reactive office-mate immediately grabs me and starts in with ""I'm in big, big trouble, I'm going to get fired!"" I can see that he's really worried. I can't imagine what he could have done at THIS place that could get him fired so quickly.

""Why, what happened?"" I asked.

""""I needed to upgrade a Windows laptop for \[important guy in corner office\] so I grabbed your install disk... and it... *whiped everything!""*

""What disk did you grab?""

He shows me a disk labeled ""ASR"". Oops. That's NOT a setup disk, it's an Automated System Recovery disk, used for automatically, mass-installing, Windows onto many devices at  the same time. You insert the disk, turn ON the system, and it immediately whipes the harddrive and installs Windows over the network.

I still kinda smile imagining what horrors must have been going through his head as he saw the harddrive suddenly start going crazy....instead of getting a normal Windows setup screen. And then it wouldn't boot afterward? Oh the pain he must have been feeling!

I tell him what he had just done. He asks me why I would have such a dangerous thing in my possession, and actually gets kinda mad at me.

He tells me that the laptop belongs to a *high-level* exec, and he's deathly afraid to tell him that all of his data is now gone. He's sure to be fired on the spot.

I laugh and say ""No, you won't. Come with me, watch and learn, we'll take care of it together. He should have backups or copies of anything important. If he's in such a position in the company, then he's fully aware of his responsibility to protect his and the companies data.""

We go to the guys office and I tell him what had happened. He's disappointed, *really* disappointed. I apologize for the accident, and tell him that we've removed every ASR disk so that it couldn't possibly happen again.

He asks about data recovery. Sure, we can atttempt that, but no guarantees, and it's expensive. I can tell that he's getting more agitated.

As a subtle reminder of *his* responsibilities, I casually mention ""You know, for quite some time now, Support has offered a few different services that will automatically backup your data and even your complete profile. You just never know, *even when things are going perfectly*, when a harddrive might fail, a laptop gets dropped or stolen...""

He stood there and I see a transformation come over his face. He gets it.

""Yeah, I should have enrolled this into the \[automatic backup process\] a long time ago."" He even knew the name of the backup software we were using?

We eventually leave and  never hear of it again.

2134,Client cannot accept they're wrong,"Hey TFTS, first time posting, which is odd since I've worked all my professional life in application support and couldn't think of a story to post even though I have thousands.

My first job in London was providing 1st and 2nd line of support to a reporting software my company built and sold to clients in the financial sector.

We had two types of clients: hosted or in-house install. While the first were easy to debug (log in to their environment, replicate and assess, all while having full access to the back end), the others were less so for obvious reasons, yet we kept a (virtually stale) copy of their initial environment to provide some semblance of support. This story, obviously, is about the latter type.

The software itself was like Tableau, in which you add objects to a sheet (graphics, tables, images,...) to create a template, and the workflow fills in the latest data as often as you want it (daily, weekly, monthly,...) and generates the final report in the format you want, the most common being Word or PDF.

Also, the software used a proprietary third party software to convert Word documents into PDF. Don't recall which one it was, but we would buy the license ourselves and would give it to the client for their in-house install. We didn't only recommend this software in our install documentation but insisted that they use it since our product only ""supported"" this vendor in particular (meaning it could probably work with others, but we only tested this particular one, so could only ensure it works as expected with it and it alone).

So, the ticket in question was floating around for a while, bouncing from one Support member to another, and no one could figure it out. We were only 4 in the Support team, so it was bound to land on my plate eventually. Also, side note, I was the youngest (by far) in the team, and my impostor syndrome was high, so I was dreading my turn to have a go at this issue.

The problem was that the generated PDF reports were showing the objects completely misaligned compared to what they were supposed to look like. Moreover, this only happened when generating PDFs; Word docs came out as expected. 

So, this being an in-house installation, we could only try to replicate it on our end to no avail. A co-worker tried to get a copy of their database to get our environment in line with the client's, but that was turned down because of ""sensitive information"" that they couldn't share (what's the point of non-disclosure contracts?). Another co-worker tried a screen sharing session but all it helped for was to see the report being generated incorrectly, since their IT team wouldn't let us take a look at the back end and see if the software was installed properly.

By then, the client was getting impatient with how long it was taking for this issue to be resolved. So having this information telling me how tied my hands were, plus the pressure on being the last line of defense, I do the first thing I can come up with: I check in Acrobat Reader who is the PDF Producer of the file the client sent. Usually, you would expect to see the name of the third-party software as the creator, but lo and behold, the client was using some other tool for the PDF conversion (why? As I said, we provided the license for FOR FREE!!! So it wasn'ta matter of saving pennies). 

So, I happily send my reply to the client stating ""Unfortunately, you're using a software we don't support, please use [product name] as is specified in our documentation.""

One would expect the issue to be closed: the client was caught red-handed using our software incorrectly, thus in breach of contract. However, as you read the title of this story, this was not the case. All I got in return was a condescending reply to my email CC'ing the account manager on our company and my boss stating ""This is ridiculous, [Account Manager's name]. This has taken long enough. Can't someone fix the damn problem?""

I wish I could say the story had a satisfying ending but unfortunately for me, my company was ""too British"" in their mentality and followed the creed of ""the customer is always right"". I didn't hear back on this issue, and luckily that client didn't raise many tickets, so I didn't have to deal with them again. My guess is that the AM had to convince them to use the third-party software we supplied, but I never asked her how that discussion went.

All I got was a chuckle from the rest of the team saying ""how didn't I think about that before?"" and a pat on the back from my manager which would come back and haunt me for the rest of my days at that company since I became known as the ""last resort"" guy, which meant I had to deal with all the troublesome tickets.",1,1629819584

What's a firewall? - The IT Company That Replaced Me","So, I do freelance IT for small businesses. One of my customers decided to replace me. The ""company"" they replaced me with is really just the IT Director of the local community college. He is a people manager, and know next to nothing about actual IT. But he's a friend of one of the employees and he's cheap.  So I tell my customer good luck and contact me if the every need me.

It wasn't even a week and the first thing this guy tried to do he botched.

I get a call from him in a panic. He was tasked with replacing their ancient AVAYA phone system with a modern VOIP system.  This is what he did:

He tested all the phones connected at his office, and they worked. The next day he takes them out to the customer's office. He plugs a phone directly into the ISP gateway and the phone connects. So he calls the VIOP company and tells them all is good, the phones are connecting correctly, and they can start porting the phone numbers over from the POTs lines to the VOIP service.

While the porting is happening, he starts disconnecting the old phones at people's desks and connecting the new VOIP phones.  And when he is done he realizes none of the phones are connecting.

The VOIP company tells him to run a connection test tool on his laptop plugged in through one of the phones and sure enough the connection is being blocked.

But by this point the numbers are already ported to the VOIP service and the customer is without phones, and he has no clue why they aren't working.

That's when I get the call. He explains what he did and I asked him why he didn't test the phones from behind the firewall. And I shit you not, his exact words were ""What's a firewall?""

Seriously, he had no clue what a firewall was. He always just assumed you plugged everything into the ISP gateway and used that. I was floored. This is a guy that is doing business IT and he doesn't know what a firewall is.

Oh, and the kicker, his next project is to set up a site to site VPN connection between their current office and a new office they just rented. He told them he totally knows how to do that.  They guy that doesn't know what a firewall is claims he knows how to setup up site to site VPNs.

So I logged in remotely and set up the firewall properly to work with the VOIP phones. I'm sure the owner of the business will question why I had to be brought in to fix the phones when he receives my detailed bill.

TL;DR - Customer of mine when with a cheaper friend of an employee for their IT and fired me. The person they hired doesn't even know what a firewall is.",1,1629737569

2140,Troubleshooting cheat...,"I recently read a post from someone telling a story of one of his students not checking his hardware while troubleshooting a problem and it reminded me of my early days in electronics.

I got my electronics training in the Navy. Basic Electronics School was the base level training you got back then and they had labs where you would have live hardware with simulated failures you were required to troubleshoot.

Since when I joined the Navy I had already had two years of Electronics in college, BES was pretty boring to me. But I did have one experience that really changed my ability to troubleshoot.

Part of the training was to do visual inspections on the hardware. You know. Look for blown capacitors or burnt out resistors. Maybe an exploded IC chip. 

So the first couple of times I did just that. But at some point I realized that I could see just how these simulated failures were created. Shorted cap? A bit of fine wire under the cap. Open trace? Razor cut on the bottom of the board. Resistors painted with the wrong color codes. Etc. 

Got to the point where I was not even powering up the equipment before writing my assessment. I flew through that program. And because of that experience to this day I do a solid visual inspection before ANY other troubleshooting. It saves SO much time and effort.",1,1629692880
2141,Check the hardware,"TL;DR at the end.

Some years ago I needed a particular sort of sensor for my biology research. It was neither high-precision nor particularly complex, but it was strange. No one sold anything like it. So I designed and built the sensors I needed on a minimal budget, on a scratched-up table at home, using a soldering iron half my own age. And then, through a series of improbable events, this sensor got a lot of attention. It made the college I work at look good and to this day if you search for my real name what you’ll probably find is the college’s press releases about how my device will solve world hunger and cure AIDS while you sleep. As an indication that even the college did not believe this they rewarded me with a $15 gift certificate at the local coffee shop.

However, the computer science (CS) department did notice that I had just done something that looked very much like “Internet of Things” and made me an offer: instead of building my next device on a table at home using a soldering iron from the Late Paleolithic I could use their very nice lab, with lots of equipment, and even raid their parts bins, as long as I also passed off some of my knowledge to their students. And so I ended up spending a lot of time in the CS lab. This story comes from that time. Some details of actual projects have been fuzzed because specific projects would de-anonymize me quite easily.

On the day this story begins I am in lab laying out a circuit. As I am doing so I am chatting with the students, a small group who I have come to know fairly well, who spend most of their free time in the lab tinkering with things. One student, who I will dub Hamilcar (who doesn’t like the Second Punic War?) calls me over for troubleshooting.

I get up from my chair, careful to bring my cup of coffee with me. When troubleshooting with students a cup of coffee is essential, because you can raise it to your face and take a sip from it to hide the fact that while your voice is saying, “That happens sometimes,” your face is saying, “I don’t think you’ve fully recovered from that brain injury.”

Hamilcar’s project involves a speaker. He’s quite early on in working on it and only has the speaker attached to an audio control board/amplifier which is, in turn, attached to an Arduino. (Arduinos are programmable microcontrollers.) Hamilcar points to his screen where a small program is open in an IDE. “This \[points\] should play a small tune through here \[points\]. But nothing is happening.”

“When did it break?” I ask.

“It never worked,” he responds.

This seems strange. I question him a bit more. As I think we all know the right way to build this device would be: 1) wire up the speaker, run current through and make sure you hear something. 2) write a tiny piece of code that just makes some sort of noise, verify that you can get the code on the Arduino and get noise out of the speaker. 3) turn “make a noise” into “make these specific noises”. What Hamilcar has done is wire everything together, write a giant block of code, and then test it.

“Have you checked the hardware?” I ask. Always start troubleshooting at step zero. I then have to explain that I mean “have you done anything to verify that the hardware works?”

“It’s wired correctly,” Hamilcar says. This is not what I asked.

“Have you ever gotten any sound out of that speaker?” I ask. “A blip when you plugged it in? A short code snippet that just makes it hum? Anything to test it?”

“No!” Hamilcar exclaims, clearly unreasonably annoyed by these questions. Other students look up from their projects and stare at him in surprise. “It’s plugged in correctly! I’m not an idiot!”

I bring my coffee cup up to my face and take a long sip. “But did you test it?”

“No!” Hamilcar yells. I understand, a bit, where his frustration is coming from. He does have some real skills from his own, independent study, and nothing he’s done yet has been able to showcase this. He feels like we don’t believe that he knows things. On the other hand, he’s being an ass.

I bring the coffee cup down and give Hamilcar The Look. If you ever find yourself teaching teenagers or young adults make sure to practice The Look. Done correctly, the victim should feel the chill of the coming winter creeping into their bones and hear the distant howl of the first wolves picking up their trail. “This is,” I say, gesturing expansively with my coffee mug while continuing to glare, “Computer SCIENCE. We TEST things. Check your hardware.” I then remind him that the day before I had wasted time debugging a bad solder joint.

Hamilcar makes his saving throw against The Look. “I know how to solder!”

I point out that the years of his life are but a blink of my eye, and that while I had learned to solder as the great ice sheets retreated at the end of the Younger Dryas he had learned to solder two weeks earlier, from me. And that his solder joints still closely resembled metal potatoes.

“You’re not helping!”

“No,” I finally agreed, “I’m not. And I won’t, until you check your hardware.” Then I walked back to my bench. And thus began the descent into madness.

Day One: Hamilcar has discovered that Arduinos are not very good at keeping time by themselves. He has a theory that this is, somehow, messing up the speaker. Perhaps the sound frequencies are being compressed into the ultrasonic, or something. He’s fiddling around with clock chips, which are really only needed when your time intervals are hours or days. Obviously, this just further complicates his untested circuit and doesn’t help.

Day Two: Hamilcar spends an hour undoing his clock chip changes from yesterday. He is now convinced that he is running the Arduino at the wrong internal clock speed. This can happen to the chip-brain of the Arduino but only if you buy that chip yourself and wire it up. Inside an Arduino that won’t happen.

Day Three: Hamilcar is now propounding a new theory to the other students. Arduinos use a C-derived coding language. But what if this language does not handle global and local variables in the same way? Much like the Carthaginian invasion of Italy, this theory serves only to cause a lot of destruction and get people angry without actually making any progress towards winning the war.

Day Four: Hamilcar is bouncing his latest idea off another student. At this point Hamilcar’s broken circuit and his refusal to test the hardware have become a running joke. Before he gets past the first sentence of his new theory the other student asks, “Have you checked the hardware?” Hamilcar explodes in anger. The other students just shake their heads, and I eventually have to tell him to use his inside voice.

Day Five: Hamilcar is hunched over his station, muttering something in an unknown language. Is this a dark ritual to the old gods of blood and fire, meant to strike me down for questioning his soldering skills? Has he completely snapped and is speaking in a new language that makes sense only to him? I listen more closely. No, he’s just swearing continuously under his breath.

Day Six is a Saturday. As a biologist I sometimes have to come in to work on a weekend to keep my living study subjects, well, living. I had also glued some pieces together on a device on Friday, so I swing by the CS lab to see if they set up correctly, and, if so, to glue the next set.

The lab is quiet, empty of students. As much as I like joking around with the students it’s relaxing to be alone and able to focus. I finish my own project and decide to check Hamilcar’s project. If I can debug it I’ll steer him correctly on Monday.

There’s no multimeter on Hamilcar’s station (of course) but once I grab one his power and ground check out. The Arduino is pinned-out correctly, and I’m getting power where I should there, too. The audio controller/amplifier is a bit of a mystery. I haven’t used this design before. I unlock the computer and find that Hamilcar already has the wiring diagram open. Power is solid. Ground is ground. LVL is….not attached to anything. What the hell is LVL, anyway? I know that the chip can do much more complicated things than what Hamilcar is doing with it, so maybe it’s not needed. But debugging means figuring out what things are. I find a webpage where someone is using LVL on this chip in their own circuit. I look at what they seem to be doing with it. It’s not amazingly helpful. I bend over to poke at the chip with the multimeter, just to see if I can tell if LVL is output or input. As my head gets close to the chip I hear a faint sound in the quiet of the room. I pick up the speaker and put it up to my ear. It’s playing a tune. Right. LVL. As in “sound level”. Thirty seconds later I’ve decoded the wiring diagram and have LVL attached to 5V power. The speaker is humming out a tune clear as day. I leave a text file open on the computer. “Checked your hardware. Amplifier on chip was not powered.”

Two months later we’re sitting in lab. A new student loudly complains to no one in particular that his starter exercise (get an LED to blink) isn’t working. “Did your LED power on solidly when you first plugged it in?” I ask.

“No,” the new student says. “Does that matter?”

A wave of apocalyptic fury breaks over us, a roar of sound and anger. It’s Hamilcar. “CHECK YOUR DAMN HARDWARE!”

TL;DR: Student has an issue with a program. I tell him to check the hardware. He doesn’t. It’s the hardware.",1,1629686139

2145,My computer won't open since you guys worked on it.,"So, let me bring you back in time to when I first started working in IT. Which was roughly a year ago. Before I had worked this job, I had zero IT experience, just my experience of solving problems by googling them, and building computers, coding a little, stuff like that. So I had been hired for this job which was a consumer tech store, with a helpdesk that the general public could come to and pay us to fix their machines. It was my very first day. 

I had been showed around the shop, had people show me the ticketing system, and watched a few interactions with some customers from the more experienced techs there. They decided, ""hey, he seems ready to man the front counter and take the next few people that come in"". So, they let me just hang out and wait. Cue the user. 

An older woman walks in with her laptop, plops it on the counter. 

Me: Hi, how can I help you?

User: Well, I had you guys replace the screen on my computer, and now it doesn't open up. 

She had a laptop, and was clearly irate at the fact that we could be so incompetent as to give her a laptop back that didn't even open. I watched her attempt to open it. The problem was clear. She was attempting to open the laptop from the hinge side. 

Me: Alright, well let me go ahead and give it a try.

I place my hands onto the laptop lid, and simply slide my fingers under the display, and open the laptop, making sure that I don't open it from the hinge side. A 50/50 chance, but by god I did it.

The laptop is open. I look at her. She looks at me. I don't really remember what I said, but it was most likely something like, ""well, looks like its working now."" She called me a smartass and left. 

This was my very first issue I troubleshooted in IT. This issue is what made me sure that I could do this job, and I would be good at it. I was filled with confidence, and it was a great first day. 

To this day, it boggles my mind that this occured. This woman picked up her laptop from us. We make a point of showing the user that the computer works and their problem is solved when they pick it up and pay. In the case of a laptop screen replacement, we probably turned it on and showed her it worked. It just shocks me that this person, who most likely saw it be opened and working, took it home, attempted to open it, and always tried from the same side. It shocks me that this person, instead of doing literally any level of problem solving, picked up their laptop, got into their car, and drove to our store, had me open it, and drove back to their home. I would assume they invested at least 30 minutes round trip.

To this day, I'm still not quite sure what to say to people when the problem is them and it is very clearly them. I usually just say, ""haha we all make mistakes I guess"", but even this feels insufficient.",1,1629647985
2146,“Flosstradamus crashed my laptop?”,"So this happened like a year ago. If you don’t know who Flosstradumus is, he is a DJ who got big making EDM Trap music, take a listen to the mixtape I’m about to tell you about and you’ll see why this is so funny. 


Anyway customer comes in with a laptop with a sporadic screen issue. Laptop is fine but will shut down or have a glitchy screen shortly after startup. It also needs a new battery but that’s a different issue that has little effect on this issue. The customer also said “do any upgrades you can id like to keep it for a few more years.” It was almost 8 years old but I had the same model I kept for 10+ after upgrading it. 

So I open it up expecting it to be a loose ribbon cable. Nope. Let’s upgrade the memory see if that fixes it. Nope ok. …Hmm let’s run a scan on the hard-drive. Error. Ah that’s it let’s give it an SSD, (it was built right before SSDs became standard.) I start transferring their data and boom something errors out. The error looks suspicious it’s just a bunch of emojis and broken text. I look and notice it stopped transferring in the music folder. So I go through their music, good collection, tons of nostalgia, this person was about my age and was recommended by a friend so we had a lot of similar tastes. Anyways I’m scrolling and I see something that looks like this. “⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️ BANNED MIX TAPE ⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️” with a bunch of that broken text and more emojis. 

I laugh because I know the artist and remember that stupid shit DJs would do to stand out. 

I renamed the file and poof errors go away and the laptops working fine. I transfer the data and install the new SSD. Customer comes in and asked what was wrong with it. I tell them it was an old Flosstradamus mixtape with a bad file name and they responded…. “Flosstradamus  crashed my laptop?” 

We had a good laugh and since we were in similar friends groups I ask them from time to time if their laptop stills going strong and yup that was the real issue.",1,1629645992
2147,Can you rebuild our company?,"Several years ago, I worked as a software developer for a company that provided network and desktop support for our customers.

This story is about a new customer we got, that was an ecommerce business.  They hired us to fix some of their servers, but the problem was much, much deeper than that.

It seems that the company had, over a period of several years, gradually let go each and every person in their IT department.  The last IT employee had provided a couple of Word documents containing some server IPs and admin credentials, and then they let him go.  This seemed to be part of a larger pattern, as the company was housed in a large business complex, which they used to fully occupy.  However, half of the building was now unoccupied, a significant portion of the building was sublet to other companies, and the current staff was maybe half a dozen people.

This company had over a dozen servers, but no network diagram, and no one there who even understood what most of the servers did.  Our techs did their best to sort it out based on the ""documentation"" from former IT, and managed to restore the server that failed (that server failing was what prompted the company to reach out to us).

A couple of weeks later, I was called in to meet with the person running the company (the actual owners were completely removed from the company's operations; it was simply a cash cow that they had zero involvement with).  It seemed that separate from the initial failed server, their ecommerce site was now broken.  

Keep in mind, this ecommerce site is literally the entire product of the company.

They wanted me to fix the site.  However, they didn't have any documentation for the site.  They didn't have anyone on staff who understood the code base.  They didn't have credential to the source control.  They didn't even know which servers the application was hosted on.  Apparently they had outsourced 100% of the development of the application to Russian programmers (we're in the US) nearly a decade ago.  The programmers built the app, configured all of the interactions, and provided zero documentation (or possibly the company discarded the documentation).

After some investigation, I discovered that the application was actually scattered among at least 3 different servers.  2 of the servers were AWS, and... the company did not know the username and password of the AWS account.

They did have credentials for the third server, but that was simply the host for the front-end interface, and a customer mailing list.  All of the actual business logic (which the manager I was working with could only explain in the most rudimentary terms) was hosted on those two AWS sites.

I did find the problem (an expired security certificate), and we got them back up and running, but I did my best to explain that if anything else went wrong, there was an excellent chance that there would be no way to fix it.

2 weeks later, the site went down again.  One of the AWS sites wasn't accepting HTTP requests anymore.  When I explained that I couldn't access the server to find out what was happening, because they didn't have credentials, I was asked if I could just rebuild the application on a new server.  I told them that it was possible, but that I'd need someone to explain, in detail, all of the necessary business logic, and that they'd lose their customer database (again, no credentials) and have to start that over from scratch.

They said ""oh, okay,"" and that was the end of the conversation.

I have no idea if they're still in business.",1,1629632853

2149,Roll perception check.. critical failure.,"Soooo, I just read the funniest email about a ticket I had worked on last week.

I had a user call in last week saying that her laptop webcam doesn't work in any application. I asked her to try it in Teams and in the Microsoft camera app, she says she had and it doesn't work in either.
No worries, I'll remote in and take a look.

Sure enough it seems like the computer thinks the camera is working but just seeing black.

I asked her if there was a shutter on the camera - no

I asked her if there was anything obstructing the camera - no

Nothing like a sticker, or anything behind the glass of the screen - no

No damage, no nothing - no

I asked if there were any switches near the camera - no

So you can see the camera lens in the centre top of your screen and there is no damage or obstruction - yeah it's all clear.

Ok, maybe there is an issue with the sensor and the software isn't recognising a problem with the signal.

Time to troubleshoot.

So I went on to try a bunch of typical solutions, reinstalled the drivers, did Windows updates, tried disabling and reenabling or removing and readding the camera in device manager, tried looking on the Dell site for the latest drivers for the camera. I go as far as to update all the drivers and the BIOS on the computer, nothing is working.

I ran the Dell diagnostic tools and it runs through, doesn't seem to attempt to fix anything just comes up at the end saying failure with a warning exclaimation symbol, no error code, no nothing.

The Windows hardware diagnostic tells me the camera is fine.

I call Dell and tell them we have a device where the camera is not working and nothing I have done seems to fix it, I'm getting an error from the dell diagnostic but there is no code or description, we need a technician to come out.

They ask me the usual about physical damage, BIOS and driver updates, etc.. but they agree we need to send a tech out.

I give Dell the clients contact details with the ok from the client so that Dell can organise a warranty visit with the client.

They have called the client to confirm there is no damage and do their own troubsleshoot and everything.
I get the email Friday to say the technician is en route.

Awesome the client will be happy with a quick turn around. I finish up for the day as I am on the early shift where I work. Job well done.

I just checked my emails today to find the technicians report and opened it because why not, lets see what the problem was. I want to know if there was anything I had missed or that I could check in future, as you do.

Technicans notes: Opened the shutter.

..... ""Opened the shutter""

You what?

I just wish I was there for the moment that the Dell technician walks in, opens up the laptop, and flicks the camera shutter open. I would have loved to have seen the Jackie Chan confused look on his face and the look of total embarassment on the client.

Lesson of the day: client's are stupid, and there is no winning..

TLDR: client is obtuse, misses camera shutter when directed to check for one, Dell warranty technician finds it instead.

2150,"Document your network, or else!","Way back at the turn of the century, 2001 I think, I was working in a University computer research department.  The guy who had hired me had moved on and I was the only support person around until we could hire someone.  Our network infrastructure was pretty primitive, no firewall, no managed switches, and poorly documented cable mapping.  Our primary patch panel had over 400 drops, some were labeled with what room and plate number they connected to, many did not.  The wall plates in many offices were not labeled, or worse, incorrectly labeled.  At this time we didn't have a cable tracer.

One day I got an email from the University computer security guys, they had been contacted by someone reporting malicious activity from the University, the IP traced back to my department.  The IP was on one of my Class C networks, so I went to work to find the malicious machine.   We had a lot of students running ""self administered"" systems in those days, so this was not completely unknown.   

The problem was our switches were so old I had no way to find which switchport was connected to the bad system.  I could narrow things down to a stack of switches, each had 48 ports although not all were connected.  I set up a laptop running a ping to the ""bad"" IP, and started pulling the patch cables one at a time.   Really basic, right?   I found what appeared to be the correct connection after a few minutes.  So, the immediate problem was solved, this system was off the network, but I still needed to find the system, find the student, ensure the system got patched, all that jazz.

I traced the patch cord to the patch panel, it was labeled with a room and plate number.  No problem, I had a sub master key so I could access every office in that area.  I walked to the room and found, no computer, no monitor, no keyboard, not even a desk.  There was a lot of junk, old chairs, a futon, a partition (so the room could be divided for two people), lots of various trash on the floor.   I guessed one of the grad students had actually been living in it, against the rules but it happened.

I was really scratching my head, checked the wallplate in the room, nothing plugged in at all.  There were a couple of old power cords scattered around, but no computer.  Went back to the server room and repeated all the steps,  confirmed I had disconnected the correct switchport.  

I spent some time checking nearby offices, in case the wallplate was in a different office, but found nothing.  It was really bugging me so I went back to the original office and did a more complete search.  And of course, there was an old desktop computer, no monitor or keyboard, hidden behind the futon and connected to a second wall port.   I left a ""please see me"" note on the computer, removed the network cable, and asked our department administrator who was in the office.  No one was.  OK, who USED to be in the office.  Some student, no longer at the University.  

Back to the office, yanked the computer (it wasn't a university owned computer, student must have bought it himself).   I stored the computer and figured I'd wait to see if anyone complained.   No one did so after a month or so sent it to e-waste.

I also created a project for myself get a cable tracer and a label maker and had some students start checking and labeling the drops in the whole department.  There were many occasions when I'd get a request to activate a wallplate and spend an hour trying to figure out which patch panel it connected to.",1,1629587530

2152,magically changing network addresses,"Another story from days working support in University.   Several years ago my department outgrew the office space in our building.  We made a deal with another department in the building next door to get some additional offices, in return we provided computer support.  This wasn't too hard since their computer needs were not as difficult as ours, plus the network was 100% maintained by our campus network team.

Late one afternoon I got a call from a graduate student in the other building.  The desktop system he had appeared to be working but he had no network access.  I thought maybe the network card was bad (this was an older system that used a PCI ethernet card), so I grabbed a spare and headed over.  Since this machine was on a different campus network than our department it used a local username and password, like a laptop, so we could login even without any network connection at all.  

I logged in and started troubleshooting, checked the network config and restarted networking (Linux box using DHCP), and it got an address, so I was stumped for a moment.  I kept poking around and restarted networking, forced getting a new DHCP lease, stuff like that, and then the shoe dropped.  I was getting an unroutable address, 192.168.x.x when I knew that the campus DHCP server gave out addresses in real University IP space.  I checked another computer in the same office and it had a University IP.  Since unroutable IPs were blocked at the building gateway, no surprise this machine had no internet access.  

At this point I guessed someone in a nearby office had probably plugged in a wireless router so they could have their own private wifi, and it was configured to serve DHCP on the wired side.  I looked around the office but there wasn't anything there.  I restarted the DHCP client on the computer a few times and finally got an address on the proper network.  I told the student that he should be OK for the rest of the day and called the main network guys and explained what I found.  

They asked me to try and find the ""rogue"" DHCP server, but I explained I had no keys to any of the offices and it almost 5 o'clock, so sorry, I was out of there.   I knew they had master keys to every building and office, unlike me, so it was up to them.

I found out the next day someone had come over and searched around until they the router and yanked it.  I'm guessing they left a nasty note for the owner.",1,1629499686
2153,Mr. Know-it-all does not know it all,"A while ago, I got a funny ticket from a well known problem user. He had it all; thought he knew everything, was impatient, acted disrespectfully, and best of all throttled his system every chance he got. I can't count how many laptops this guy went through under my care. 

One day, he put in a ticket about not being able to connect to the VPN. My stomach sank and I knew I was in for a bad morning. Usually, these issues aren't too complicated but this guy took things to another level with his complaints and general bad nature.

I  start off by making sure he has the right access. Check. Next I look at the firewall logs to see if there's any errors coming from his system when he tries to connect. There are some errors but they actually don't point me anywhere useful.

I'm a bit lost at this point and illogically try to ping his machine just because I don't know what else to do other than tell him to reinstall his VPN client. 

Surprise: it works. Oddly enough, it doesn't have an IP from the VPN's DHCP scope which makes no sense. I fired back a carefully typed email asking where he was connecting from. He replied: from company HQ building D.

Turns out this genius was visiting the company HQ and trying to connect to the VPN but couldn't figure out why it wasn't working for him. He could've accessed everything on the network without the VPN but instead tried and failed, then got frustrated and made a ticket. Of course, upon realizing his mistake, he left no reply whereas on other tickets, he will leave complaints if the solution doesn't perfectly fit his needs.

2154,Math...what a concept,"Back in 2009, our company purchased a horribly mismanaged company mostly for their technical ability and their customers.  I was asked to come to the President’s office and meet one of the “crown jewels” of this acquisition was a guy we will call “Fred.”

For background, our IT Department falls under the accounting department and headed by the CFO/Treasurer.  I do not work for or report to the President in any way, but professional courtesy he usually gets what he wants (for the most part.)

Fred seemed nice enough.  We exchanged pleasantries and the president mentioned that he would be needing a new, beefy, top-of-the-line PCs for this new venture.  I told him “No problem!  Just let me know the specs and I’ll get it done.” and I went on my merry way.

Later that day the president asked me to stop back by his office for “a little chat.”

Towards the end of the day, I swung by his office. 

The president wanted to let me know that Fred and his teams were “really smart” guys and that they would “probably be the IT team” for the company “someday in the future.”  It would be best to really do a good job on this as this guy would likely be my boss at some point in the future.

So I was already kind of bristling at this because, as it stood, I was in charge of IT (even if it was only me and one other guy) and I didn’t like the idea of a demotion.

Then he handed me a piece of paper with the specs that Fred wanted and needed “to be able to work properly.”  

It read (going from memory) as follows:

HP or Dell Laptop
Must have Intel i7-720QM
Windows 7 32 Bit
32 GB of RAM
500 GB HD
ATI or NVidia graphic card

I kind of snickered.  I said “can we call him?”  

We got Fred on the phone.

“Fred, did you mean to specify Windows 7 64 Bit?”

“No,” says Fred “It has to be 32 bit.  64 Bit won’t work with the applications I use.”

“Okay.  So then we’ll drop the memory down to 4 GB.”

“No!” says Fred “I need 32 GB or I won’t be able to work efficiently.”

So I tell the “really smart” guy that 32 GB won’t work in a 32 bit system.  

He insists it will, he knows what he needs and what he is doing, and just order it the way he specified.  He can configure it to work just fine.

I tell him that I would love to see this (as it basically breaks math.) 

Long story short, I order it and, Lo and Behold, a 32-bit system can only use 4 GB of memory.  

He tells the president that I must have done something wrong with the set up or something on the network was preventing it from using all 32 GB.

*Facepalm*

Later in the week my CFO/Boss wants to have a meeting with me to discuss why we cannot configure it the way he wants and what we can do to solve this issue.  So I go to the meeting and my boss asks me “what is preventing you from configuring this the way he wants.”

“Math.”

“Math?”

“Yes, Math.  You see what 32 bit and 64 bit means is how many address registers a computer can access in memory.  32 bit means it can access 2^32 address registers or a little over 4 billion ones and zeros, or 4 gigabites.  That’s it.  It’s not up for debate.  I can stick a hundred sicks of memory in there and it will still only use 4 GB.  It cannot be changed because you cannot change the math.”

“Did you explain it to him?”

“No, I did not.  Because he said he wanted it that way and he could configure it to work.”

“But,” said the CFO, “You said it couldn’t work.  What can he do to make it work?”

“Nothing.  Again…math.”


In the end Fred said he would “Just deal with it.”  He lasted about eight months and was asked to leave after he spent $7500 at a Vegas strip club with “clients” one night.

Apparently, math was never a strong suit of his.",1,1629488107

2156,"""Why replace something that is working? Wait it burned down? Can we fix it?""","I saw the other thread about using Dosbox to make a ~20 years old printer run, and it reminded me of this story:

At my current workplace, we previously had a 1960's industrial control system with electro-magnetic relays and mechanical cam timers. Not a single transistor in that system. There was a project to reverse-engineer it years ago to relearn how that system works because no one knew how it worked anymore, but it was cancelled for whatever reason.

For context of what a electro-magnetic relay control system looks like, here's a video of an elevator using that: https://youtu.be/_xjXdjj2m5Q?t=79

That turned out to be a problem when the system caught on fire. Repairing it was deemed impossible due to many of the documentation being missing or damaged. All we had to go off of was knowing how the system should operate, and the operators' various troubleshooting techniques whenever something went wrong. None of the industrial controls vendors were willing to help with repairing the burned down system. I can't blame them because I'd imagine most IT admins would slowly back away if they were asked to help repair a crashed IBM System/360 or IBM 1401 mainframe that had no backups.

I had a user call in about a few keys on their laptop not working so well. $User is User, $SR is me.

I remote connect, update some drivers, even flash to a previous restore point- it's the same issue, making me think it's something hardware related.

2158,How i saved a company business with dosbox.,"Hi.

First and foremost, sorry for any mistakes. I'm not a native English speaker, first time poster here and not caffeinated yet. It's still early in the morning here.

So, back in 2016, i had my ""real"" first job as an it tech. I was already doing some it support in my previous jobs but it was more because I was ""filling the gaps"" rather than a real it job.

I was doing hotline for a company that is selling a software for laboratories. In reality, i was doing all type of IT support depending on which customer was calling.

One day, one of the customer i had a lot of interactions with called me. Since their IT got was on a sick leave (he got burn out) i was doing more than just support for our software for them. My boss had a deal with them, apparently.

They decided to renew their old computers to newer ones while their IT guy was off. I'm talking throwing some XP SP1 computers for windows 7 computers. Why windows 7 ? They needed computers with a fucking serial/parallel port (don't remember which one of the two).

That's where shit went south. My mission ? Make their 20 ish year old printer (a very specific one that prints stuff that gets on the testing tubes) compatible with their new computers. 

They used to have a all in one program made by their previous IT guy. A 16 bit program. New computers are windows 7 64 bits. Not even windows pro.

So my first plan was to find some updated program to make that thing work. There should be at least some 32 bit driver right ? Lol. Didn't found any updated single piece of software for that shit. After half a day of searching,i came to the conclusion that i would have to make their old program work.

Luckily for me, i have been in association that does retro gaming for years by that point. So I thought, ""could that all in one program run in dosbox ??"". 

And it did. Mostly.

It wasn't able to directly communicate with the printer. So, what i ended up doing, was creating a batch dime that was running, in command line :

* Their old program into dosbox
* Dosbox ""prints"" in a virtual printer (which is a text file)
* When it's done, the text file gets pushed through serial/parallel to feed the printer
* Printer gets shit done.

And it work. It worked quite well actually. Took me 2 days but it worked.

The printer got replaced a couple months after that because it broke. Oh, well 🤷‍♂️",1,1629441397

2162,"Non-IT Director tells sysadmin, ""This is a network issue. You don't do network issues. Do NOT touch the network!""","Had a ""fun"" run in with the director of another department yesterday.  She had mentioned to a coworker of mine that she couldn't scan to email from the printer in her office.  I'm the ""printer whisperer"" for our organization, so he asked me to look at it.  I knew from experience that this director won't let me in her department to look at anything without prior permission (they're in an outside locked building filled with PII and she's super protective of her stuff), so I called and asked if I could come over and take a look at her printer.  I explained that I wanted to run a few scan tests and have her or one of her people walk me through the process they use.  That's when the conversation went south:

Director, yelling across the phone: ""This is a network issue.  You don't do network issues.  You're not allowed to handle network issues. Do NOT touch the network!""

I was stunned at her words and tone because: 

1. I'm the one in charge of printers.  If something isn't working, I check it out and if I can't handle it, it's moved up to my senior sysadmin and we work on it together so I learn about it.
2. This woman is director of (non-IT-department).  She is equal to my boss, the CIO.  She has no say as to what I can or cannot do or my daily duties, not can she yell at me like that.
3. I'm a freaking SYSADMIN! I'm a Network GOD in my office.

But I played the grown up, told her, ""That's okay, (Director).  I'll speak to (senior sysadmin) and see what is going on.""

I beat her phone call by a minute - just enough time to brief (senior sysadmin) on what was going on.  He was amazed at (director's) attitude. ""You're a sysadmin.  What in the world is she talking about?""

The fun part - her printer problem wasn't a network issue.  The shortcut they're used to pressing on the printer screen had disappeared.  I was able to walk (senior sysadmin) through how to put it back on the printer via our remote system.",1,1629379759

2165,Being the tech support person that other tech support companies call as a last resort,"Back in the day I was the golf pro for several computer stores. I had the latest certificates including being a CNE4. (Novel Netware).  I was called in by one store to go to a large law firm.  The problem was that Canada had instituted the Goods and Services Tax which now covered this industry so their billing software had to be updated to add this new tax field.

The problem was that when you ran the update on the 'Server' the server would get about 80% done then the computer would lock up. 

There were several other techs that had visited this law office and their first idea was run the map command. As it turns out this company was using Novell 1.0.0 so the map command didn't exist. Many techs had left recommending that they update the server and the Netware to at least Novell  3.x, the company before they would even touch this company. As an aside,  I had been to this company many times before to fix machines that didn't boot..  People being people when they were bored would open various files i.e. [command.com](https://command.com) into their word processor (Word Perfect), see that it was apparently junk and then SAVE and close and carry on. This was before recent documents existed. The next morning their computer weld not boot.  A simple boot from floppy and sys c: would fix this problem. This was a small guaranteed income stream  until people stopped looking at things they should not have.. If they had just exited without saving they would have been fine.

&amp;#x200B;

Back to the problem at hand.. Tried the update, same result as everyone else.  Rebooted the Netware Server, contacted the developers of this software, they could not reproduce the fault and this was the only reported problem.

The law office was getting desperate as we all know if you don't bill someone you don't get paid so they were rapidly running out of their line of credit.

Going  back to my home programming skills I recalled where I would occasionally exit twice from a program.  which would unload [command.com](https://command.com).

So I ran [command.com](https://command.com) to load another copy into ram ran the update and it worked to completion.  Ran a few checks and closed out the ticket.

2169,How I quit my first job as tech support,"I quit a gig as tech support after a particular customer where I was called on a Saturday morning because the laptop was completely dead.
Laptop was stationary and I knew the customer was well known for being unreasonably rude as well as willfully ignorant with thech (managed to destroy 2 keyboards within months by ""typing"").
I was woken up by the call and while still trying to figure out where, who and how I was tried to guide the customer trough basic troubleshooting.
Is there any sign of led light being on, fan spinning, hdd spinning, press power button for 5s, is the power brick plugged in, does the power brick feel warm, are all cable connections solid and plugged in? 
All of the questions were answered in the negative in increasingly rude and aggressive manner.
Finally decided to drive there. My hourly rate was 10$ back then... don't ask I was  young desperate and thought the guy I worked for would actually teach me valuable skills in the process. The other catch? I was only being payed for time spent with the customer or on their machines not for traveling.

1,5hrs later I arrived with a full set of tools, equipment, spare powerbrick and even a replacement laptop in case the old one committed Sudoku.
Customer was pissed that I ""took this long"". Again I want to reiterate that it was Saturday now 9am...
After going over the routine checks myself the customer got even more mad claiming ""I allready checked that"" you told me on the phone! ""do something! "" it's all your fault! Etc...
I tried to ignore her (yes, it's exactly what you think the woman was the typical stereotype of a self important Karen).
After 5min I checked the laptop and could not find any signs of life whatsoever so I checked the powerbrick, suprisingly it was plugged in and warm... Then it hit me as I checked the Other side where the cable leading to the laptop was plugged in... Naturally it wasn't!
Cable management was nonexistent under her desk and between 3 PCs and about a quarter ton of paperwork on and under the desk with equal amount of dust she or one of her numerous cats and little kids  that had access to the office must have accidentally unplugged it...

Plugged it back in, laptop works again. 10minutes of work that could have been avoided if the customer actually did what I asked and actually answered my questions truthfully instead of ignoring them and simply saying ""no"" every time...

In the end I received a whopping 10 bucks, spent 3,5 hours of driving, 20$ on gas and the better part of a Saturday on a lose cable.


Needless to say I don't work for this particular company anymore. I did however take over several of his clients that were friendly and respectful and needed continued support. It turned out after he hired me he fired every other tech he had in the area and was now unable to provide service to anyone in half the state...

This particular story was just the last straw in a long line of particularly frustrating assignments including things like being forced to drive 2hrs to a customer to ""install a new wireless keyboard"", driving 3hrs to a customer to install an apple docking station (on a windows laptop...) and ""fix"" a broken mouse at the aforementioned ladys office (aka insert the battery's in the right direction) all the while being only payed for the actual labor not the time spent on the road. 
In the end I did learn valuable lessons but not from my employer....",1,1629303518
2170,End user tries to repair swollen battery… without a new battery,"A little bit of backstory: I work in tier 2 desktop support for a large enterprise and we have a leasing and service contract with one of the larger PC manufacturers.

Basically, one day I’m working on some random virtual machine issue, when I get an escalation from a tier 1 team for a user that has a swollen battery. This model is absolutely notorious for batteries doing this and it’s about 50% of our work orders for these devices, so I assume it’s a run-of-the-mill repair case. I start opening the vendor’s business support site and start creating the case. Little did I know, this case would never be submitted.

The end user comes on the line and we exchange pleasantries, then we get down to business—how bad is the swollen battery, and does he have pictures? He tells me the battery is really swollen, and he tried to fix it, but wasn’t able to. I was quite confused, as you can’t really fix a swollen battery without just replacing it. I ask him to clarify and he begins to clam up and backpeddle a bit, but he knows I’m on to him. I ask him to send a picture of it, and he sends me a picture with the laptop entirely disassembled, and he had removed the battery and put it in rice because he thought that would fix it?

Needless to say, this was definitely a violation of the service agreement and the device was basically written off after that, seeing as he had done quite a number on the hardware.

So, I'm gearing-up for a job interview over Teams, start up the new computer, and... no boot.

I do get a small underscore symbol on the screen after several seconds, but no BIOS or other indication of life.

This is a new system, with a known weak power supply, and the weather has been really hot, so I'm thinking that's probably it. The weird thing is that it was running fine when I shut it down a few days before. I have well over 30 years of computer troubleshooting experience, so I start with the basics first:

Move RAM DIMM #2 to #1 position... no change.

Swap the video card with a low power unit... no change.

Call my friend to see if he has a power supply I can borrow for testing... and he has one! I go get it and it doesn't connect as it's too old (obsolete connectors.)

Interview time, so I grab the 'ole backup laptop and at some point the wireless flakes-out, then the battery dies during the interview with almost no warning. We reschedule for several hours later. Damn, not a good look so far.

Back to the new system troubleshooting... F' it, off to BestBuy to get a replacement power supply.

Get it home, hook it all up, uninstalled, and BINGO! Got Boot! SWEET!

Re-assemble the entire system, turn it on, no boot, same symptom! WHAT?!?!?

Loose connection? Bad wire? WHAT COULD IT BE?

I disconnect everything except for a single monitor, turn it on and... GOT BOOT! HuH?

Then it hits me like a ton of bricks, and I feel so, so, stupid.

What is the very FIRST thing we ask everyone to check when they state that their system suddenly won't boot?

Say it with me now... ""Do you have any USB drives plugged-in?""

Well did I? Yep, sure did! A new bit of software for my Mustang tuning project, arrived a few weeks ago. I had just forgotten that it was there, and since I almost never shut the system down, I never had a boot problem until now.

I guess now I have a more reliable power supply, and a spare!

2174,"expensive parts, but don't send them back to the depot!","Way back in my younger days I was a supervisor for a bunch of remote service techs.   We supported various mini computers, peripherals, printers, data communications equipment, basically anything a customer wanted.  

One of our customers started experiencing intermittent issues with a disk drive.  This was the old days when disk drives were large rack mounted units connected to the disk controller by a couple of cables.  This customer had a bunch of disk drives so there was a whole forest of cables between the two racks.

Our local tech spent two days troubleshooting the problem, slowly replacing interface cards in the disk controller, the disk drives, and various cables.  Finally, after he changed out 3 or 4 cables the problem was solved, but he wasn't sure which cable or cables had been the problem.  

I was talking to him on the phone, now that the problem was solved and we had time to review, and he mentioned that he was bundling up all the parts he had used in troubleshooting to send back to us.

We always did this various logic and interface boards, but cables were expendable.  Conversation went something like this:

Me:  Is there a large trash can near you?

Tech:  Yeah, there's one across the room.

Me:  Gather up ALL the cables and dump them in that trash can.

Tech:  But, aren't they expensive?   Don't you want to test them and see if some are good and go back into stock?

Me:  And what happens when the problem is intermittent, and we test them, and put them back on shelf, and some other tech gets them and they don't work?  And he spends days trying to figure out what's wrong?

Tech:  Oh.  OK, but don't they cost like $100 each?

Me:  Yes.  So what?  What's your time and the customer's uptime worth?

Tech:  Ah, I get it.

2178,A tale of server repair from long ago... (long),"If you don't want a history lesson in what a PITA it was to configure 2-node redundancy 20-some years ago, skip to paragraph 4. 

Today if you want redundancy, it's easy.  You build your Hyper-V/VMware/XenServer/whatever cluster and off you go.  Back in the day, it was considerably more difficult.  In this instance, the year was sometime around 1999 I'd guess.  My client was a very large metropolitan newspaper and specifically the advertising department.  Now, the ad designers all used Macs back then because Photoshop and Illustrator didn't run on anything else.  Corporate IT being corporate IT didn't want anything to do with the Macs, so the advertising department contracted with my company for support.  One of our other guys dealt with the Mac stuff, but I managed the servers.  Now, this is before Apple brought out their short-lived Xserve line and also before Macs really spoke TCP/IP.  They wanted a server that ran on AppleTalk and back then, the way to do that was with Novell Netware running AppleTalk and the Mac namespace on the volumes.  So, we were running Netware 4.11 on Compaq ProLiant 4500Rs.  

The redundancy back then was all hardware.  Essentially, we had two identical servers with local drives that had the operating systems.  Then there were external storage systems with special backplane cards that allowed SCSI connections to each server.  Once each server was set up to boot Netware, they were both configured in BIOS in this redundant configuration with one server (the one plugged into port 1 on each storage system) being the primary and the other secondary.  There was one other piece of hardware to make this work...a serial cable between the two servers.  Once configured, the primary server would boot as normal and mount volumes from the external storage and go on its merry way.  The secondary server would POST, count memory, then immediately go into a loop in POST where it would monitor the primary server.  If it decided that the primary server was not responding, it would send a signal to every storage system connected and a switch on each storage system backplane would operate, switching the connections to the secondary server.  Once that switch was complete, the secondary server would complete POST and come up looking just like the primary server.  You would then repair the primary server.  Unfortunately, the only way to get things back to square 1 with the primary servers working was to power everything off and back on.  

OK, I told you all of that to tell you this.  My newspaper client had this setup and one day, the client's sysadmin calls up to say that the backup server isn't responding.  When it was working properly, it would flash a message every 5 seconds or so to ""press F8 to switch now"" or something where you could manually initiate the failover.  However, it was just hung up on it.  I had him just restart the server and it cleared the problem up.  For a few days.  When it came back, I went out to take a look and ended up doing the standard setting of dipswitch 6 to clear NVRAM that was the first thing support would tell me to do.  That didn't fix the problem as it came back a couple days later.  

I then called support (did you try clearing NVRAM?) and after some diags, we ended up replacing a part (maybe an array controller).  That didn't fix it so we replaced another couple parts.  Of course, each attempt was separated by a few days for the server to hang up again, so eventually I just brought the server back to my office.  By this time, the ticket had been elevated to the highest support group at Compaq.  Over the next several days, we replaced pretty much every major part that could have been replaced and had not resolved the problem.  Finally, my support guy activated the nuclear option.  He sent me one of every single part that went into building the server other than the case.  System board, array controllers, floppy drive, cables, power supplies, power switch...everything.  He had me completely rebuild the entire server all at once from Compaq spare parts.  (in case you're wondering why they didn't just send a new server, this was a discontinued model that my client maintained support on).  After the full rebuild, the server worked fine.  I've said for many years that the worst thing that can happen when you're faced with an issue is that you never fix the problem.  The second worst thing is that you fix the problem, but don't know how or why.  By this point, I was satisfied that it was working and we never had any similar problems.",1,1629174802

Some of the boards are old - about I decade I think - and the newest one was bought earlier this year. They're terribly expensive so it's simply not possible to buy new boards to keep them all at the same the spec.

Now the boards work well for the most part, but from time to time I need to re-calibrate,  re-install a driver, or perform the good old-fashioned ""turn it off and on again"".

Today a teacher called me into her classroom complaining that the board wasn't responding and that her mouse was going crazy. Now as a general rule the first thing I do when I get a ticket from a teacher is to make sure it isn't a user error, and though this teacher is older and less tech-savvy, the board was definitely behaving strangely. I went thought the troubleshooting steps, trying the simplest solution first: is it powered? Yes. Is it communicating with the PC? Yes (most of the boards have an LED to show this). Okay, let's power cycle...still no joy.   
I figured then it might be a driver issue. When I got to the PC, I saw that again teacher wasn't over-reacting: the mouse cursor was bouncing around in the corner like the mouse had been placed on a glass table. So now, before I could reload the drivers for the board, I had to get the mouse working.   
Trying again the simplest and easiest solution first, I re-seated the USB plug. No change. I fetched a spare mouse and plugged it in - still the same.  Different USB port? Nope. So drivers then? I reinstalled the mouse drivers - nothing - and the USB hub drivers - still the same problem. 

It was then that I decided to turn to faithful uncle Google, though I was fairly certain I'd need to replace the PC and have a decent look at this one. The very first link I clicked said something like ""This can happen with touchscreens...blah blah blah...touching the screen..."" and I could kick myself. Before even looking up I knew what I was going to find.  The teacher had placed a display board on the ground in front of the class, with the upper corner touching the lower corner of the whiteboard. All this time the mouse was reacting to the interactive whiteboard, and the board was simply registering the touch of the display board.  I laughed out loud at myself for taking 10 minutes to solve a 10 second issue, and the teacher and children got a good giggle out of it, too.

Saved them travel-time, kept my job even more fun... win-win.

Server was in a room which also included several archives, across the hall from the secretaries of the engineering-department.

At some point, servers crashed. I get a call to check up on it. I arrive at the server-room, and check everything. Everything looks normal. Server restarts, everything is working. The tech-support monitoring stated that server went down due to overheating, but it now runs smoothly again.

Few hours later, same thing happens. Next morning, again. At this point, I've had enough, bring over a spare air-co, set it on cold and close the room. It still didn't help. Around noon, again, server overheating and shutting down. Tech-guy travels all the way to the office and we are both going step by step to figure out what the problem is.

Turned out, she had a nice new coat, and since some things had gone missing before at the desk, she had seen the server-room as the best place to keep it. It was locked after all, and only a handful of people had access to it cause of the archives. There were a few hooks on top of the server, and she found those perfect as a coat-hanger, not realising it blocked airflow to the fans keeping the server cooled.

When the server went down, she couldn't do her regular work, so she would get her coat and go for a walk. Coming back after everythign was running again.

2188,Sometimes we all make mistakes..,"This story comes from a few years ago when I was still working in the law field.

It was right after the Christmas. The office was still pretty empty but there were a few attorneys there. Most of the office took a holiday vacation, coming back after the new year.

I get to work and sit down. I immediately get a call from one of the users sitting directly across from my office. Must have seen me come in I guess. I answer, and they say to me ""Nothing is coming up on my screen."" I guess I don't even get a few seconds to myself before I start my day. Whatever, I could use some coffee anyway.

I head over there and take a look. They look exhausted. They're sitting a their desk, staring at the screen with a dead look and hitting random keys on their keyboard in hopes the screen will come up.

I take one look at them, then look to my left and notice an empty docking station. I calmly pointed to the empty dock and said ""that might be your problem."" They slowly get up and look at the dock, followed by long sigh and a ""God damn it.."" We had a chuckle and I went on my way.

It's Monday, and I didn't want to be there. I decided to not take that extra vacation day so I could make some extra progress on a project. I could have started bitching about them, and how stupid they were. But its early and I had just spent 3 minutes trying to unlock my office door by hitting the ""unlock"" button on my car keys.

At least I had my coffee.",1,1629133026

2190,This is why you always disconnect your tech gear before lightning strikes.,"Hi all! Long time lurker, first time poster. I don't work in tech support, but I am my family's go-to tech support guy, so I have a few stories to tell. TL;DR on the bottom in case you're lazy and don't want to read the entire thing.

So, back in January, I installed a Google Mesh system in my parent's home, so they could have better network coverage in their house as the ISP-provided router wasn't powerful enough to cover the entire house. The Mesh system is of the 2nd gen Google WiFi system (not the newer Nest Wifi stuff).

Now, if you don't know how a mesh network is set up, you have one main router (master) and several access points which kind of acts like the ""slaves"". They all wirelessly connect to each other and provide a stable and reliable connection around the house you set the points up in, as long as you set them up within reasonable range. In our case, we had the master in my dad's office directly connected to the ISP router and two slaves placed in the hallway and in the living room. This system worked perfect and was pretty reliable...  
...up until this story.

One morning I wake up to something like 7 or 8 missed calls from my mom. Apparently that morning, there had been a few powerful lightning strikes in the area where they live, and the power was all out for a while until my dad hooked up the power generator to the house. However, when they got everything back up and running, they noticed there was no network in the house at all. So I started going through all the usual troubleshooting steps I could before I had to go to work (which wasn't really that much). Check everything's connected properly both on the main router and the mesh system. Check if my dad has a wired connection to his desktop. Check our file server for network connection. And finally - reboot absolutely everything. Router, mesh - everything that has to do with the network. Once it all was back up and running again, Still nothing. So I started thinking the main line into the entire village that provides the ADSL network for the village could be shot or maybe a base station. So I checked the ISP status page for any eventual line disconnects or errors - which I found none. So I told my parents to just live off cellular connection as much as possible for the day before I headed to work then we'd look more into it when I got back home.

Later that day, I got a call from my mom and was told that apparently, some techs that work for a contractor company our ISP uses just out of nowhere contacted my dad and told him they would come up to their house and replace their main modem as they had apparently seen some irregularities. How the hell they were able to see that, I have no idea, but I had figured earlier that day that the modem probably was shot since I never saw any errors on the ISP status page. So my dad somehow managed to set up the ISP router himself with the correct settings, and the main network went back up. However, it wasn't really working as it should. 

So, as I said, I installed a Google Mesh system in their house so they would have proper connection all around the house. However, from that morning, the Mesh network didn't work at all. They asked me a few times throughout the week what the issue could be but the little troubleshooting I was able to do earlier in the week never really told me anything. We checked connections, rebooted.. Nothing worked.

For information - I live 5 hours away from my parents by car, and I don't have a car, so it wasn't really an option to get to their house and do the troubleshooting myself, so this all had to be done over the phone which is hard enough when you work with IT-competent people, but even harder when you talk with someone who doesn't really know much more than the basics to operate their computer and smartphone on a day to day basis.

So this morning, we went haywire on getting the mesh network back up and running as well as figuring out what in the fuck actually brought it down in the first place.

The first thing we did was the usual text book stuff. Reboot, check connections. All that simple stuff. After all that was done and we still were stuck with the same result, it hit me. Every router has some sort of status LED that lights up in all kinds of colours to indicate the status of the router. In the case of these Google WiFi points, it's the following:  
\- White for Everything's okay  
\- Blinking blue for both working and ready for setup  
\- Solid blue for factory reset in progress  
\- Blinking Orange for No Connection  
\- Blinking Red for when something's wrong with the router  
This hit me way too late so out of nowhere, I pulled up the Google Support page that shows what the colors mean before I ask my dad ""What color is the front LED on the router?"". To my unexpected surprise, I get back ""Umm... It's blinking Orange.."" At this point, I just smashed my head in the desk and immediately had an idea of what the issue could be. So I immediately told my dad to go downstairs and grab one of the two Mesh points I had put there and bring it upstairs. After five minutes, we had a new point upstairs in my dad's office connected and powering on. Wouldn't you guess it - It got a connection right away. It also was 10x quicker at starting up. This immediately confirmed my suspicion.

What had happened was the lightning that fried our main router, also managed to fry parts of the motherboard in the Google Wifi point that was directly connected to the router with a cable. Therefore, the ethernet in port was fried and the router didn't receive any network signal in. So what we had to do was reset the entire mesh network, set up one of the other routers as the master router and the two others as slaves again in the same positions and voila, it all was up and running again.

Now, even tho we got it all back up and running, I have set up a warranty case with Google to see if we can get this replaced. But until then, the partially dead point serves as the hallway mesh point. 

So moral of the story - if you know there's gonna be any sort of lightning in your area, please make sure to disconnect any network equipment that is critical and could be killed easily if lightning strikes.

TL;DR: Parents left network equipment connected during some lightning in their area - ends up with little to no network for about a week.",1,1629063402

2192,The 5 lady,"  

TW for mention of “killing herself”

I have many stories from my years of tech support, but nothing else quite like this. So, many years ago, I worked for a big box tech retailer in Canada which later got taken over by an American company, but at the time it had a different name which we’ll refer to as “Loser shop”. This was my first official tech job ever and I was maybe only a few weeks in. I didn’t see this first interaction, but I was told about it in great detail after the fact. One day, we had a lady come in looking for a computer, a normal occurrence, but this time was very different. She walked in with a crystal on a string and started “divining” the laptops to find the right one. One thing to know about this lady is she was terrified…TERRIFIED…of the number 5. No that’s not a joke. After she found just the right laptop, they had to sort through every single one until they located one without the number 5 in the serial number. The final total couldn’t have a 5 in it….you get the idea. From here on in we’ll refer to her as 5 lady. One day I’m in the tech room and I get a call. It was a few years ago so dialogue might not be exact, but it’s pretty close.  
 

Me: Loser shop tech room, how can I help you?  
 5 lady: \*SCREAM!!! Crying sounds\*  
 Me: \*holding phone away from my ear\* um…ma’am, what-  
 5 lady: \*more screaming and incoherent sobbing\* FIVE! THERE’S A FIVE!!!  
 me: \*kinda freaked out at this point\* ma’am, can you tell me-  
 5 lady: MY DESKTOP DISAPPEARED AND NOW THERE’S 5S EVERYWHERE!!! \*more screaming and sobbing\*  
 me: \*really really freaked out now\* ma’am what-  
 5 lady: I’M GONNA KILL MYSELF THERE’S 5S!!! I CAN’T HAVE 5S!!! I SPENT HOURS MAKING ALL THE DESKTOP ICONS SO THEY DIDN’T HAVE 5S IN THE TIMESTAMP AND NOW THEY’RE GONE!! I’M GONNA KILL MYSELF!!!  
 me: \*kinda shaking at this point but I think I know what’s happened\* ok, I think I know-  
 5 lady: \*screams again at the top of her lungs\* I’M GONNA KILL MYSELF! I’M GONNA KILL MYSELF! \*more scream crying\*  
 me: \*cannot handle this anymore and am now shaking and don’t know what to do\*  
 

At this point my co-worker finally took pity on me and mercifully took the phone from me. Somehow he managed to walk her through fixing it when she wouldn’t let me get a word in edgewise. Possibly the most traumatic experience of my whole tech career. I will never forget this experience. It may have only lasted a couple minutes, but it felt like hours. Pretty sure it shaved a few years off my life.",1,1629050096

2195,Boss Installed a New Timecard System Without Telling Me,"This is my second post here and again, I'm not Tech Support, but I was ""that guy"" who had to handle everything tech related *before* we bothered to call (and pay for) our actual Tech Support vendor, who was an old friend of the owner and while his service was top-notch, we were his smallest client and his working for us was a personal favor, so we tried not to bother him....

....anyway I was also the Office Manager and the owner/boss blindly bought some new software to put on everybody's computer to ""make it easier"" for our 10 employees to log in their start and stop times for the day. Evidently using a simple Excel sheet wasn't easy enough that he had to spend about a grand on this program for every computer. Ends up he didn't run it by me or by our Tech Support guy before purchasing this software. I expressed my concerns, well mostly about how this wasn't really needed with such a small office, but evidently the owner was concerned that his employees might be ""fudging their timecards"" and this was the magic fix. Again, I thought it was a bit of overkill for such a small office. These programs ran on individual computers and not on our server, which got me thinking.....

I logged into my computer, looked at the time clock and clocked in using the new software. Then I just changed my computer's clock time and sure enough, I could clock out showing I had worked eight hours! A few minutes later and I already had my 40 hours done for the week and I hadn't even had my Morning coffee! I printed off my timecard and handed it to the boss and told him I'd see him next week.

Of course I didn't actually leave, but I did manage to get him to have our Tech Support remove the software and get a refund....",1,1628908175
2196,User desperately needs access to VPN,"A couple weeks ago my inbox notification went off and I dutifully checked my email. Someone had sent an email to all IT administrators in my company. This person's email went roughly like this, ""I have been emailing the helpdesk for 2 weeks now that I need access to the VPN and no one has helped me. Can you please help?!"" the person's boss was also CCed in this email.  


My Teams notification suddenly goes off and it is the CCed boss asking me to please call her as her employee needs VPN assistance and it is very important that this employee has access as soon as possible.

I am not the helpdesk tech. I am the systems admin. I decide to ignore the boss for now and I log into the helpdesk to see what is going on. I do a search for the user....no open tickets. I refine the search for any tickets ever from this user....no tickets. None open, none closed, none pending. Nothing. This user has never emailed the helpdesk.

I still want to help, and I know the helpdesk tech is a busy person so I email the user and CC the boss. My email says roughly this, ""Hey user. I checked the ticket system and I didn't see any tickets, so I want to make sure you are emailing [helpdesk@company.com](mailto:helpdesk@company.com). Regardless, let me help you get set up. So we are in the process of switching to a new VPN system. I've created an MFA account for you and you should have an email from the MFA system in your inbox now. Please follow the steps it prompts to complete step 1 of the new VPN. You'll need to download the CISCO client and configure that as well. We don't have instructions written for that yet, so please call me at 555-1122 or reply to this email and I can schedule a meeting with you and I'll be glad to walk you through the process of completing the setup. Warmest regards.""

The rest of the day goes by. No email, no phone call from the user. I checked in the admin section of the MFA software and saw that the user had completed the setup and had configured a phone number. Alright, great! They've completed step 1. Now they just need to call me and I can get them the CISCO VPN software, provide them the URL and help them get into the VPN. They just need to contact me with an ideal time for them.

One week later.....

I get an automated email alert that the user has locked themselves out of the MFA for too many bad authentications.

Another week has gone by and I still have not gotten a call or an email from the user. They still have not emailed the helpdesk at all. I check up on it every couple days. Maybe someday they will finish reading my email and follow my directions. Maybe not. But I'm not chasing them down. I'm curious to see how long it will take. In the meantime they still do not have access to the VPN. I wonder how they are doing their job.",1,1628904073

2200,Exceeding expectations by delivering features late,"Another software dev here. Our support people got a request from a business we work with to add a specific feature. It wasn't a simple request.

&gt; ProductOwner: No pressure FinalDevice, but we need to give them an estimate. When do you think it'll be done?

&gt; Me: About 2 months.

Time comes and goes. Feature gets built. It's annoying to test and I made bugs. Feature gets fixed. It's still annoying to test, but there are fewer bugs. Do more fixing. After roughly 2 1/2 months, we deliver the feature. It's a couple weeks late, but I work for a chill company (and the feature request was from a chill client). I figured they'd care more than it works correctly than that it arrives on time.

&gt; BossPerson: Hey FinalDevice, I've been meaning to say thank you! The client is thrilled that you shipped the feature so quickly.

&gt; Me: Awesome, glad they're happy! We missed our estimate though, I'm surprised they thought that was fast.

&gt; BossPerson: Missed? I'm pretty sure we told them 6 months...

Apparently when I told ProductOwner it would take 2 months, she padded it and promised the feature in 3 months. This message was passed to ProjectManager, who padded the estimate and promised the feature in 4 months. This message was passed to BusinessRelationsManager, who padded the estimate and promised the client that we'd deliver in 6 months. At each stage they assumed that whatever estimate they received was probably optimistic (to be fair, I missed my original estimate) and should be padded ""just in case"".

It's just funny because it's the exact opposite of the usual horror story. Most companies you say ""6 months"" and each manager whittles the number down a bit in hopes that it makes them look good.",1,1628868662

2203,20 mile line of sight,"Disclaimer: I am not a support technician. My parents happen to be the user in this story. Forgive me if any details are wrong.

When I was in high school, my parents decided to build a new house. We lived in a century-old farmhouse, 5 miles from the nearest town, and had line of sight internet. The internet wasn't great, but it was enough for email and online classes.

In order to build the new house, we bulldozed the old house and moved to a town about 20 miles away for a summer. My parents, knowing nothing about technology, took the router and sundry with them. They ended up putting the router in my 2nd floor bedroom window because it was the only way they could get the Wi-Fi to work.

Shortly after we moved, we noticed the internet quality and speed dropping. I was taking a online college course at the time, so we really needed to get it fixed. My mom called the line of sight internet provider and ask them to come check the router. They asked for an address. She gave it. 

When the technician arrived, he took one look at the router and said, ""Ma'am, I'm sorry to tell you this, but you will be losing your internet service. Your little setup here has been dragging down our entire system and baffling our team. You can have your service back when you return to your original address.""

2207,The user who restarted too... much,"Today, one of my users had a problem with getting QuickBooks to open a company file over the network, so I went down to her desk. I have no clue what QuickBooks was having problems with, because I just clicked ""open"" and the QB login screen showed up. I start to leave.

At this point, the user mentioned that she has been restarting her computer three or four times a day. (I have problems getting some users to restart once a week.) I asked her why. She said that it was because her dual monitors never came back up correctly when the computer went to sleep. One of them would always be blank, and the desktop icons would end up on the other monitor. In other words, standard Windows difficulties keeping track of a second display.

She thought it was normal to have to restart a computer this often, because it was about 5-7 years old. I told her that no, it is not normal to have to reboot this often, regardless of PC age. I disabled automatic sleep to prevent this from happening in the future, and she was quite happy that she wouldn't have to restart so often.

2208,these processors are TOO good,"Kind of long, apologies if its too boring.

Many years ago I was service tech for an automation company.  We sold complete solutions including all hardware and software for large installations, most of these were multiple branch situations, connected via leased phone lines, back when the internet wasn't a thing.

One of the guys I worked with was from Russia and one of the smartest people I've ever worked with.  His experience in computers involved having to rebuild most systems at a customer's site since the factory just shipped stuff out to make their quotas, no one cared if it worked.  So he was an excellent troubleshooter, down to the component level.  He was our in house tech support guru, let's call him Ivan. 

Some of the items we sold with our systems were computer terminals, which were manufactured by another vendor.  And they frankly were not that great.  My company was in the process of spinning up our own ability to manufacture a new line of terminals but two large sales came up before we were ready, so our old vendor was tasked to build an intermediate model, better than the old ones, not as good as our new and improved models would be.  So they built around 150-200 units, half were installed for a customer in California and half went to a customer in the Eastern US.

We started to get reports of erratic behavior from both customers, basically the display would get scrambled and the terminal had to be be reset (soft reset) but it cleared any work in progress so the customer had to re-enter what they were doing.  We figured out that static electricity was a common cause, a user would walk across some carpet, touch the terminal, and the display would scramble. Sometimes it would happen without anyone touching it at all. 

We kicked this problem back to the vendor and sent some of problem units to them.  They also sent one of their QA techs to the customer's site to see if he could figure it out.  We also sent a couple of units to our engineering group at our manufacturing center.  So, lots of people were working on the problem but no one was working very hard.  The vendor knew we would not be buying anymore terminals from them, so they kind of went through the motions.  Our engineering folks had many problems they were working on, and they knew that we would not have any more of this model coming online so they were not too invested in the problem either.

The customer was really unhappy with how long things were dragging on (months) and was complaining to the sales team, who was complaining to my boss, who was the service manager for the Western US.  He called Ivan and me in and said he wanted us to solve the problem, forget about everyone else who was working on it.  Overtime was authorized for us to work after hours.

Ivan knew way more about digital circuits than I did, but I was around as an assistant.   That evening we pulled one of the units apart so the logic board was exposed but the unit was powered up.  We found we could force the problem by simply touching the microprocessor chip with a metal tool or even a finger (running it along the leads).   We could not believe that an entire load of chips was defective so Ivan was poking around and got the idea that maybe the chip was getting dirty power.  We had an oscilloscope handy and he checked for ripple on the power lead for the the chip, and it looked fine.  However Ivan realized the voltage looked wrong, it should be 5 volts, (I couldn't tell from scale we were using), so we grab a DVM and check the voltage, and its about 4.5 volts.  

Ivan grabbed a catalog we had and looked up the chip, it required 5 volts plus or minus .25 volts, so the power was out of spec.  But the terminal still worked at 95% of the time.  He started checking voltages where the supply connected to the logic board, it was around 4.95 volts.  The power supply was in an external brick, which we opened up and found 5.05 volts (I think, this was almost 40 years ago).  The brick was connected to the terminal by a 6 foot multiple lead cable.  

I was thinking how terrible this was, I had no idea how were going to fix it.  I'm guessing the vendor is going to have to rebuild all the power supplies, or we are.  Ivan just held up a hand and continued reading the catalog and looking into the power supply.  He then announces that the 5 volts is supplied by a specific regulator in the power supply, and the company makes a 6 volt regulator in an identical case, and we'll just swap it and see what happens.  

Next day we went to a local supplier and bought a couple of the 6 volt regulators, rushed back to the office and swapped out the 5 volt for a 6.  The regulator was not even soldered in, it used a socket.  We powered the terminal up and started checking voltages.  We had at least 5 volts everywhere and the terminal display was stable now.  We had another terminal so we did the same thing for it and found it was stable also.  

We wrote up our findings and sent them off to our engineering team.  In the mean time we bought enough 6 volt regulators to upgrade all our customer's units.  We told our local tech to just start changing out the regulators on an ""as needed"" basis and to put a colored sticky dot on each power supply he upgraded.

Then we got a whole bunch of stuff from our engineering team.  They had created a Field Change Order, complete with components, diagrams, forms, and wanted us to use this instead.  We figured their fix would take over an hour per unit to upgrade, ours would take five minutes.  They had included additional wiring to make the voltage adjustable on a unit by unit basis.  Ivan and I talked it over with our boss and decided we'd just proceed with our easy fix and hope no one followed up with us.  

Ivan pointed out that the real problem was the chips were ""too good"".  If they had really required the specified voltage, the problem would have been discovered by the manufacturer and solved before the terminals left the factory.  Of course he was joking, but it was ""kind of"" true.  

Some weeks later I was a party where one of the engineers that worked for terminal manufacturer happened to be.  He and I knew each other pretty well, and I knew he had been one of the team that designed the problem terminal.   I was describing what we had found and how we had fixed it, and he kind leaned back in his seat and rolled his eyes.  I asked him what the problem was and he told me that the original design called for the power supply to be internal to the terminal, so there would not be a 6 foot power lead.  So maybe, everything would have been okay if they hadn't switched to the external brick, which was done since they wanted to use a slimmer case for the terminal.  

At the end of the day the customer was happy, the sales team was happy, and we were happy.  And I got lesson in perfect being the enemy of good enough.",1,1628716795
2209,Inside the mind of The Boomer user,"This is not so much a tale about my personal experience, but I just read an article in a local paper about a new ticket system for sporting events and thought it granted a great look into the mind of The Boomer. 

[Link to article here,](https://www.statecollege.com/penn-state-should-rethink-football-mobile-ticketing-policy/) basically it is about how this year there will be digital tickets only and the person writing the article is going through the steps on how to get tickets set up on their phone. As they are a boomer the logic makes no sense and I will share some of the highlights below.

So the article starts with *The Boomer* getting an email about how they will get their ticket through their phone.
&gt; The email says I need an iPhone or Android phone to access my tickets. Except I have a Samsung phone. I know it’s not an iPhone but I don’t have any idea whether it’s an Android or not. So I go into the “Settings” menu and scroll down to the “About phone” section and touch that. The screen that opens says it’s a Samsung SM-J327V phone. It shows my phone number, serial number and other details but doesn’t mention anything about an Android. 

As The Boomer begins to struggle with what should be an assumption that they have an Android phone, *The Boomer* reaches out for help

&gt; So now I turn to the internet. I open a search engine and type “Is a Samsung SM-J327V phone an Android phone?” The first item the search returns is from a website named PhoneMore.com. As I am always wary of websites I’ve never heard of, I go to the second option which is Samsung’s own website with a link to my specific model phone. Surely I’ll find answers there. I search through the manual online. I search through the full specs online. Nothing.

&gt;Not thrilled with the first option but feeling confident that my Norton Security software will stop any malicious attacks, I go back to the first link on the search results and click it. Partway down the page I see this review of my phone, “Good Android phone…” Well, it’s a nameless website, but it’s the best information I’ve got to go on, so let’s hope they are right and that I do have a phone compatible with this new ticketing process. 

Now that *The Boomer* has confirmed they have the technology needed, they go on to talk about how the digital tickets are supposed to be safer, easier, and reduce ticket theft and counterfeiting and how they feel like they are none of the above. *The Boomer* then goes on to meet the biggest obstacle any boomer can face.... downloading an app. 

But first they need to watch a Video on how to do that.

&gt;The email then goes on to have me click a video link to learn about the key steps in this process. Which I studiously click only to find myself staring at the toes of an individual suffering from severe toenail fungus. Luckily I’m able to “Skip Ad” after a few seconds and get to the important stuff.

Ok now we can download that app from the app store right. No problem.

&gt;Uh oh. The first thing I learn is that I have to download a mobile app. The Official Penn State Athletics Mobile App to be precise. “Oh boy, here we go,” I think to myself. 

I said the same thing in my head while reading this. 

&gt;So I open up the app window on my phone and click on Galaxy Store. I make sure I’m in the App mode (not Games) and click on the Search icon in the upper right. I type (one letter at a time with my large fingers) “Penn State Athletics Mobile App”, and click the search icon. Several options pop up – the first is Penn State Nittany Lions Official Text Stickers. The next is Penn State Nittany Lions Official Photo Stickers. Then it’s Florida State Seminoles Official Text Stickers. As I scroll down the options… Grambling State, Mississippi State, Kansas State, and on and on, it’s clear there is no Penn State Athletics Mobile App as a choice. 

&gt;Undeterred, I close the window, and look for another option to add an app. I find that if I open the Samsung window, I can click the Add Apps icon at the bottom of that screen. This time I only type “Penn State Athletics Mobile” because I’m limited to only 30 characters. I click Go and get “No results found.” I try “Penn State Athletics” and again get no results. After five minutes of trying several options I realize the search function is only looking through apps I already have installed. Clearly I’ll need to do some internet searching on how to add apps to my phone as I’m having little success. But we’ll deal with that later as at this point I’m only 35 seconds into a 90 second video. Who knows, maybe the video will have some clues on how to get the app.

At this point I am both impressed and have a headache at the mental gymnastics *The Boomer* has gone through to download this app. I do see the path they were trying to follow but I would think with a video to guide them the steps should have been pretty easy to follow. 

Now they essentially give up on downloading the app and move on to the next step which is downloading Google Pay to access the ticket which they wouldn't be able to do because they haven't downloaded the app. now *The Boomer* goes on to talk about how to set up Google Pay they need to have a passcode on their phone which is the worst thing you could ask someone to do.

&gt;I go back to the email and read further. Bullet point No. 2 also states that my smartphone needs to have a passcode or FaceID installed for my mobile wallet to work. Neither of which I have on my phone. I like using my smartphone to do many things – call, text and email. I don’t need to install a passcode or FaceID on my phone to do those things nor do I want to. When I’m ready to use my phone I pick it up and use it. Why is Penn State forcing me to make my life more difficult?

I feel for The Boomer at this point and I can tell that they are struggling and will most likely just hold up the line at the football game and make getting in more of a nightmare than it already is. But it is 2021 and I feel like these are all basic things for the average person at this point. 

The rest of the article goes on to talk about how the process is difficult, and how people without smartphones will be affected negatively, and how as a business they need to cater to there customers better. I do get the point they are making and do agree that paper tickets should be easily gotten but this article was just funny to me as it provides what I believe to be a great insight into what the average users thought process looks like. I hope you enjoyed these tales from inside the mind of *The Boomer*.",1,1628690576
2210,Another death march software development project with no specification with abusive management,"This will be a long post. No way I can fit all the interesting bits in a less screen space than this.

&amp;#x200B;

After having been let go on the previous employment, I quickly found what at the time seemed to be a nice new job at a semi-small IT company (30-50 employees).

The interview went ok, I asked whether there was any overtime required, and was told that **there was no overtime, no-one does overtime**.

I joined a team as an architect/principal engineer and was tasked to create a brand new .net core 3.0 application, since such things are exactly my cup of tea I had the entire ""schematic"" of the target system done ahead of schedule (*simply because of very solid previous experience*).

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**The analysis**

The app that we needed to build (lets call it ""**Fail v3**"" included several third party integrations, one of which was ""**Integration Funtastic**"", at one point in my career I had actually worked for the company that designed ""Funtastic"" and I was (partly) working on ""Funtastic"" itself, therefore I had a lot of insight on how much time that particular integration would take. 

I had noted (in the plan I had designed) that this particular integration could take **3-4 months on its own**.

Next step in the process, after having analyzed the domain, was task **planning** and task **estimation** (*the process where you enter all the tasks in JIRA (or some other tool) and assign a ""value"" (a difficulty or manhours needed) to each task*). 

This helps project management **forecast** when a certain functionality **may be expected** to be delivered (*and to control priorities*).

Actually there is no such thing as a deadline in agile, agile is all about re-iterative reassessment, reprioritization and learning as you go.

This particular step was suddenly delayed, this got me a bit worried, because usually when a company ignores estimates/prioritization it means that the already have a ""hard deadline"" in mind so they don't care at all about how long it would **actually** take the developers to create it, the devs are expected to ""**crunch**"" on demand.

&amp;#x200B;

**The story of app codename ""Fail v3""**

This particular application already had a **predecessor** app (let us call it ""**Fail v2**"") that was already in production (*but was not working properly*), each year this predecessor app was in trouble as there was an annual hyper-influx of users (*the domain dictated the rhythm of usage*) and so, every year, all hell broke loose. 

Developers usually had to correct data by directly manipulating the SQL store. 

The core issues that brought about such corruption of data were never addressed (cost concerns - **it was more cost effective to charge the client for maintenance than to simply fix the bugs**).

The predecessor apps were designed in their entirety by students (*cheapest labor force available*).

It was exactly the time of year when the old application usually begins receiving 50-ish tickets per day and so I was told to split my attention between designing the new version of that app (Fail v3), and maintaining the old one (Fail v2). 

The Fail v2 app was entirely fracked up, there were logical errors on pretty much every single line of code, realistically speaking it should have been thrown away a long time ago. 

There was no documentation, no specification, and, as I started working on it, no-one present at the company at that time knew where it had been deployed (which servers), nor how to log in to the data store and/or the linux servers (docker machines, metal) so **everything had to be reverse engineered**.

Your standard clusterf\*ck with projects run by clueless managers.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Students to the rescue**

The above describer situation is what you usually get when you hire students as you main workforce.

 The company owner is a professor at a local university so what he regularly did was take the most naïve students, offer them a paid ""internship"" at his company **BUT** later on made them pay the internship back (in cash, no trace).

As a student received his stipend, he gave a portion of it to the owner, cash. 

A pretty neat side-hustle.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**The ""specification""**

The specification for all iterations of this application was created by the same person, the **head business analyst/project manager, a seasoned veteran with over 20 years of managerial experience**, who had been working on this particular domain, exclusively, for more than **3 years** (*and still didn't know what the app needed to do*). 

The specification was (*yet again, third time*) completely wrong and we were soon changing core features on a daily basis.

The ""Fail v3"" team was comprised of **two students** (*who had never done any programming before that point in time*), a **single intermediate frontend** dev, and a **senior backend** dev, and obviously me as an architect -&gt; who was also assigned to provide support to the ""Fail v2"" application.

""We are paying you a lot of money therefore, we fully expect that a senior dev of your stature is able to manage all that we have assigned to you"" they said.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**The project kickoff**

As the actual work on the project was about to begin (*as I mentioned before, there was already a delay between the completion of domain analysis and kickoff*) - I was allocated to two **additional** projects that would otherwise most likely fail (*simply put, I was the only true senior at the company at the time that could manage higher order of difficulty*). 

Immediately I wrote a warning email to the CEO, COO, CTO and PMs (I had several PMs at that moment) detailing why I would not be able to invest 110% effort on each of the 6 different initiatives and I officially asked for **immediate re-prioritization of initiatives**.

Simply put, I wanted somebody to decide (and take responsibility) which initiatives were to become ""priority victims"" -&gt; because not everything could be done with the at that time available resources.

This was blatantly ignored, entirely. 

I kind of expected for this to happen, **management will always avoid setting priorities simply to avoid the aftermath if their choice proved to be wrong.**

Finally, several months after the initial analysis, and now mere **5 months away from the hard deadline** the actual work on the new version of the app started.

So there we were, attending a 1 hour long kickoff/planning session. 

The PM laid out an **excel sheet** (*he started ignoring JIRA from the very start of the project, and this is one other ""clue"" that tells that the company intends to play it dirty*) that detailed the work chunks that needed to be completed. 

I started providing the estimates for each item/task, and the PM was patient enough to listen to the estimates, near at the end of the meeting it had became apparent t that if we were to take into account the estimates that I had just given, we would be \~ **9 months short of dev time**, so he simply said:

""Ok, you will need to do all the required work in the following 5 months, otherwise there will be hell to pay, the meeting is done, we have come to an agreement, you have given me a promise, now you will deliver"".

Immediately all alarms in my head were ringing really loud, but before I started looking for a new job I wanted to confirm whether I heard him right, so I said:

""Wait, lets recapitulate, the devs have given their estimates, and you've ignored the estimates, cutting the time needed to finish the project in less than half, which means the 3 of us (I didn't count the students) now need to work **16 hours per day, 7 days a week** to **PERHAPS** meet the deadline the management has set, and you knew about all of this almost **a year ago,** but decided that there were **other so called priorities that needed to be resolved before this**?""

""Exactly, you're being paid adequately for this project to succeed in the allotted time period and with the allotted resources, and I don't like your attitude towards work. We are running a **serious** business here, **we all have deadlines**, and we all do **whatever is needed to meet them**, you need to do that as well, you will make do with the resources you have and in the time frame we are giving you, or else measures will be taken to correct the issue, furthermore your **ATTITUDE** towards work has been noted, you must not hide form work behind agile methodology, you need to **GET TO WORK**""

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Paid overtime**

""Ok...fair enough (*not fair at all, I decided I would resign ASAP, but would not tell them until I was in a good position to effortlessly switch jobs*) so lets go over one final thing before we begin work - how do you want the **overtime** to be tracked? excel? JIRA?""

The manager was extremely irritated at this point, he said:

""What overtime?""

""We are obviously going to be crunching in order to meet the deadline, and the extra hours need to be paid.""

So the PM tells me:

""You're acting as if you had never worked in IT before, as a so called seasoned expert you must have learned by now the overtime is not paid, if you aren't qualified for the tasks and need extra time to complete them, that's your problem, if you think you need to work double shifts to get the work done, that's **YOUR** problem, you cant charge the company for your **inadequacies**, we are paying you as an **expert developer**"".

""Ok, so excel it is."" I said..

(*from that moment on I was tracking every single hour of overtime and sending the total sum both to the PM and to the owner, this was routinely* ***COMPLETELY*** *ignored, they kept acting as if the mails did not exist*).

Their tactic concerning overtime was to pretend that you (as a dev) need to **notify them first, before doing any overtime**, and then they either approve of this extra cost, or don't approve.

At the same time they use **threats** and **artificially imposed deadlines** to make you work overtime.

Most people ended up immediately working overtime, and then when they would ask for approval post-facto, the request would be denied, hence they never got paid.

The previous team (*that had worked on the ""Fail v2""*) had all resigned due to immense number of overtime they had to endure, all without getting paid. 

At that moment everything was clear.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Looking for a clean exit**

I was looking for a new job at this point and have already passed all the interview steps with a company that I had worked with in the past, and so I was getting ready to resign and avoid this **monumental death march that the management had in mind for the dev team (AGAIN)**. 

That's when I learned that the company I wanted to move to had current business relations with my current employee and that the owner had vetoed my potential job switch - and that the owner had also made sure the HR at the other company knew that I was an extremely problematic employee, exquisitely insubordinate, disloyal and extremely difficult to manage.

Therefore my ""exit"" had been blocked, and additionally - any further chances with the company I applied to were effectively annihilated.

That's when I contacted my lawyer and begun keeping a **journal of all the mobbing** I was to endure later on.

Because now they knew I was ready to resign, the mobbing had taken an entirely new dimension, I was moved to a room **away from the team**, the leadership role was taken away from me and given to the senior developer I was mentoring until that point, and I have been given the worst tasks they could find.

The PM begun regularly screaming at me, I could hear him coming down the hallway, already yelling, he would then slam open the door and usually open up with ""**WHAT are you currently working on, and is it DONE?!**""

To this I would take my journal of mobbing and start writing down what was being said, I replied ""as the **project manager**, shouldn't **you** know what I am working on? furthermore, all the task statuses are publicly visible to everyone, including yourself, via JIRA, you can check the statuses there.""

""I don't give a f\*ck about JIRA, you're going to report to me when I want you to report to me, and in the way I want you to report to me, I don't have time for JIRA.""

""Fair enough, I will create a meeting sub task in JIRA so we can track time I spend on this reporting.""

""I don't care, write anything you want, as long as you deliver on time, we are paying you to deliver, so **deliver**.""

A colleague of mine was in pretty much the same predicament (*on another project that he inherited from me*), but he was being threatened by the owner by **legal action** if he didn't considerably up his work efforts, so the guy told the owner:

""My wife is pregnant and I need to be home on time to help her.""

to this the owner replied:

""You need to **discipline your wife**, she can handle the house and the kids, mine does, so can yours, organize your life so you can input adequate work, **we are all serious people here, act seriously.**""

I knew therefore that at some point they would threaten me with legal action as well, but I also knew this would be a bluff, they're strategically fearmongering people into submission, in order to ensure they work double shifts.

They had the entire charade planned from the beginning. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**The escalation**

At one point the situation had really escalated, nearing the deadline my team was working 20hrs per day (*and I was not, I admit -&gt; I was sufficiently pissed off that I did \*EXACTLY\* 8 hrs of work for them and then went offline*), so they tried calling in on me at 20:30 to check if I was indeed working, naturally I did not answer the phone, so I was immediately greeted by an angry email that said (among other things):

""...you are being paid fairly to deliver what you yourself **promised** you would deliver, we do not wish to play the cat and mouse game with you, you will fall in line and work or you will face the consequences, your requests for paid overtime have been denied **because you haven't asked anyone for the approval to begin working overtime**""

so I replied:

""Please find attached the email from a couple of month ago where I warned you that it would not be possible to work on 6 project simultaneously with impossible deadlines on each of them, and without specifications for any of them. Since the warnings had been ignored I do not plan to input any extra effort into this.""

...

""I thought all the previous threats you have made meant you were quite aware overtime hours are happening, I have also been sending reports on overtime hours, weekly, for 2 months now.""

""We have not received any reports, and we have never approved any overtime, sorry.""

""Then I will simply stop working overtime.""

""As long as you deliver on promise, you can stop working overtime. Its fine by us.""

As you can see, they had the MO pretty well thought of, they shoved the ""**promise of delivery**"" down your throat, and then **held you accountable** to that promise, if you didn't deliver on time, you had an option to work overtime to correct your own failings, and (normally) the company would **not** pay for this because its your own fault that you weren't sufficiently qualified to complete your work on time.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**The Funtastic meeting**

Remember when earlier I mentioned the so called ""Funtastic"" integration? 

To reiterate, I had given the PM/PA all the information he needed (and more) regarding the ""Funtastic"" integration during the analysis phase -&gt; because I knew a lot of the details on it, having previously been employed at ""Funtastic"".

Therefore, the PM/PA was EXTREMELY aware of how much work needed to be done in regards to the ""Funtastic"".

One day, we went to visit the company that made the ""Funtastic"" (*the Funtastic app is, in itself, a monument to how things can go* ***horribly horribly*** *wrong when a company decides to create their own* ***domain specific language***) and so there we were, sitting at the conference table alongside the representatives of the ""Funtastic"" company, and they were giving us info on what exactly we needed to deliver in less than **2 months time**.

Remember that my original estimate for ""Funtastic"" integration was **3-4 months**.

Also take into consideration that at the time I was also working on ""Fail v2"", and 4 other **critical** projects.

The PM/PO was ""staggered/shocked"" with the information he heard on that meeting (*he is good at pretending*) and on our way back to the company HQ he served us the **fairy tale** of how we just got ""fracked"" by our business partner, and delivered the bad news:

""Unfortunately, due to circumstances completely out of my control, and completely due to how badly our business partner had communicated how complex their software was, we have no other choice but to expect you to crunch for a while so we hit the delivery due date.""

So I was like: ""You were, in fact, given the information on how long this integration would take several months ago, so this could not have been a surprise for you. This is what we shall do, we shall add the stories pertaining to ""Funtastic"" to the backlog and simply follow agile methodology from there.""

""We cant do that - we will never deliver in time if we do it like that.""

""Yes, and you knew that fact several months ago.""

""Don't talk crap, I will not listen to this useless crap, give me solutions don't simply keep listing problems! We are paying you to **solve problems in \*your\* domain as we do in ours.**""

""Well, a month before deadline the specification you produced, which is entirely your domain, does not include 30% of the volume of work needed to be done, and you WERE officially warned about the lack of an entire (""Funtastic"") integration.""

""Don't talk to me about the specification! I don't want to hear ANYTHING about the specification any more. Quit blaming the specification for your own laziness. Just get to work and everything will be fine!""

""That's the **third** iteration of the very same specification, your department had been working on this for **\~3 years** yet still the specification is missing entire sections, in addition to being blatantly wrong in pretty much every other section.""

Needless to say he was **extremely** pissed off, so much that nearing the end of my employment there, he would say: 

""I don't care what he is working on and whether he has delivered anything, I don't care, I don't want to talk to him, don't wanna hear anything about him.""

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**The aftermath**

Since I have actually delivered everything that needed to be delivered (**but not without friction, obviously**), with **tremendous** help from my teammates -&gt; who did (*to their own misfortune*) input \***thousands\* of hours of unpaid overtime**, the situation calmed down substantially. 

The PM admitted at one point that the project was ""over the budget"" and ""over the initial plan"" for as much as 6000 manhours.

This means the project was delivered with **3000** paid hours and **6000 additional** unpaid hours (*probably more*), this only illustrates how the company conducts their business.

The company had managed to produce working software, and **pay for less than half of the true development value**, so it was (once again) a **huge win** for them.

I was de facto the only one who did not ""play along"" and, naturally, there had to be consequences. 

I was stripped of my role, hadn't gotten a raise, the position promised to me was given to a colleague (*he did earn it though, in blood and tears*).

The younger colleagues had all quit the job, only the senior backend developer remained with the company (*and only because he was offered promotion+money, which was good for his career path*).

Actually if you think about it, we were both promised the same **carrot-on-a-stick** from the very start, as the managements attempt to **induce** mild (to severe) **competition** in order to ensure extra hours were put into the work. **They also wanted to see (test) which one of us is more permeable to manipulation so they could promote that one.** 

&amp;#x200B;

The company wanted me gone now that the projects had been delivered, and I had already found a new job (*during the peak of a COVID lockdown, finding a job was not as easy as it normally is*), they knew I had in my possession the ""diary of mobbing"" (*as leverage*) so in the end they had been deprived of the opportunity to sue, and so I was ""allowed"" to depart peacefully, without further aggravation.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Subtle subterfuge**

Since the company had in the past stopped me from jumping ship I intentionally told one of my colleagues I was going to choose ""Company Z"" as my next employer. 

I was indeed interviewing with the ""Company Z"" at that time, but it was my intention to accept company Xs offer all along.

It seems the a-holes did in fact try to act upon the information I fed to them, because ""Company Z"" had abruptly stopped the hiring process with no explanation nor return information given. 

I expected as much.

I successfully begun working for Company X, and everyone lived happily ever after.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Pretending to be me**

Since I was involved directly with a couple of key accounts as a principal engineer, the largest key account asked the company for my direct involvement on their product because they were extremely satisfied with the services that I offered, so, being unable to comply, the company lost their #1 key account and the budget that came from this source. They had to let \~20 people go due to that.

I was also deeply involved with another one of the largest key accounts, so after I had left, the company had no option than to make a colleague of mine PRETEND he was me in all e-communication with the key account to keep them happy, and so they kept billing my services for months after I had stopped working for them.",1,1628683388

Thought I’d share a story when I was still doing support calls for a local ISP a while back.

We all know what happened on 9/11/2001, and that morning I was going to work. Once I get in everyone was gathered around the TV watching the news. One of the thing that I’ll always remember is that our call center was eerily quiet, so used to having people calling. I get a call and I pickup and it was a lady who was moving to a different house and was calling to change her service info. I had to put her on hold and once I pick up, she asked “Are we at war? The hold music was turned on to the news and they were talking about buildings collapsed.”
I said, “Ma’am, you know the World Trade Center buildings in New York? Planes crashed into them and they no longer exist.”
She was shocked and said, “OMG, what? I need to get off the phone and watch what’s going on…..”

Then there was another lady who called later and asked if her connection was down was because of the towers being destroyed………🙁",1,1628655459

2213,Tales from Gansa,"First of all, sorry for my english, not native speaker. 

This situation was a couple of years ago, I worked mantaining and fixing computers, monitors and fiscal printers in a large company that manufactured eyewear such as glasses and contact lenses and that kind of things. There were like 50 diferent stores in all of the provincia (I would say state I guess). 

One day I get a call from the cashier in the furthest location we own. I'm talking like 2 hours by car at least from HQ.

Me: Hi, this is IT, how can I help you?

Gansa: Yes, hello, this is Gansa from far away location, we are having a problem with the fiscal printer, is not printing and we don't have ""talonarios de facturacion"" (this is a piece of paper you use to write the receipt by hand in case the fiscal printer is not working)

Me: Ok, let's check the basics first. Is the printer connected to the wall? 

Gansa: Yes. I already checked.

Me: Is it on then?

Gansa: How can I tell? 

Me: (She uses this 100 times a day and didn't notice the green led?) It should have a green led and a second led blinking constantly. 

Gansa: No, I don't see anything.

Me: Ok then, I'm on my way. 

I hang up, grab my tools, a new printer (this is a problem because we need to configure everything for that store in particular, we can't just exchange it.), a power cable, a serial cable (Yes, I know, obsolete.) 2 ""talonarios de facturacion"", my car keys, and drive to the store. 

\*2:40 hours of fighting traffic I arrive at the store\*

I walk in the store, I speak with the manager and give him the ""talonarios"" and he thank me and I get behind the counter to check the problem.

Took me 4 seconds to know that the printer is not plugged in the wall. But I don't see any socket available. (In this store, we make the counters with the correct ammount of sockets to plug in the essensials alone, the employees have lots of sockets available in the storage room for personal use.)

I checked the only one that doesn't look familiar, and follow the cable. It was a charger for a phone. The cashier unpluged the fiscal printer and connected her phone. I calm myself of the bloody rage that is coursing in my very core and call the manager, I don't speak to him. Just point to the cable and keep pointing uptil I reach the wall. His face was priceless. 

Manager: GANSA!!!!!

Gansa (Scared): What? 

Manager: Dis you connect you charger to the wall?

Gansa (Clueless): Yes!

Manager: And you had to unplug something to do it?

Gansa: Yes, but everything was working when I unplu... Ohhh.

Me: Yes, about that. Didn't I asked you if the printer was plugged to the wall?

Gansa: Yes, but I did check! 

Me: Well, you checked wrong. You know where I work? I came asap from HQ. 2 hours and 30 minutes to get here, and you unplugged the printer to charge your phone! Why didn't you use the storage room for that?

Gansa: ""Mumble something"".

Me: What?

Gansa: I can't see the notifications if the phone is in the storage room...

Me (grabing my things): I'm going to report this to your sales supervisor since is a direct breach of the sales agreement and your contract. You can tamper with the hardware in the store.

Manager (realizing the fault is also his): I can manage this issue, don't you worry OP.

Me: Yeah, I know how you manage things apparently. I will speak with the supervisor anyway, I have to report this issue in the ticket. Good night.

Without a single word I left the store and went home. 

The next day I reported everything in the ticket and sent a mail to the sales supervisor and the sails manager, my manager and the store.

Gansa wasn't fired, but quit a week later, the manager was demoted to cashier and I got one more week of vacations from my manager. 

THE END

Thanks for reading and will see you again in the next one!",1,1628641209
2214,When the errors are not what they seem...,"So I worked as a hardware engineer and this happened about 3 years ago.

Our company developed a tool I'll just call MIW (Making It Work) which was essentially a hardware emulator for real life signals that are expected on a machine another company built. They used our MIWs to test their machines and to make sure that they worked properly before shipping them off. The MIW was just a small aluminium box with a bunch of connectors, so nothing fancy. 

Part of my duties was assembling the MIWs and testing them with Logic Analyzers and Oscilloscopes to make 100% sure that they are outputting the correct signals. I had to write a 4-ish page test certificate for every single module. Gladly we only had to assemble about 20 a year. 

Then something strange happened. Ever more frequently we got some of the MIW units sent back with a repair order, because according to the customer, they were not working. On the report, it always just stated  ""No/Wrong Output"". OK, so I disassembled the units, measured some traces making sure there were no shorts and then fully tested them, writing the full test certificate again. Interestingly enough, all MIWs were perfectly fine. After the fourth or fifth unit sent to us in a single month, we called the customer asking what that all was about since every unit was perfectly fine and within the specs. We asked them to check their connection cables, reminded them of making sure to screw them all into the MIW during testing (some of the connectors were the D-Sub type ones) and they said to check it all.

A week later we get a package from them with another MIW stating the ""No/Wrong Output"" error along with all their connection cables. I was pretty grossed out when I saw them. The isolation was broken all over the place with the small copper wires showing through, grease, dust and other grime covered everything and after cleaning and testing the cables, I did continuity checks on them. I figured out that about 20% of the connections had loose contacts and a few other ones were completely broken. I wonder why it even worked sometimes...

So I rang up our customer, stated everything and asked how to proceed from there on. Should I just repair the old cables (which I didn't recommend at all) or make new ones which could take a few weeks since we hadn't all the necessary parts stocked. They choose the much recommended option two and I ordered all parts, waited for their arrival, made some new ones, tested them and wrote a full report over my findings. I made sure to include a copy of that report with the shipping to our customer as well as a friendly reminder that if they ever have testing problems again, if the new cables look like the old ones, please send us them instead of the MIWs...

We only had to repair one single MIW since then (but had to make two other cable sets). I don't know how they are treating the cables, but to be honest, I *REALLY* don't wanna know...",1,1628627330

2217,you sent it where? laptop vanishes into repair purgatory,"Another story from my early days as computer support at a University.  One of the professors, we'll call him Bill, had a cool, lightweight laptop, made by a famous Japanese company, mostly known for consumer electronics and being a movie company.  We'll call the company, 2Big2Care.

Bill had some trouble with his laptop, and after some longish phone calls to the 2Big2Care support folks, it was decided that we would send the laptop to the 2Big2Care service center in Northern California.  No big deal, happens all the time.

Of course we shipped so it was fully tracked.  And then we waited.  And waited.  Professor Bill comes to me, what's going on with his laptop?  Can I call them?  Sure, getting stuff fixed is part of my job.  Get all the info, RMA# and so on, and give them a call. 

And here we fell into a major rabbit hole.  Yes, they received the laptop and repaired it.  Don't know where it is.  I spent over an hour with customer service on the phone, mostly talking in circles.   He wanted me to fax him proof that we had shipped it to them and they had received it.  I asked why I needed to do this since they had records that they HAD received it and repaired it.  Didn't matter, it was Procedure.  

I got off the phone, spent some time digging through our files to find the airbill, got the tracking info from the the shipper, got the proof of delivery, faxed it all to the customer service rep.   Who called me back, thanking me for the information, he would now follow up further.  He was always completely professional and polite on the phone, but the system he was working with allowed for zero common sense.  

I think a day went by, Professor Bill is breathing down my neck.  He REALLY wants his laptop back (another Prof had loaned him one, but still).   Sure, I have plenty of projects but he's got his pants on fire about the laptop, so I'm on the phone again to 2Big2Care.   I have the rep's direct number so at least I don't have to explain the whole story to a new person.

Rep is polite as always.  They don't know where the laptop is, they think they shipped it.  I ask for tracking info, maybe its somewhere on our campus, delivered to the wrong person.  Rep does not have the tracking info and says he can't get it.  I say, OK, what the procedure?  You guys lost the laptop, you should replace it.  No, he can't do that.  Ok, please escalate the ticket to your manager or whatever you normally do.  No, sorry he can't do that.  Another ten minutes of conversation, he's telling me there is NO escalation path at all.  He apologizes over and over.  There's nothing I can do or he can do.  We just have to write off the laptop.  I simply can't believe that 2Big2Care does NOT have procedures for this.  They are handling hundreds of repair items per day, I am not the first person to have something go missing.    Rep says he will try again to get the tracking info.

After a while he calls me back.  He has found the airbill!  He contacted the shipper and the item was received.  There's nothing more he can do, we received the laptop.   I am furious at this point, we did NOT received the laptop.   They lost it, or the shipper lost it, they need to put in a claim.  Nope, the package was received that's it.  I politely ask again to talk to a manager, sorry he can't do that.   We go around and around for a while, finally he lowers his voice and whispers that there is a fax number I can send a letter to at 3Big2Care's headquarters in New York.    But please don't tell anyone that he gave me the number.  I take the number and thank him.  I explain, as calmly as I can, that their system is clearly broken.  He agrees.  I ask him to fax me the tracking info for the return, I'll see if I can get something out of the shipping company (you know which one, the guys in Memphis).  

I get off the phone and wander down to where our fax machine is, Rep has faxed me the info.  I'm looking at the airbill, the RMA number is clearly listed on it.  Then I notice that the address is not me, but a large retail electronics shop also in Northern California.  Literally across the Bay from 2Big2Care's repair center.  I am floored completely.  I've been talking to these folks for days, they know where I am, clearly not next door to them.   

I get back to my office and am about to call Rep and tear a strip off him, when my phone rings.  Its Rep and he breathlessly announces that he's figured it out!  The laptop went to a store by mistake.  I'm like, no kidding Sherlock.  He's contacting the store, they'll return the laptop to him, he'll ship it me.  I suggest someone get in a car, drive the 20-30 minutes to the store and pick it up, then ship it to me.  

Sorry, that's not Procedure (big surprise).   Anyway, we did get the laptop back in several more days, then I got to install Linux from floppies, which was an interesting exercise.  And my boss was very complementary about me not loosing my cool with Rep.  Turned out my boss was standing in the hallway outside my office while I talked to Rep.  He thought he would have been screaming at the poor guy after the first five minutes.",1,1628616058

I'll review one of the calls:

$User is User, and I'm $SR.

$User: I cannot believe this - this thing is broken out of the box!! You have to send a new one out, I bet the mail guy dropped it and broke it.

$SR: Ah, let me remote connect and see what's going on.

Less than a minute being connected, the device does not see the monitor attached.

$SR: Looks like the computer doesn't see it. Does the power button on the monitor have a backlight at all?

$User: I don't think so, yeah, I'm pressing it and it's not changing colors.

$SR: Okay, the monitor - is it plugged in to the wall?

$User: No?? That's not a thing, my USB monitor plugged right into my computer!!

$SR: Oh, it's a thing. Do you have the extra cable from the original box?

$User: No.

$SR: ...

2226,That One Student That Plays Kerbal In Lectures,"So I'm a student at uni.
Last summer, I met a guy. His parents had bought him some very high end gaming laptop that he carried around religiously. He was the sort of kid that didn't put any effort in. Sat in lectures playing kerbal space program and such.
Eventually he asked me what he should do as his laptop was sounding like a jet engine taking off. I explained that its a gaming laptop, I'd be surprised if it didn't. He didn't care and just wanted it quieter. I suggested delidding and liquid metal as a joke and we laughed about how much of a bad idea it is.

Skip ahead 2 weeks and he's not bringing his laptop in anymore. He's had his parents buy him some shitty asus because he's actually opened the back, went to put liquid metal on and sprayed it all over the motherboard and now it won't work. Can't say I'm not surprised. He bought a full motherboard replacement and had it working again after about a month.

Skip ahead another 2 weeks and he had left the charging cable for his laptop in the student union and they had tidied it away somewhere and couldn't remember where they put it. He started screaming the place down, crying about how he was going to sue the student union for losing his cable.

End of the year, he didn't come back. Don't think uni life was cut out for him",1,1628513515
2227,What is wrong with my CPU one thread is .1 degree is higher than the other,"This happened way back in 2016.

I used to be the lead tech in a company in the north of scotland. To a custom computer builder and we were having an event to show off some of the projects that we had made (wish I had kept the phone with these msg on it).

So here we go.

I am talking with a entitled guest (EG) who has turned up at the event and he is telling me that he is looking for custom pc. We go through what he wants and I go through my protfolio on the builds we have done as well as show him all the overclocked gaming pc. I show off all the prices on an excel spread sheet. EG looks at it and says ""well I could build it for alot less"" (DUH of course he can as I dont work for free) and then goes on (EG) ""You get parts alot cheaper than I get as your a buisness"". I sigh ""We are a custom builder and we dont make enough computers to get a bulk discount"" (plus in the tech industry it dosent work like that). I appologies and wish him well. I thought all is well and that was the end of it. (WRONG!!!)

The EG begins to send me texts and it goes as follows.

EG: Are you free.

Me: Sure whats up.

EG: I built a system that I was talking about with you

Me: Cool how is it going

EG: There is something wrong with it 

Me: Oh that is not good so what is wrong with it.

EG: the CPU its overheating. 

ME: Shocked and concered. ""How do you know its overheating""

EG: I have a Hardware Monitor and its telling me that thread 10 is 60.01C and the rest is 60.00C.

Me: I face palm (if any techs out there know overheating on any cpu is 90C and above. I calmly ask ""ok how are you cooling the CPU""

EG: I am using a custom colling solution do you think that delidding would help

(delidding is when you remove the metal plate on the top of the CPU and replace the TIM (thermal interface material) with either liquid metal or thermal compound)

Me: I would not as it just looks like its just withing the program and the sensors error gradient.

2229,The most annoying customer ever,"Hello TFTS, this is my first post to this subreddit and my first time ever posting, so I hope I am not breaking any rules.

This  happened a few months ago. It was my first day working as a student at  my university as a student associate. I was working in one of my  classes. I worked alone on my computer in the corner of the course.

I  was doing an assignment which involved looking up information on the  course materials, and I found myself on a page with a bunch of random  numbers, and the information was written in code. I'm not too technical,  so I took them. I was supposed to get the information for the  assignment as well, and I was looking up all the information, so I was  trying to google it. I didn't get the info I needed either, and I was  looking up information that could be used to get the information I  needed.

I decided to go into the  office and ask if I could print the information, since it was so much  easier for me to just print the information without having to Google the  information. The lady that came to me was super nice, and tried to be  helpful. I thought it was a friendly woman, but she was extremely rude.  The reason she was so rude was because she didn't want me to print the  information, and she didn't want me to look up the information.

I  don't know why she didn't want me to look up the information, but she  didn't want me to look up the information. This would've been fine if  she explained that I didn't need to look up the information, but she was  super mean about it. I didn't do it, I didn't ask for help with it, and  now I'm going to have to print the information myself.

I  was really annoyed by her, and I didn't even do another assignment in  that class because I was so irritated by her. I'm not really sure why  she was so mean about it, but I don't know why she was super mean about  it.

TL;DR: I was supposed to print  the information I needed, but she didn't want me to look up the  information, and she didn't want me to look up the information.",1,1628384193

2231,A ferry frustrating ticket,"(This is my first submission and I have no excuse for grammar, typing errors or the other things that seem to make for a preface here)

Many years ago, when band printers and AS400s were a thing, a customer had an intermittent issue where their printer would cease to deliver reams of paper filled with columns of text and figures that no one would read and start to deliver page upon page of random characters that no one could read.

Typically, error would occur, customer calls up, tech dispatched who finds no fault. Tech attempts varied steps involving mechanical tools and dust removal agents of the homing sensors and other diagnostics based on the hyper-informative 7 segment LED display on the main board (that said '0') , checked the connection to the serial comms device was extra snug and then stood around for a suitable length of time ""observing"" the printer operation before leaving with the advice to call again if (when) it happened next time. It would occur for a couple of days then nothing for a week or two. No real discernible pattern.

Now this was in the office of some stock brokers or accountants - some mob who passed for royalty in early '90s Sydney and their office was in a tower with views over Sydney Harbour and in particular Circular Quay. For those of you who have not been blessed with a visit to our beautiful harbour city, Circular Quay is the bit between the Harbour Bridge and the Sydney Opera House where you may have seen the New Years fireworks broadcast from. It also has the International Passenger Terminal where cruise ships dock (they were just P&amp;O Ocean Liners back then). The printer was in a small room with a window that overlooked this view so it was not an unpleasant spot to gaze from while ""observing"" the printer with its snuggly connected serial cable in to the serial comms device while the printer disgorged perfectly aligned columns of text on sheet after sheet of heavily processed tree.

Time passed and, though there had been a report or two in the mean time, a month later I caught this ticket again and returned to spread my tools out to give the impression I could help, check the diagnostics on the hyper-informative 7 segment LED display on the main board (still '0') , polished the capacitors, read a story to the serial comms unit and settled into observe.... when I noticed it was the same ship docked as last time I was there.

To cut this short, (too late you say) , some other techs and I agreed that it was possible the radar of the ship was interfering with the comms to the printer and screwing the data flow and that the radar would only be active on arrival and departure but not while docked. The next time the customer called to report the issue, they confirmed the *P&amp;O Saucy Sailor* was back in port and I suggested they needed to get their comms people to get a better shielded link or comms device in there. I'm assuming that worked as the calls for that issue stopped.",1,1628372743
2232,11th September 2001,"Thought I’d share a story when I was still doing support calls for a local ISP a while back.

We all know what happened on 9/11/2001, and that morning I was going to work. Once I get in everyone was gathered around the TV watching the news. One of the thing that I’ll always remember is that our call center was eerily quiet, so used to having people calling. I get a call and I pickup and it was a lady who was moving to a different house and was calling to change her service info. I had to put her on hold and once I pick up, she asked “Are we at war? The hold music was turned on to the news and they were talking about buildings collapsed.”
I said, “Ma’am, you know the World Trade Center buildings in New York? Planes crashed into them and they no longer exist.”
She was shocked and said, “OMG, what? I need to get off the phone and watch what’s going on…..”

2233,The reluctant learner,"I finally have a story to tell. I've been working in computer repair for almost a year now, but I've been fixing all my families computer issues for almost 20 years. Printer issue? Funlamb, can you fix the printer? Browser issue? Funlamb, can you fix the browser? You get the idea as most of you have been doing this for years as well.

Charectors in our little play:  
$Linda (user, not their real name)  
$Funlamb (Thats me!)  
$Boss (do I really need to explain this one?)

Linda calls our shop and ask for someone to come out and fix her printer/scanner issue she is having. She also wants my opinion on her setup to get a faster connection to the computer upstairs. I can do all those things so I make an appointment. I get to her place and the fun begins.

$Funlamb: Hi, I'm here to fix ~~deine kable~~ your computer issue.

$Linda: Come on in. My scanner isn't sending what I scan directly to e-mail. The guy before you messed it all up.

$Funlamb: We were here before? When was this? 

$Linda: Well no you guys. I had someone else over here and they messed it all up. Now I want you to fix it.  
I already know this is going to be a problem. As you all know there are two types of techs. Ones that know what they are ~~googling~~ doing and ones that don't. My money is on the former and that Linda just didn't like the way things were getting done.

$Funlamb: So what is the issue with the scanner?

$Linda: It doesn't scan directly to my e-mail.

$Funlamab: Ok, let me grab a set and see what's going on. Where is the app you use to work your scanner?

$L: I don't know. 

$F: You don't know what to use to scan from your printer? Let me check the printer. (It's an HP so I find the app from the MacOS Launchpad.) Is this it?

$L: Yes, that's it. I don't know why they moved it. I just haven't been able to scan without it.

$F: I'll just move it onto your dock so that you can find it easily. Now let me try and use it so I know that it works. 

I begin to use the app while she is watching. Mind you I have never used this app before in my life.

$L: Why is it taking so long for you to figure out what you are doing?

$F: This is the first time I've ever used this app. I need to see what it does so I can fix your issue.

$L: Well this is just ridiculous. You should know what you are doing. This is why I hare technology. I just get so impatient with these things.

$F: If you give me a few minutes we can figure this out. (I poke around some more and  
 get the scanner to work.)

$L: Great you got it to scan. Now email it.

$F: Okay, let me try this share button and see if that will e-mail it for you. Nope. It doesn't look like it's going to e-mail from here. Are you sure this was the app you used to scan?

$Narrator: It wasn't...

$L: Well, it's doesn't look the same. Why can't you just figure this out? 

$F: I'll need to find the actual app you use to scan directly to e-mail before we can continue. I think this might be it. Does this look more familiar? 

$L: Yes, lets try that one.

$F: Ok, here we go it looks like it wants you to pick your printer/scanner. Then we will try scanning something. Wait, I can't find the scan button. Hold on.

$L: What do you mean? You just have to scan it. How long have you been fixing computers? Do you know what you are doing?

$F: 10 years (I know if I said 8 months she would have thrown a fit. The reality is I've been fixing all computer for my house hold for 20 years. Sorry not sorry.) It looks like the scan button is hiding under the dock and it's not going to let us click it. Let me change the display settings.

$L: I don't know what that means. 

Here is where I make the mistake of trying to educate her about the display and what is happening. 

$L: Just fix it.

$F: Ok. I'm changing a few things around and there is the scan button. Now we can scan and try to e-mail it. (Scan.....Share.....E-mail) There it is. 

$L: Well, this is just to much work. I used to be able to just hit one button and it would just email it. I'll have to learn how to do it this way I guess. 

$F: This is the only other app I could find that will scan for you. If you could remember what you used before we could work on that but as far as I can see this is it. 

$L: Can you just show me how to do it this way? I'll write everything down so that I can do it when you are not here.

This is where I show her what she needs to do. She writes everything down and practices in front of me and she is getting pretty good at it. I take a look at her wireless setup and see that it is good. We go up to the other computer. I check it's speed and see that it is setup right above the router so she isn't going to need any other expensive equipment to get faster speeds up here since it is literally right above the router that is downstairs. 

$L: Alright, let me know how much I owe you. Thanks for you help.

$F: It was 2 hours of work so that will come out to $$$ ( nothing unreasonable ).

$L: Here you go.

She cuts me a check and I'm on my way back to the office. The rest of the day goes well and I go home thinking I did a good job today.

$Boss: You were right about $Linda. You have to go check the messages. 

$Funlamb: What happened? 

$Phone: You have 1 new message from Linda at 9:30 PM. Hi, this is Linda. Funlamb came to look at my computer and it just seemed like he didn't know what he was doing. My computer is not working the way I want it to and he made everything smaller on my screen. I want someone else to come out and fix my computer at no cost. I will be waiting for you call. 

$Boss: What did you do?

$Funlamb: I fixed her resolution because the app was displaying off the screen so she wasn't able to hit the scan button. 

$Boss: Sounds like she needs to call HP and let them know that the have a UI problem. That will take them about a year to fix. She sounds like she could be a head ache. If you choose not to work with her that is fine by me. 

$Funlamb: Thanks boss.",1,1628364879
2234,retired professor with way too much time,"Another story from the early days of my sysadmin career.  This was at a fairly large public university in the US.  There were a couple of retired professors who liked to come by every couple of days so we had an office set aside with an older desktop system for them to use, mostly so they could feel like they were still part of things.   These guys were universally liked since they were always super nice and appreciative of anything we could do for them.  One of these (we'll call him Bob), used to ride his bike in every couple of days, usually he'd stop by my office for a couple of minutes to shoot the breeze.

One day he stopped me in the hallway and asked if we have any computers that still have 5 1/4 inch floppy drives.  That kind of floored me since I was pretty sure we didn't even have any systems with the 3.5 inch floppies.  We were barely using optical media at this time, almost everything was done over the network, or USB stick.  

I told him I didn't think so, but why did he ask?

Turns out he was cleaning out his garage and had found boxes and boxes of old floppies and wanted to go through them to see what was on them.

I'm kind of sensing a huge project I could get sucked into, helping him with his stroll down memory lane.  So, I ask a few questions.

me:  How long have those been in your garage?

Bob:  Oh, ten to fifteen years.

Me:  So, they been through that many summer/winter cycles?  (This was in the Southwest, garage temperature could get up to 120 degrees F in the summer and below freezing in the winter).

Bob: Well, yeah.

Me:  There's a good chance they are mostly unreadable without sending them to a professional data recovery company, which would cost a lot.

Bob:  I don't want to do that, I just want to check myself.  What do you think I should do?

Me:  Do you think there's any thing like social security numbers or stuff like that?

Bob:  No, probably old programs and things like that.

Me:  I'd start throwing one box per week into my trash can until they're all gone.

Bob:  (looking horrified), I can't do that!  There might be Something Important on them!

Me:  Bob, you said these boxes have been your garage for 10-15 years, you've survived this long without them, don't you think maybe maybe they can't be too important?

Bob:  (throws his head back and laughs), I guess you're right.

Replaced the phone....same problem would happen. Replaced it again....same problem.  proceeded to replace the wiring....same problem.  

Higher level tech was sent out and checked everything....he sat in the chair and problem went away.  Got up and moved...and the problem manifested itself.  He looked out the window at nearby buildings and could see a microwave antenna pointed in their direction.  

He went to that business and found out they had put in a point to point microwave to connect their offices in different buildings that they had line of sight to...except they could just make it by the building between them.  

CEO was in the corner office of that building and the microwave was just clipping his office.  There was enough power to light the lights on the phone so the CEO was getting microwave energy whenever he was in his office. 

He was slowly being cooked on low power.  He was a bit steamed when he found out. (pun intended)",1,1628349094

I had to eat at 12pm, an hour earlier than everyone else, and had to leave at 5pm sharp (admittedly, to catch the train home). I had trouble learning the new concepts like ""data-driven design"". I ended up redesigning and recoding the d3 graphs I was making about 10 times because they weren't up to scratch. I took too many days off. I was too obsessed with a game I was working on at the time (once even staying after hours to borrow a computer to work on it, since I had no PC at home). I admittedly had a bad habit of peeing on the floor, which I did not know I was doing at the time (I know, gross... but my belly was blocking my view). That's just the stuff I can remember.

I was basically the absolute worst nightmare intern you could possibly have.

Still, I never had any hard feelings about being let go. I knew I had fucked up, and I learned a lot about myself: I can't work the same sort of hours as other people (possibly due to my autism), I learned that I actually really enjoy web development, and I'm even more careful in the toilet now...

I've since done amazing things, like getting a game on the Nintendo Switch, been hired as a front-end dev, and I'm also building an absolutely massive (relatively speaking) full stack microservice based game website using my own open source engine in my free time (P.S. Docker is a godsend).",1,1628317278

2239,Popcorn!,"This happened back when 802.11b was state of the art.

A buddy and I were giving training on new software to users at multiple locations, we would be at each location for 4-8 weeks.  We had a suite of equipment that consisted of an entire stand-alone network that would be isolated with no external connectivity.  The servers included DCs, Exchange servers and the necessary components to make it work.

The students were using laptops that would connect to the system using 802.11b PCMIE cards (I told you is was a while ago).  At one site every day at \~0930 the student laptops would loose all connectivity to the network, same time every day, and come back up after a reboot of the WAP.  That damn WAP took about 10 minutes to fully reboot.  We started scheduling a break for 0930 or whenever the network died.

After a couple of weeks of head scratching we discovered an ancient microwave on the other side of the wall from our WAP.  Turns out one of the office workers made popcorn everyday for his morning break and that damn microwave leaked so much RF in the 2.4 band that it would knock our WAP off-line.

Fix action: Move the WAP across the room and recommend to the local building manager that he get a new microwave as that old was probably a health hazard.

For those interested we were in the US Air Force and we were giving training on the Defense Messaging System (DMS) secure messaging system secretaries and other office workers.

2241,"Coding with no specification, the management said ""you don't need a specification you are being paid to use your brain as well as to code""","So as a senior software developer (with some 12 years of experience at that point) I was hired to lead a minor group of juniors for a small-ish company (30-40 employees).

First hint that there might be problems ahead dealing with the management of this particular company was the info I got that the entire previous dev team had rage quit and additionally were being sued by the company.

My first task was to reverse engineer VBA scripts embedded in an excel document (made by a competing company), the idea was to import into our database everything ""as - is"" (in string format mostly), the business rules (validations) were implemented within the said excel template and not in our application. Our application was to simply import user data straight into our data store (no validation, no transformation), and then to export it into a new excel - this new excel would then be distributed to the clients who would then make adjustments to the data (that at this point would pass thru validations implemented within the excel document). As you can see, the idea, in its entirety was TERRIBLE.

The real ""winner"" came shortly thereafter as the sole junior who had been working on an app called ""APP X"" (for the purposes of this article) suddenly quit. The reason he quit was - he knew what the TRUE state of application had been at that point and therefore was 100% certain he could not deliver what was needed to avoid being sued by the client. The guy was a student at the time he was hired by the company to create a C# application, the problem was - he was studying java. The management of this company was COMPLETELY oblivious to such nuances.

Before he left he was tasked to leave behind at least some documentation, which he did - but since he was unsupervised (the company could not spare anyone at that time to take a look at the documentation and see if its ""ok"") so he simply took the screenshots of all the user forms and named them ""UI 1"", ""UI 2"" etc. The documentation was, therefore, completely useless.

At this point I was given first actual tasks on the ""APP X"" - the task was to basically change how the entire application worked in like a 4 weeks time (whilst simultaneously working on other projects). The application was a bit hard to navigate through - it seemed I could not find any repository classes (those are usually used to connect to the data store) but I said to myself ""hey, the guy was a junior he probably hid all his SQL statements somewhere, so no problem, I will find where the SQL was sooner or later"". 

The data was present on the frontend, the list of users, the list of projects, so stuff seemed to function normally.

I was told the application had been  in full production for approximately a year, so I was not (yet) alarmed by not being able to immediately find the SQL. 

Soon thereafter I needed to rework how the list of projects were displayed to admin users, I could SEE the LIST OF PROJECTS but the database was empty, no tables, no projects, no nothing...then it dawned on me...so I did a full ""FIND ALL"" on the entire project and used one of the project names as search criteria - and BINGO! the entire list was there - in HTML, hardcoded.

Obviously the entire app was not, at that moment, ""connected"" to a data store, and this is how it had been working in production for at least a year. All exceptions were being overridden to return a ""SUCCESS"" message, so all testers (on both sides) were completely fooled by this. All of the deletes and updates seemed to be working. JQuery had made sure inserts looked semi-ok as well. 

Ok, so now I was aware of the full extent of the problem at hand, I basically needed to ""connect the app to the data store"" (featuring some 200-ish UI forms), the management said ""how hard can that be for a senior developer, its a simple task"", and under normal circumstances that would be true, you simply take the specification, model the database as per normalization rules, create repository layer (ORM) and design the needed queries. 

The problem was - the entire thing had to be completed in like 3 weeks.

Ok, fine, I said ""give me the specification so I can get started"", the sooner I get started the sooner we will know how quickly the task can be accomplished on 1 (one) senior developer.

So they said:

""We don't have the specification, our former employee had it (in his outlook inbox), and he left, there's no specification, but a senior developer should not need to be told everything, we expect you to THINK as well as to act, all within the previously agreed time constraints."" - the usual managerial mumbo jumbo when they have no clue whatsoever what they are doing but are being pressed by impending doom.

So I asked, ""ok, well, cant the PM visit the client and ask what needs to be done?""

""No, the client must not find out that the application has not been finished, it is in \*production\* after all, if we were to begin asking such question at this point we would end up being sued""

So I said ""Ok, so ...  let us sum this up real quick; the application is a complete fake, its not ""connected"" to an actual data store, the specification is irrevocably gone, and the client thinks that the application is 99% complete and is willing to sue if we don't deliver in 2 weeks?""

""Yes, but that should not be a problem for a senior developer, right? we ARE paying you after all?""

(actually, several payment were being late at that moment in time)

Right, I immediately begun looking for a new job, and the following 2 weeks had passed with no real work being done, so the pressure mounted; I started receiving late night mails along the lines of ""Will we have a working sample delivered to test tomorrow morning?"" so I replied ""No. With kind regards, XY""

At the same time the company brought in a new ""managing director"" to fix things, to discipline people and to make things work - at that point it was really quite obvious the company was gonna burn down, Hollywood style. 

The PM begun arriving at work at 14:00, proceeding directly to nearby café (to continue his drinking), he needed to be properly boozed up before even talking to me, because he didn't have a feeling that I was taking this whole thing seriously enough and that I would cause the company to burn, but at the same time was unable to exert pressure to make me work 120 hrs / week (the overtime was unpaid).

Right about that point in time, the time for me to go on vacation came - lest the vacation days be lost (the laws in my country state that if you don't ""consume"" your paid vacation time by a certain date, the vacation is permanently lost) - so I chose to go on vacation instead of working for the company.

That was the final straw. One week into my paid vacation I got summoned to the office, and got fired for destroying the companies good name and an excellent project that had been successful in production up to that point. 

After all, the client had signed the handover, the testers on both sides signed the acceptance documents. 

A colleague from the ""other"" department (sysops) jumped from his balcony. 

Another colleague threw an ashtray at a waiter at the local bar. 

Entire sales and marketing team left.

Software development department got closed.

The companies assets got ""frozen"".

2242,Similar tales from two different moments in time and in one story.,"A similar ISP horror story reminded me of the joys of making big changes to Internet and phone connectivity. Strap in folks, it's a long one spanning over a decade.

ME
Big-C - Large ISP 
Big-V - Large ISP 

Many moons ago I was already IT for a new car dealership and both the owners and myself noticed that the manufacturer was steadily moving towards a larger Internet presence and moving away from their own Intranet. Working with a continuing troublesome T1 connection for Internet I was happy to make the call to Big-C to start the upgrade process. The building itself was older and in an established retail/industrial area of the city. I was also very aware that there was no physical coax cable into this building much less at the street. I informed Big-C that I needed a site survey done to see what we are looking at to have their connectivity at this location. I used the words ""site survey"" and mentioned multiple times that ""There is no physical cable here"". Day and time scheduled and I updated my calendar accordingly.

The day arrives and I'm on my way there and my phone rings. John Smith with Big-C  ""I'm here, what location inside the building am I going?"" Me - ""Phone room in the middle of the building and I'll be there I just a few minutes"" Cool, now we're getting somewhere. Moments later I'm turning into the parking lot and John from Big-C is pulling out in his van. I stop him and ask what's up? He said and I quote ""There's no coax to this building I can tie into."" FFS ""Do me a favor and park I need 5 minutes of your time"" at which point I go into my diatribe of ""site survey"" and multiple mentions of ""No physical cable"" etc. etc.  Multiple phones calls and visits from Big-C Construction and Sales over details and a final number was laid out. Just under a 1000' of coax trunk to the address, coax install and multiple phone lines (Important later) and a number was agreed upon by both parties. And for those asking I did make sure that Big-C was aware of the multiple ""other"" businesses along their new trunk.

Fast forward more than a decade and the connectivity at the location has gone through phone ports, upgrades and the standard issues but enough to have a decent relationship with Big-C. Enter a new General Manger with a bit more spending power than he should have and thus begins the process of building upgrades including a new VOIP system. Being an older building, network upgrades were necessary to accommodate a new network of phones along side of the current network (Hooray me!). Included in this were fiber lines for voice and a point to point for their remote site. Big-C was actually fairly easy to deal with in this aspect and the move from coax to fiber went well. Minor issues were fixed and porting was completed successfully. On an important side note Internet connectivity was still on Coax since Big-C told me flat out that we would lose our 5 IPV4 statics if we moved it over to fiber. That was a big ""nope"". 

A year or so later enter Big-V. Now Big-V was pretty much out of the picture once active numbers were ported and their old T1 Point to Point was moved to Big-C's fiber. They were still billing for two POTS numbers though. Office wasn't sure what they were for but had received a notice from Big-V that they were upgrading their Central Office to all fiber. That meant that these numbers would need to move over to their Fios platform. I can understand this since the copper in this area was easily over 60 years old and becoming troublesome to deal with. A phone call to Big-V to get more details and schedule a time. This conversation includes ""Big-V has no fiber to this building"" and a ""site survey"" needs to happen. In the back of my mind I was thinking that Fios lines into the building would be nice for redundancy. Shame on me.

The following day and more than a week before scheduled time for the ""site survey"" a dealership manager contacts me and says there's a fire alarm error with a very loud beeping from the console. Yep, found our mystery POTS lines. Contact Big-V on why the lines were disconnected long before the Fios service was even surveyed much less turned on. A bunch of ""this"" and a lot of ""that"" pretty much confirmed that the left hand didn't know what the right hand was doing. After explaining that these lines were for the building fire alarm system they at least reactivated the lines. This should be fun. The scheduled day arrives and I'm there long before John Johnson from Big-V arrives with a box in his hand. I don't even take him to the phone room and he confirms that he's here to move the POTS lines over to their Fios box. Oh, it gets better folks.

I tell John that there are no Fios fiber lines on the premises. His head sinks. John makes some phone calls to what I assume is the right or left hand and soon a big wheel from Big-V construction team shows up. He confirms that there is no fiber on premises belonging to Big-V and that a site survey needs to happen. He's shown where the current copper and Big-C's fiber enter into the building with emphasis that this is the requirement that Big-V has put forth and that it's covering current POTS for the fire alarm. Okay with a thumbs up. Several days later Miss Utility has come out and marked the location for power, water, gas and Big-C's fiber coming in. Things are looking up but I still have this nagging feeling.

Out of curiosity I contact Big-V and confirm that there is a construction ticket in the system and I confirm that the utilities have been marked. I let sleeping dogs lie. On the 30 day anniversary of the first disconnect the alarms on the fire console are going off again. I check and no dial tone. I waste a lot of time on the phone with Big-V with anyone that'll listen and they all say the same thing. All tickets have a note that on the account that ""client has refused upgrade"". I ask who contacted Big-V to cancel? There's no information on ""who contacted who"" to cancel the upgrade. So I ask the following "" Okay so you require a PIN number, address conformation and have a strict point of contact (Myself and owner) to make any type of account modification and you have nothing to show? Supervisor...now!"" After an hour of back and forth along with details of how left hand and right hand communicate I get a promise of a phone call the next morning. It's well past 8 PM at this point and my head hurts.

As I'm going over and over this madness in my head I come to the realization that Big-V is ghosting me and I now need to figure out a way to resolve this mess. Maybe I can temporarily use current fax lines for a dial tone. In the very least until I can get at least two separated lines in from Big-C (A requirement from city fire dept and the alarm company.). At this point I was done with Big-V and needed them out. My eureka moment hits me in the middle of the night. The next morning, tools in hand I enter the phone room and find the older, still active Big-C Phone Modem still connected to coax. Low and behold two active dial tones with nothing connected.  Turns out when we first ported phones over to Big-C these were needed since fax machines were still having problems with digital lines and analogs were recommended. They were never used since it turns out the newer MFP's in place didn't have an issue with digital. So after some reconfiguration of the old lines and a call to the monitoring service on the number changes all was quiet. Labels and a big sign were placed on the phone modem that read ""Don't Touch! Fire Alarm Connections!"". Big-C got us out of the bind and didn't even know it. And what a surprise I never got that phone call from Big-V.

The dealership was sold after a while and as far as I know the setup is still the same. For years a statement I've told pretty much all my clients: "" The biggest communications issues I run into are with communications companies.""",1,1628272423
2243,A train isn't good for coax.,"Worked for an ISP/cable company years ago and this one stands out.

We had a ticket for an install to a house in a rural area.  This house had a train track that ran behind the home and the box on the pole was on the opposite side of the track as the home.  It was a newer area that we serviced and therefore it required a drop to the house from the pole.

Tech was sent out for the install and realized the problem, proceeds to call it in.  Tech wasn't certified to hang a line on the pole.  Supervisor instructed to continue with the install.  He did.

5:00 CSX comes by and runs over the coax that was laid across the tracks.

Of course the tech was sent back out again and was instructed to replace the drop.  He did.

5:00 CSX comes through and slices it again.

After a few more of these work orders it was put in to ELEVATE the drop!!  He did.

About 6 foot off the ground.

5:00 CSX comes through and grabs the coax, proceeds to rip the wiring out of the house, exploding the cable modem on the wall, knocking the PC off the desk and TV's off stands, damages to the bricks on the house, other.

Cable company had to pay for repairs to the bricks in the house and all damaged equipment.  Customer had full package free or as long as they lived there, all channels, fastest internet, etc.

I kept up with the documentation on the account while this was going on and I am glad I did.  This was before smart phones so I couldn't get the proof, didn't carry a cell phone at all back then.

2246,Old Pentium in the basement,"Long time lurker on TFTS, thought I’d share a story from a few years back. English is not my first language.

A couple of years back I worked at a large Software company which develops Payroll/HRM Software, but also did Payroll administration for other companies which didn’t have them in-house. The company at the time had around ~2500 employees.

My job was 1st line support for internal employees. Every phone call, e-mail pretty much went through me and I had to dispatch. Often I also had to do second line tickets as well because we were pretty understaffed.

The team consisted out of multiple employees, my direct colleague which dealt with second line calls. One colleague which only dealt with the phone system. And two elder men which were put in the basement dealing with hardware replacements. We also had one Teamlead.

We only dealt with internal employees and had nothing to do with customers or supported any of the software the company developed. I often did receive calls when software x or y stopped functioning, but always had to point them elsewhere.

I was working there about 8 months in when one of the elder men retired. This was around summer time when things got quiet at the office. My teamlead decided it would be sad to leave the other guy in the basement, and also would be better for us to have him come sit at the office.

My Teamlead confiscated one of the manager office (with the fancy glass walls) next to us for him to come sit there. So we went ahead and started to clean the basement and moved hardware upstairs, every piece of ancient hardware would be given to charity (there was A LOT!). We put everything in carts for charity to pick up.

The basement desk consisted of two workspaces, but there were three desktops, one of the desktops was an old Pentium III only had power and ethernet connected to it. My teamlead and I cleaned up the desktops and put the Pentium III inside of the cart.

Three weeks went by and most of my colleague’s went on holiday. I received a call from the software development team there was a problem with a payroll conversion for a large customer. Like I mentioned earlier, we do not deal with inhouse software/customers. 

The next day I had a manager at my desk explaining that a company delivers them files which they upload into a webserver which converts the files so it becomes compatible with the inhouse software, which can then get the Payroll going. I explained to him that I had no idea what he was talking about and should be going to the Sysadmins to check on the webserver.

Later that day I both had the manager and one of the Sysadmins sitting at my desk explaining they couldn’t reach http://10.10.30.21/ anymore. At this point I’m getting really annoyed, explaining this isn’t my problem nor do I manage the infrastructure. I already am busy as it is being the only support employee. They both explained a large Bank employee’s didn’t receive their salary and that this is a huge problem.

Things went back and forth for a couple of days, and during those conversations I started to get more and more information about the webserver being down. It turns out the employee who made the webserver left the company years ago. Also there was no documentation. 

Went outside for a smoke and started thinking about the whole situation where I suddenly thought to myself, can it be one of the old desktops? Surely it can’t be the old Pentium III machine right? I went to the basement and went through the disposal cart. Took the machine up, connected it to a monitor. It started booting Linux (forgot which one). Once booted up I tried connecting to the webserver, but still received a timeout.

I walked to one of the Sysadmin’s to check the latest DHCP leases and try reaching the webserver on each IP, first try.. the webserver. I asked the software department if this was the webserver they were referring to, which got confirmed.

I also explained that this was a Pentium III machine that apparently has been sitting in the basement for years, which didn’t matter to anyone, of course not, their webserver was working again wasn’t it? I told them to deal with the issue and pull the information off the machine so we can get rid of it as it is now running under my desk… Also no one had the credentials for the Linux machine.

Weeks went by and the machine was still collecting dust under my desk. I started threatening the department that I will unplug the machine soon if they didn’t do anything about it. I asked if they couldn’t call the employee that left the company if he still had the credentials, this is where the story gets a little sad though. It turns out that not only he left the company, but also had a stroke in his backyard which left him laying on the ground for two days and has been in a coma ever since.

I suddenly felt really bad about the whole situation and the way I have been reacting. I offered the software department to see if we could hire a Consultant to convert the machine to a virtual machine at their costs which was agreed upon. After finding one, it took the Consultant three days to convert the machine which I passed on to the Sysadmins to run on ESX.

No one expected that this conversion webserver for salary payment of large Bank was running in the basement all these years. The ones that did know left the company either years ago, or retired.

Until this day I still think that machine is running.

A year later I left the company, but that is a different story.",1,1628248106

2252,The ISP closed our account without notice,"I started a new job as the sole IT worker at a small business with 30 employees a couple weeks ago and have been flooded with deciphering the crazy situations they've gotten themselves into.

I ask the owner to see the ISP bill and notice they are paying $200 for a phone they aren't using and only have the 50/50 Mbps plan. I get permission to port the phone number and renegotiate our rates.

I call up the ISP and ask the following:

Me: Can I renegotiate this rate please? We are porting out our phone number to our regular VOIP provider.

ISP: Sure thing! Here's 100/100 Static IP Business plan for $60. We'll keep your phone service on the account until the port is completed.

Me: Just to be sure, we are ONLY cancelling our phone service, not the Internet service. This won't affect our internet service correct?

ISP: Yep! This won't affect your internet! We'll send a tech out to set it up.

The tech comes out the next day to tell me my static IP block and heads out. After not seeing a speed boost, I check the config on the router and notice they had 5ghz turned off, and everything is on a fully congested 2.4ghz channel. I fix that and everything gets a nice speed boost.

Two days ago I noticed the port finished, I call the ISP back again to verify the port completed and to verify the phone service is disconnected. They say it's all good.

I called again yesterday to verify our new billing amount, and to verify that our internet service will be unaffected. ""It all looks good here!""

I get to work early today and notice that there's no Internet. I've got link lights but I can't ping the ONT. I call the ISP to see what's going on, they can't find my account, then they hang up on me. 20 minutes wasted.

I call back again, they find my old account and try to see what's happening, but then hang up again. 30 minutes wasted. Meanwhile, everyone else is returning to work and can't do shit without internet. The owner is breathing down my neck wondering what's happening.

I call back again and get a competent worker this time, they find my account. Turns out they closed my account because they assumed we didn't want it anymore after we ported our number out. This is despite being told multiple times that everything is ok, and I made it explicitly clear we still needed internet.

She opens us a new account account and says a tech will come out to activate it within about 24 hours. This is not negotiable. So no internet for basically the rest of the week.

After explaining the situation to the owner we start setting up workers with wifi hotspots on their phone, but start running into problems. Turns out EVERY single computer on the network has a static IP set, despite DHCP being setup and working on the router. We start turning DHCP back on for every client one by one.

Assistant doesn’t file a report but instead had a outburst on the phone with a random / unrelated tech support person on the companies general support hotline (Exec would need VIP support in-person since we have teams dedicated for that) this poor soul gets yelled at with 0 details and gets hung up on. she tries to gather what she can and report it to her super visor who seeks out another super visor who seeks me out. (its confusing because there are multiple offices in different states and the execs fly around alot)

Me: “okay where do you need me to be”
Supervisor: “he’s on the 9th floor”
Me: “No body here”
*I am added to a group chat*
someone else : “ 4th floor “
Me: “no one here”
*starting to realize no one knows where he is, and what his specific issue is because this is all reactionary from the manager. ordering their legions of staff to throw their bodies onto a problem with no idea whats going on or what their roles are for that matter (severely understaffed and mismanaged) *

after a bunch of back and forth she procures me the Execs number I just casually call his cell.
Me: “Hi, which floor are you on , you need help with wifi?”
executive: “oh im actually (in a different state) today and i resolved it myself” *and didnt tell anyone*

her Manager: grumbles* and tells the tele-tech she needs to get her details straight.  

Im a contractor so i kinda dont care about some of the hierarchies at the company. I thanked her for being able to gather all the information from a angry phone call about an issue unrelated to her duties.
Managers are treated like children and yelled at so they just react to every situation by drumming up chaos ; not standing their ground regarding THEIR own protocols. 

sigh* 
i known it’s not a very spicy or dramatic one but its just frustrating that this kind of thing is rampant. maybe yall can relate.",1,1628176657

2257,Because its not a computer,"I used to do tech support for my family.

I stopped because it was too hard (emotionally). My mother is incredibly stubborn and creative in the new way she finds to do things on computers that result in them not working. A close family friend who is a IT professional had taken over, which worked well until he moved to the other side of town.

A few months back I had a spare usb docking station, monitor, mouse and keyboard, so I gave it to my family to make it easier for my mother to use her laptop.

She asked me to set things up, however there was a covid lockdown and I had a phone conversation where I said something to the effect of 'there isnt anything to set up, you just plug it all in and use it. try that first and i'll trouble shoot if it doesn't work'. 

Nothing happened

Covid lockdown finished and when I'd visit the docking station remained unused.

And at some point I just set the thing up.

&lt;time passes&gt;

A few weeks ago I said, how about I show you how to use the docking station. I got her laptop, plugged it into the docking station and everything worked. Mum was fine and happy and browsing away. I left.

20 min later I get home and get a call.

M: Hey what password do i use to log in?

T: The same one you always use

M: No I want log into the new device

T: Use your laptop password to log in

M: No I want my laptop off and i want to use the docking station to browse and connect to the internet

T: That's not possible, you have to use your laptop to do that. You are using your laptop, just use your laptop password

M: I dont want to use my laptop. I've turned it off. i just want to use the thing you set up to use the laptop. Whats the pass word for it.

T: Huh, sorry, I dont follow you want to do what?

&lt;I also have no idea how there was anything to log into if she had turned off the laptop&gt;

M: I want to browse the internet with the thing you set up.

&lt;at this point I had an epiphany&gt;

T: Mum, that thing is not a computer. There is only 1 computer there. Your laptop. without your laptop there is nothing to connect the internet to. That thing just makes it easier to connect other things to your laptop

M: But I want to use the internet on the thing

T: You can't, it's not a computer

M: But I thought it could connect to the internet

T: It's not a computer. It can't

M:.....

M: OOOOooooohhh. I think I get it. I'll call you later &lt;click&gt;",1,1628159495

It was amazing how dirty some cubicles were. One time it took 2 bags of trash out before we could move her desk.

And the best was asking us guys with tool bags and uniforms that obviously weren’t with the company with help with their computer issues. I made sure it was plugged in and running correctly before I left, but no I can’t help you with your passwords or email issues, I have a temporary badge and probably should be escorted.

2260,"""I DID'NT SPEND SEVEN YEARS IN MEDICAL SCHOOL TO FIX YOUR #%*^!!!!!!""","Working for a manufacturer of things that were NOT medical related, I got a voicemail from an MD screaming about some piece of hardware.

""YOUR STOOPID &lt;device&gt; DOES'NT WORK AND YOUR VOICEMAIL BOX IS NOT CONFIGURED.""

(This was on my personal voicemail, which is configured.)

No phone number, no name, no idea where the call originated from, the only thing I was certain of is that we were NOT in the business of making medical instruments of any kind.

A few similar messages landed in my vMail in the ensuing week, until I FINALLY managed to live-answer one of these calls. After calming the caller down, I pieced together what was going on.

The medical device in question was a bit of office automation, nothing patient-facing thank god. The caller described having trouble with this device and calling the phone number on the leaflet that came in the shipping carton with said device. That phone number was mis-printed, and thousands of these devices were shipped with a bogus tech support number.

The number printed on the paper was one of my 500 DIDs, coincidentally unused, with no TN and no voicemail box. Those few callers that managed to leave me messages simply pounded '0' until my employers' admin assistants (there were three sharing call answering duties) answered. They apparently didn't question why IT support requests were coming in on an outside line, they merely forwarded the call to my number.

Until the day I ripped that PBX off the wall, that DN still had an outgoing message in my malodorous dulcet tone: ""You've reached &lt;not the company you think you called.&gt; Please note that we DO NOT make the device for which you are attempting to get support, THAT company misprinted their documentation and gave you the wrong number. For support on your &lt;device&gt; please call &lt;medical devices company on the other side of town&gt; at xxx-xxx-xxxx.

&amp;#x200B;

THAT was a fun call with their IT department. I decided I should speak tech-to-tech, rather than try to explain it all to their marketing or quality staff. A few TalesFromTechSupport quality anecdotes were shared while we brainstormed the solution on my end and while she started rattling cages in her own shop.

2261,"Where are the project requirements? ""What do you mean? That's what we're paying YOU for!""","Over the last year or so I've had the, uhhhh, pleasure of watching roughly 2/3 of our little consultant company's work force quit and run for the hills, mostly due to the mismanagement of a pair of absolute train-wreck projects.

One to ""upgrade"" a completely functional but no-longer-supported-by-the-vendor Angular tool/site.... by completely rebuilding it all as a dedicated .Net thing. We're not going to dwell on all the silliness involved in this, though I will mention that when I first pitched in they handed me a 1200 line STATIC HTML page that was very obviously created by copy-pasting the angular output and having an Intern manually go through it and set up the mappings... I don't really know how they wound up at that point, only there was a LOT of uninformed promises and ""estimates"" in early phases and the constant rotation of people working on, realizing it's insane, and then quitting. Eventually, at the cost of the company's most-senior developer/architect, that nose-dive leveled off to the point where (only 8 months behind schedule) the customer now has an app just as good as the one they started with, and we can now start working on improvements.

The other project didn't go nearly so well. 

To start with some important groundwork: our little company's CEO is comically out of touch. He used to code at some point, at least that's what he says, and believes this makes him an adequate subject matter expert as far as estimates and approaches go, and that he's ""one of us"" (seriously, he keeps dragging the one on-site Junior Dev out to random lunches to ""shoot the shit"" and has invited us all to his virtual birthday party next month with instructions to ""bring an amusing or embarrassing anecdote about working with me"". Imagine that energetic, but unqualified guy that got added to your team, so you do your best to push him towards the pointless busywork tasks and have someone more senior doublecheck literally everything he does in case he accidentally sets the office on fire... except he's the CEO and perfectly willing to override/fire anyone who second guesses his genius. He does not grasp why he ""doesn't get more honest feedback"", though I'm working on that.

My role in this is just being a senior-ish dev on an absolutely bullet-proof contract, who's been feeling bad about the two remaining junior devs and have been doing some OT (paid, you better fuckin believe me) to help triage the train-wrecks and get things moderately back on track. However, since I'm cheerfully cynical about the whole thing and perfectly willing to call the CEO's bullshit (what's he going to do, fire me and let the customer direct-hire me without breaching their contract?), I've somehow been designated as both his ""Friend"" and ""Only Expert Worth Listening To"". I mostly just act as an interpreter between him and the Junior devs, since there's a direct correlation between people quitting and how much they have to interact with crazy CEO man.

Now, on to the second train-wreck project. When I first got brought in to survey the wreckage and give my input on what needs to be done to get things back on track, I was told we were writing a fair-sized piece of middleware to transform incoming web requests and then shove them into various databases, replacing a bunch of SQL stored procedures that nobody at the customer's company is qualified to maintain. That all sounded decent enough, until I asked to see the Requirements and Tech Design Docs... which didn't exist. That's not to say there was nothing, we had piles of documentation on the assorted use-cases for the middleware, mostly made by the single junior dev who did 90% of the actual code work, who extracted the data from the customer's team via an absolutely grueling series of meetings. We also had piles and piles of other documentation from the 3-ish prior attempts to inject some amount of sanity and order into the process, which were all put on hold by the CEO, since ""the team needs to be writing code to show the customer we're working hard"". Needless to say, those people quitting was a complete surprise to him.

So, in short, we've got a project with little-to-no documentation, but on the bright side, that one junior dev had been soldiering through like a champ, working with the ground-level folks at the customer to generate requirements and design on the fly so he could keep writing code, and GOOD code at that. Honestly, it looked to me like all we really had to do was shake some concrete OFFICIAL requirements out of the customer and draw up a decent design docs, and then just let the junior dev keep working without the CEO or Customer jogging his elbow all the time. I relay this information to the CEO, and volunteer to be the customer-shaker for this so I can make sure we actually get what we need... and then get told not to worry about it, he'll handle it personally in his meeting with the customer's Chief of Ops coming up that week.

Well, after several days of working on getting internal documentation straightened out with the team (Junior Dev and a newly-hired mid-level guy, who the CEO fired for ""not being a team player"" within the month), I finally get the word back from the CEO about how the meeting with the customer went, and the word is ""Stop"". No more coding, none at all, just sit there and document stuff. I was honestly elated, since this was what I'd been telling him was needed since the start, but then I found out the reason why: The customer didn't want our code, not because it was bad, but because HE'D NEVER ASKED FOR IT IN THE FIRST PLACE. The contract was apparently to analyze their internal system and generate a requirements doc FOR the customer, preferably without wasting any of his people's time asking silly questions like, well, what their damn requirements are. This is where it finally clicked for me and I realized that it was the leadership on BOTH sides that was crazy, not just ours.

See, anyone who's been around the block a few times as a dev can tell you that Requirements are a huge, absolutely crucial, and easily fuck-up-able part of any project, and the surest way to torpedo the whole project is to have the Requirements written by people who aren't the actual users. While it's possible to hire a consulting company to HELP you make a good requirements document, telling them just to do it for you is a catastrophically stupid idea, virtually guaranteed to end with the Customer holding a completely useless pile of garbage and lawsuits about how much they'd paid for it. The customer's COO didn't agree though, he didn't want his people wasting their time on planning their own system's upgrade, those are hours they could be doing REAL work!

This COO guy had gone through negotiations at least five different larger contracting firms, who all dug in their heels on the requirements issue and refused to take on the project. So, rather than take the fucking hint, the COO decides to hire a separate firm just to make the Requirements documents, so he could then take them to the larger companies he'd already been negotiating with. Of course he didn't have much better luck, since now he was just explicitly asking for the stupid part up front, but then enter our CEO... who happily agreed that it sounded totally reasonable and he'd get a team on it right away.

The first two senior people our CEO tried to put on the contract flatly refused, but one of our Project Managers was incapable of telling him ""no"", so the project started with the PM and a few devs, who quickly realized what a shit-show this all was and all took turns quitting, until (after four complete team changes) it was just the Junior Dev doing the work and the CEO acting as the Project Manager. Despite all this turnover and our CEO's magical ability to reshape his perception of reality to fit his internal narrative, this shouldn't have been enough to forget what the whole point of the contract was, but he maintains that the initial customer contract was for a whole Rebuild, not just generating the requirements for it out of thin air. Fortunately our CEO had a moment of lucidity and dropped the contract rather than press further.

The final cherry on top of this that led to so much wasted code, was that the customer's leadership was just as bad at communication as ours, AND HIS ENTIRE TEAM THOUGHT WE WERE THERE FOR A REBUILD TOO, hence all the time they were willing to spend talking with Junior Dev and testing his work. We had to tell THEM what was going on, and at the final meeting where we handed over the jumbled pile of documentation we'd accumulated and the 85% complete piece of middleware, you could just hear the frustration and resignation in their voices as they talked about how close they got to replacing all the SQL spaghetti they'd been dealing with for the last 10 years.

And thus ends the Tale of Two Idiots.",1,1628111723
2262,Was I really out of line here?,"So I'm keeping it vague-ish because I don't want any more trouble than I've already got in this situation, but it's kinda been eating away at me for a couple of months.  


We recently migrated two databases into a new one, this means loads of data cleanup is necessary, so we start with the most important records first....our biggest clients. I work my way through the list alphabetically over a period of a year. One customer in particular was really messy, like 15 duplicates, and one of our biggest sources of revenue.   


I contact the person managing that customer and ask for a meeting to clear up these records. They refuse. I put it on the backburner and circle back around to monthly, hoping this person will eventually have an opening in their schedule. I messaged them 5-6 times over a year....never got a reply except that first one basically just saying no.  


Eventually, someone else notices the mess. They have no idea that I've already tried, but they know I'm the person to go to, so they email me asking if I can help with cleaning up XYZ Customer. Well, I take this as 'my in'. I'm excited. I want it cleaned up, it's the last one on my list, and I know it'll make so many people's lives easier. So I reply and say something along the lines of 'Yes! Please! I've been trying to get in touch with so and so for many months but haven't received a response. If you have all the info needed, let's meet and get it done'  


Well, for whatever reason, she forwards that email to the original person (I assume to ask for any info they might have that might help with the cleanup). That person gets SUPER mad! Is totally insulted that I said they didn't reply to me several attempts, thinks I'm throwing them under the bus, flags with my manager and my manager's manager. I then get called into a meeting to talk about my 'unprofessional email'. I explain my position. Thankfully my manager understands where I'm coming from....but this person is high up and basically has it out for me now....like wants me fired....even though I'm good at my job and everyone gives me praise. My manager has been emailed multiple times by multiple people to thank me for my help.....I know this is why he understood my perspective.  


A couple of weeks goes by, and apparently, getting the work done was still not enough, they were still upset and so I had to write an apology. But even my apology (which had to be reviewed before sending) wasn't good enough. My manager had to go through my apology and edit it....we basically wrote it together, and in the end, I didn't really agree with what was said, I don't think I did anything wrong or unprofessional, but I sent it anyway to keep the peace. Everything has since smoothed over...I guess....but it just made me feel really angry. I'm a humble enough person to accept when I've done something wrong and do what I can to right it. But I don't like making apologies I don't mean or that I don't think are deserved/necessary.  


Am I really way out of line for stating a true fact....that I'd essentially been ignored up to this point but was eager to help (Honestly, I was just trying to give background). Or is that unprofessional? Should I have not mentioned that part and just said 'sure, let's do it'.  I'm happy to take my licks when I deserve them. I have learned many lessons the hard way, and have been very cautious about what I type in emails since then.

2266,Wetware Blockchain for screamtesting a printer,"Two weeks ago, we had an external technician (ET) in our office to start to redo all of our patch panels.

Last friday, we got the last missing printer from the printer swap started last year. It didn't want to work. 

Yesterday, I hears my teamleads boss (TB) talking to another colleague just outside my office, asking him, if there is any way to wire a network port so it only not supports printer.

I am in no way anything it related in this company except user, but this was my cue.

I opened my office door and explained wiring of an Ethernet port as simple as I could. Further, I made an educated guess, why the new printer wouldn't get connected to the authentication and print server. At the time, I was talking about VLANs, TB was looking at me, as if I was talking Mandarin. I suggested that he needed to contact our corporate Helpdesk that they adjust the VLANs on the ports of the switch.

He didn't contact the corporate helpdesk, because ET and his assistant EA where in the building to finish the last patch panels.

After some blind guessing, we somehow figured out that one port in the office across the hallway seemed to have the right VLAN assigned. Now we just needed to redo that one patch...   
Easy, right? Well... The port wasn't labeled.

After some discussion someone suggested to pull plugs out of the patch panel one after another, until the link light on the printer goes dark. We all agreed to it and I was about to go upstairs to look at the printer, as TB ment9that he has no signal on his cellphone.

Tje patch panel is in the basement of this quite old building with walls and ceilings full of steel. The Printer was two stories above.

In the end ET was at the panel. EA was in the stairwell at the bottom. TB was in the stairwell on my level and I was sitting next to the printer.

ET would yell ""now?""
EA would yell ""now?""
TB would yell ""now?""
 I would yell ""still lit""
TB would yell ""still lit""
EA would yell ""still lit""
ET would plug the plug back into the panel, would pull the next plug and would yell ""now?""

After 20 something tries we found the right port and were able to bring the printer online.

Well, he also took my instructions of power cycling his modem to the extreme to unplug all 3 cables from the back of it, coax, rj45, and power.  Not in that order.  I guess he needed a free hand and out of bad decision making he decided to hold the power cable with his teeth/mouth.

2268,Russian honesty meets Australian humor.,"I work as a developer for a small company based in Australia. Years ago, before I joined, we got bought out by a Russian company and started working for them. It was mostly just us servicing the technology that they bought us for but as the Australian company developed we started to branch out into other areas. 

A few years ago now we had a project idea that the Australian team would develop. The idea was to unify all of the disperate technology we were developing into one package. It was a successful project which has since saved us so much time.

Now that we were writing new things not just servcing the old our code changes were being reviewed closely by the Russian team. They were nice and smart people but they were definitely not afraid to point out every flaw in our code.

One day on of us commits some code that is just bad. Its got obvious flaws but we wanted to push it in there to get our work done for the week and to test it out. We planned to fix it the next week.

Only an hour later one of the Russians has reviewed the changes and had a lot to say. The most memorable quote was that the entire changes we made were just ""shitcode"". He really laid into our work and we definitely deserved it.

Our manager saw that and immediately emailed the Russian team saying that this kind of feedback was rude and not helpful. The Russians accepted that as they weren't trying to be rude, just honest.

However our team loved it. ""Shitcode"" became a recurring joke in our team and we started to use it in our own code reviews. Its a good thing that Australians have a healthy relationship with swearing.",1,1628050225

I always (pro tip) look-up who I'm about to meet, to see who they are. This *researcher* was a *networking security scientist*. Their network wasn't working and *they* couldn't figure-out why.

Having had setup a few consumer-grade switches and hubs, I had a rudimentary knowledge of basic networking. You know, make sure all the wires are attached at each end, the little springy clips have to be engaged, LEDs light-up when things are working, that sort of stuff.

So, when I get assigned THIS ticket, I'm thinking; this is going to be *embarrassing*. What the Hell am I going to be able to do for a *NETWORKING F'n SCIENTIST*?!?!?

Looking a bit closer, I see the hub has a power cord pulled-out from the back by several inches. Probably troubleshooting and removed power for some reason... I plug it back-in.

EVERYTHING lights-up! I verify that there's connectivity to the corporate network, and my work is... *done? Riiight, CAN'T. BE. THIS. EASY.*

They got in touch for a favour. We normally deal with technical briefs and design work but this is an odd one - head of design(HOD) says yep no problem.

So the issue is - when these guys ping a new TV show over to the satellite TV company, they sent over an accompanying graphic which is used for 'coming up next' style overlays and I think in the EPG.

It's pretty archaic, its a low Res gif format with a 32 colour palette that must have certain colours in it. Now normally they use an ancient Mac with some 90s software on to create this file but, disaster, the machine been retired!

So armed with this minimal knowledge and a couple of examples I go, well ok we just need to configure Photoshop and we can generate this no problem. I ping it back to the HOD and say, look it's XYZ, Photoshop job, give it your best man for a day off you go.

He's not happy but gives it to the guy, who I suspect goes 'fudge this' and doesn't manage to get it done.
I come in early to an arsey email from HOD cc'ing in the MD etc etc - ""it's a Dev job"", not possible etc etc

Classic *FFS right FINE* - boot up Photoshop at 8am (god knows why it was on my machine, years since I used it) - some googling and testing and 1 hour later I sent over 12 point instructions with screenshots.

Well, that was a mistake. HOD refused to try it and claimed it didn't work etc etc. I'm pretty busy as I have the next day off so no chance to smooth things over.

I come in after my day off, out of a meeting first thing and the HOD and designer are both over the shoulder of my junior dev (JDEV), muttering complaining etc. Poor JDEV is sweating away!

Turns out they had taken the opportunity *all day yesterday* to try to get my JDEV to build some abortion of script to combine images into the format and bundle the correct pallette of 32 colours etc. He was barely anywhere struggling with installing image libraries, and just couldn't make any progress.

HOD was furious and stormed over ""your dev's are rubbish this is a simple job etc etc"".

My response:
""I've sent instructions that are simple enough for client to follow, and they have the software already. You went behind my back and wasted development time.""

""And finally... JDEV is extremely colourblind; that's why he doesn't know what the hell you're talking about.""",1,1628033719

2274,The one where it's up to us to fix even though we didn't break it,"I support healthcare software that has interfaces with third parties, e.g. labs, scheduling software, other electronic medical records (EMR) programs, etc.

I got a case saying that data is no longer transferring to a third party after the customer updated the software of the third party. I figured that maybe the customer built a new server for the new version of the third party's software and didn't know how to change the IP we're sending to. Simple enough, right?

The case was put in by Laura (names changed to protect the innocent) and in the case description, she requested that I call Debbie. I figured Laura is some admin telling me to call someone in IT. So, I called Debbie and the phone menu answered. I hung up immediately because it's the third party and I figured that they won't be able to get me into our software to change the IP, or get me on the server that has our software on it, etc.

I called Laura and she asks that I call Debbie anyway. It seems Debbie is going to be able to explain the issue better. But Laura does tell me that they upgraded the third party's software a couple days ago and appointments haven't been reaching the third party since then. She said ""a couple days"" and I thought ""Today is Monday, so it was probably done over the weekend."" 

About this time, the customer's account rep for our company starts sending out emails. Apparently the customer is going crazy (note: I've already talked to them, but okay) and we need to escalate this issue! I put off calling Debbie for a couple minutes and email everyone on the thread that I'm working the issue but just haven't updated the case yet because I'm still working on it. It's NOT being ignored. To my knowledge, the account rep is just doing their job. So, don't think she was angry at me. In fact, I sent her a quick message on Teams to tell her that I'm calling the third party as requested. While we chatted, she mentioned that the customer updated the third party software on Thursday and only now do they consider it an emergency and have submitted a case. So, it's not just one day of missing data. It's three.

I then called Debbie. She explained to me that the issue is not with the transmission of data. They're getting the data from our software. The problem is that the new version of their software only allows 15 characters for a phone number where they used to have a maximum of 20 characters. The phone numbers we are sending are 18 characters and that is keeping their software from processing the data files.

(Note: Yes, this is the US and yes, phone numbers are 10 digits (including area code). But we send ""(111)222-3333CHome"" for instance. That's 18 characters. The interface engine hasn't been updated in a long long time, so yeah, it could be better but I didn't write the code.)

So, they changed their software to accept fewer characters. Didn't tell the customer this before go-live. And now, for some reason, it's up to us to fix it.

As of now, I've made the only change I can to shorten the phone numbers. The 'CHome' part is no longer appended to the number, so that's within their limit. Our software doesn't have a lot of customization of the data, so it's lucky I could do that. New appointments are being accepted. And I resent the appointments created since Thursday, so all the missing data is there on the third party's system.",1,1628028517

2276,We're a multi-billion dollar enterprise. We know better than you do. (Hint: no. you don't),"Posting here for the first time in a while, mostly because I want to tell this story.

&amp;#x200B;

Background: A certain large healthcare company ($vendor) offered to migrate us from our on-prem deployment of their software to their environment for a reasonable rate. We agreed because the on-prem server was getting close to retirement, and we were going to migrate them to either a VM or an AWS server soon anyway. There's been no issues with the software or the database itself, and I'm actually quite happy with how it turned out. 

&amp;#x200B;

Main Story

&amp;#x200B;

Where the problem was, was with our interface. See, we have a single practice management software ($PM) that ties together our large, multi-specialty practice and the various EHRs our doctors use to keep their records. The idea is that the $PM is the primary patient database and the EHRs pull data and schedules from it via standard HL7 interfaces. For those not familiar with them, an HL7 interface's messages usually take one of two forms: a text file created by one system and read by another or a message sent by one system to an IP address and port, where another system reads it. Pretty simple, and its what connects the world of healthcare tech. 

&amp;#x200B;

While $vendor was hosted on-prem, a file based interface was pretty easy to accomplish. $PM sends files to a folder on a file server, and $vendor reads them from there. With a server that's not hosted on site, $vendor's people decided that the best thing to do would be to build a VPN tunnel and push the HL7 data to their server via that. Now, we've built out interfaces with outside partners before, primarily to accomplish getting data to and from the labs that test our specimens for us. I've run these projects not once, but half a dozen times in the last 2 years. We tend to do this by sending the message files to our FTP server and having the other party read them from there via SFTP. It's efficient, HIPPA compliant, and I haven't had a single complaint about it in the 7 years we've been doing this.

&amp;#x200B;

But no. $vendor INSISTED. They fought tooth and nail to get it set up via VPN because to them, that's the easiest way get an interface up and running. So the $PM rep and I decided to try it despite our misgivings. We got a network engineer to setup a site-to-site VPN tunnel on our firewall, tested it to make sure we could connect to $vendor's server, a process that took almost a week due to difficulties getting the $vendor to communicate with the network engineer and went ahead with the migration as planned. We then spent the next two days troubleshooting the HL7 interface because despite messages going out from our end, the $vendor wasn't recieving them. After two days of back and forth, with $vendor's people insisting everything was good on their end (despite us being able to ping their server's IP, telnet their port, and even packet tracing to make sure the HL7 messages were actually leaving our server), I ended up reciveing a message from their lead that basically ammounted to ""actually, we don't know what's wrong and want to do this via SFTP."" Well la-di-frickin-da. 20 minutes later, I have the FTP configured for them and our $PM has set about reconfiguring the interface to actually do its job. 

&amp;#x200B;

Tl;dr: vendor wants things done their way. Clients knows a way that works for them. Turns out, the client's right.",1,1628020445

2278,Some Like It Hot,"This story is short, but sweet.

My IT department benefits from having both a front-facing customer desk as well as a back office for hands and feet.  I'm manning the front desk one crisp winter day when an accountant brings in her laptop for support. I greet her as she comes in and she has a noticeable Latin accent (important for later) But her English is excellent so it's not like I'm having trouble understanding her.

 She explains that she's having issues with her PC shutting off randomly while she's working.  I ask how often and she describes it happening every half hour or so.  Hmm, unusual but not unheard of.  So assuming it's some kind of hardware issue I start troubleshooting by running diagnostics, but they come back fine. Whatever, I have her login and try to replicate what she was doing when it last crashed. Time passes and... nothing.  I'm stumped, everything seems to be working as intended.  So we chalk it up to the ghost in the machine being on a smoke break.  

I send her off with the instructions to give me a call should it start acting up again.  sure enough, bout a half an hour later She sends out the SOS.  At this point I'm fairly certain there's something wrong with her setup. I get her desk location and let her know not to touch anything because I'm on my way.  I get to her office and when she lets me I noticed the air seems considerably warmer even though the heat is on for the entire building.  I just write it off as the cubicles being close to a vent or something and move to put a steading hand on her desk so I can lean under to take a look at the outlet.

MISTAKE!

The cubicle desk is surprisingly hot!  I sort of recoil in surprise (which also startled the customer) and bend my knees a bit to try and get another look under the hood. Yep sure enough she's got a personal heater on full blast right underneath her setup! I asked her about it, turns out this lady is from Brazil and our Midwestern Winters are just driving her insane!  I explained to her the amount of heat was likely too much for the CPU and was probably causing The computer to shut down because of it. Trying to be sympathetic I suggested moving the heater out from underneath the desk for now and maybe getting some cheap risers to keep the computer above the desktop since she was working with a docking station anyway.

She swings by later to let us know that moving the heater seemed to resolve the problem.  No word on whether or not she went with the elevated PC suggestion though.",1,1627994746

As most of our clients don't have a clue about computers, they tend to ring us even though we just support the software, we help them as much as possible though.

One day though I received a call from a very clever user who should really have known better. We also supplied this guys PC a few years ago.

He rang up to question why his PC had all of a sudden turned off. My first thought as it was an older PC would be a possible PSU issue but no, it was worse...

As the call went on we tried as much as possible to try and boot it up but in the end it was not having it.

The guy mumbled something about his laptop still working but I didn't register that at the time.... (Fatal error)

I then asked the guy to have a look under the desk and make sure that all of the cables were plugged in correctly.

He then replied 'I'll try but I can't see a lot as all of the lights are off, we had a power cut 15 minutes ago. I'll go get a torch'.

At this point I didn't know whether to laugh or cry.

Whatever they needed wasn't urgent, so they had already left when I came and found the source of problem. Two engineers put USB cable into Ethernet port and didn't question it even when it kept falling out, just put a notepad under it to keep it in place.

2284,"Yo dawg, I heard you like surge protectors...","I work as a sysadmin for my county. I started this job not too long ago and haven't been around to every location so I may have new stories under my belt before too long. Today's story is about one of my users' in an admin position.

Today this user called me and alerted me to them having issues with their set up. For most of the county, our users' are using a bigname brand laptop hooked up to a fancy little dock station with two display port monitors that are also from bigname brand. It's actually a sweet set up and allows users' to easily work from home because they can just disconnect the laptop and be on their way.

The user told me that their laptop would randomly freeze up, the dock would turn off, and their displays would go to sleep. No big deal I thought, maybe there's a firmware update that needs to be pushed through and hopefully fix the problem or we just need to swap a cable out or just restart the machine. Nothing major I assumed. 

So I go on a nice brisk walk over there from our department and greet user, who shows me the problem. I note that they had actually described said problem in full detail (yay!). I immediately go to restart the machine first. It goes down and comes back up fine and it seems to be working fine. During this period the user and I are talking about our day and what we did over the weekend when it suddenly hits the fritz again and wigs out in front of me. At this point it definitely seems to be behaving like an issue with power going to the dock, or the dock itself. I ask her to let me back into her area and where it's plugged into and she shows me. 

This is where the horror began. Her dock and monitors were plugged into ye olde beige surge protector. For the sake of this, we'll call it $surge protector 1. The warm orange light indicating its function was not on so I traced the cord to a small compartment area under the right side of her desk, behind the drawer. Inside this compartment, was another surge protector(2). You may already have your hands approaching your face but, there's still more. I noticed there's another multi-pack $surge protector(3) under there too that is ALSO connected to $surge protector 2. $Surge protector 3's main job was to connect the power from the printer... that's right above it. Yes, I too have no idea why this is needed. The power cord was obviously long enough to connect to $surge protector 2. 

In an effort to undo this mess, I decide to tace $surge protector 2's cord and see where the heck that's going (there's lots of shelving in this office where the cables are routed behind). Well, it turns out $surge protector 2 is connected to an *extension cord*. Now, I am by no means an electrical engineer but not only am I sure that connecting two surge protectors together is a bad idea, let alone three, I'm pretty sure you're not supposed to use an extension cord for a surge protector either. Alas, as I am wrapping my head around this, I continue my search for where this journey ends. I end up moving a couple of shelves and find a horrific conclusion. $surge protector 2's extension cord is plugged into... ANOTHER FREAKIN' $SURGE PROTECTOR (4)! 

At this point my feeble brain is trying to peace together this monstrosity of a system and trying to clean it up to the best of my ability. I remove $surge protector 3 from the equation entirely, along with $surge protector 4 as the extension cord could easily make it to the outlet that $surge protector 4 was connected to. However, due to cord lengths, desk orientation, etc... I was only able to configure it so:

$surge protector 1 &gt; $surge protector 2 &gt; extension cord to outlet. This still made me uncomfortable and I requested the user to notify facilities IMMEDIATELY to get new outlets installed in her office and to notify me when they do. In the meantime, she said she'd happily work off just her laptop and a charger connected directly to the outlet in the meantime. 

TL;DR: User had a surge protector jungle because they didn't want to task facilities with installing much needed outlets.

The events that unfolded made me feel quite literally like my heart would burst and my head started aching with a sort cold rage. So, I shall be working for company A, and the other shall be company B.

Client contacts me, saying that they lost their \*document\* and just applied for a replacement(at the site of company B). The two issues are that the tracker says it happened 90+ days ago and so cant be tracked, and that the fee was 28 arbitrary units of money for some reason. Alright, first things first the tracker is just wrong, mostly because this site was made by company B, which is just about the worst IT company ever, in the history of the universe.(So bad that I, at company A, have to inform them as to what their services do and how they work, when I ask for help with fixing them...)

The bigger issue is the fee. 28 is a familiar number, so I check. Yep, it used to be 28, but the law changed it at the start of this year, to 8.5. I even checked with the head of the department who are in charge of knowing this specific thing, and she agreed as well. Alright, two possibilities is a single glitch, or worse but entirely possible considering that company B is involved, they did not notice the change in the laws that their services must observe, they did not update it, and they have been more than triple charging people for half a year now, and this is the first time someone brought it up... 

Alright, I can handle this.... reassure the client, ask them to send in the data so we can haver this investimagated and fixed. Great. Not half an hour passes and I am contacted by a (very reliable and knowledgeable) colleague, who asks me to check out an email. I assumed I messed something up, so I check. Nope. Its the email from the client. Some guy who I never even heard of, sent out an answer saying that the guy in the chat was wrong, and it is 28... The client even replied, thanking him, and noting how I was wrong in the chat then. Just in case, I ask, and colleague confirms that no, I was correct. The colleague who made the mistake is apparently a hire so new, I have never even seen his name before. I have no idea what the hell he was even doing, handling that email, as it was not even part of his skillset...

I am... rather miffed, to say the least. Fine, the client sent a duplicate. I am busy right now, but transfer that over to my main skillset, I'll get to it ASAP. Just in case, add a note explaining that 8.5 is the correct value, and it has to be forwarded to Company B. Not 5 minutes pass when I check, just in case... The contact has been answered, with a nonsense answer(that I already correctly answered in the chat, btw...) by the same guy. At this point, I was more than a bit miffed... 

Not only is some complete noob, who probably only plans to stick around as a summer job, questioning my competence, he is also not even bothering to read the available email templates that show he is wrong. Or the information database we have that would also show it. Or even the contact history, to see what was discussed in the chat, *or* *even* to notice that he has already answered this exact email... Or just... you know... ask someone to make sure... No shame in that...

Our campus network group was struggling with security and was implementing various fixes, including complex ACLs at the network boundary.

I checked with the network guys and finally got someone who explained they were trying to implement an ACL for port 25, but our mail server should be allowed.  I explained what I was seeing, they agreed to check into it, but they were ""just testing"".  For the next week or so the interruptions would randomly happen, I would call them to complain, they would apologize.  I requested numerous times that they notify me any time they were testing so I could give them instant feedback that their ACL was broken, and help keep my users off my back.  I couldn't get them to agree to this, but hey, I tried.

The incidents tapered off after a while so I figured they had figured it out, or maybe given up.  Then one Saturday one of my more vocal users called me at home.  He was not receiving external email.  I SSH in start poking around, I can see we are not getting traffic from outside, and it looks like we haven't since the previous night.  I call the ""emergency"" number for network problems.  Tech calls me back but he has nothing to do with the ACLs, he's there in case there's a major outage or something similar.  I discuss with him, he takes my home number and says he'll escalate.  I say fine.   I get a call, pretty quickly, from the main networking guy (MNG).  I tell him what I'm seeing:

MNG:  ""I want to be clear that this issue has nothing to do with our ACL""

me:  ""I'm not saying it is, I'm saying it \*looks like\* the ACL, but maybe its something else""

MNG:  ""Okay as long as we're clear on that""

me: ""maybe you could disable the ACL for a second to see if anything changes""

MNG:  ""Its not the ACL, I'm not going to do that""

I'm tailing my mail logs in one terminal window while I poke around, I can hear him typing in the background.   Every once in a while he asks if anything changes, I tell him no.  After about five minutes he stops asking me if I've seen any change, its all quiet on the phone.   Suddenly I see my mail logs show traffic from outside.  

me:  ""Hey, it looks like its OK, let me check"".  

I send myself email from an outside account and it gets delivered to my Dept account!

me:  ""Hey, thanks MNG, looks like its fixed!  That's great!   What did you do?""

&lt;pause&gt;

MNG:  ""I disabled the ACL""

me:  ""can we leave it disabled until Monday?  When was it turned on anyway?""

MNG:  ""ACL guy turned it on Friday night, he didn't want to disturb folks during business hours""

me:  ""maybe testing should be done \*during\* business hours?  Just in case?""

MNG:  ""Yeah.  I'll talk to him""

MNG sounded kind of depressed but I was just happy to have the problem solved.  MNG was one of the most responsive and capable people on campus so there was not point in doing a ""superior dance"", he felt bad enough about the incident.

It took me a while to get the whole story, the ACL in question was apparently huge and they were entering it all on a command line.  Very easy to make a mistake, at least that was the reason they gave me.  It was clear they needed a better tool than a switch ACL.  I think they were able to get funding for a real high bandwidth firewall after this.",1,1627850471
2298,"People are very, very, stupid, and I want to scream.","On the bottom floor of my building, there is a storeroom with a number pad lock on its door.  
 It has large oval shaped buttons, with a line between the two numbers, so the buttons look like this:

7|8        Enter     9|0

1.

Me: ""...What?""

Me: ""...It. It's not thirty-two thirty-two. It's *three two three two.*  


L: ""Well there's none of *that* either!""  


I proceeded to have to go down and physically show her how it worked. Twice.   


L: ""Well that's stupid. It's unnecessarily confusing. I'm going to submit a complaint.""  


Me: ""You do that.""  


2.  


Man: ""Hey the pad's broken or something. The code doesn't work.""  


Me: *Here we fucking go.* ""Did you input *all four numbers* and then press the *enter* key afterwards?""  


Man: ""**Yes!** I'm not stupid you know.""  


Me: *I really, really doubt that.* ""Try it one more time while on the phone with me. I'd rather not go down if I don't have to.""

2299,"""can't you make my computer stop smoking???""","Not my story but my brother's.

So a long time ago we worked together at a call center that outsourced for a major shipping company (has brown trucks, three letter initials). We provided tech support for the shipping software the company had created. 

There were two versions: one was for light volume shippers (small businesses, etc) but had to use their own PCs. The other was for high volume shippers and we supplied the PCs and on site tech support if we couldn't fix it over the phone. These supplied computers ran Windows 3.11 so yeah, old school.

One day my brother gets a call from a high volume shipper. I sat near him, so I could get the gist of the call.

Shipper: my computer won't stop smoking, there's smoke pouring out of it.

Bro: sorry this is happening, we'll send out a ticket to get field support to replace it 

Shipper: NO! I know there's a command you can enter on the PC to make it stop smoking. You will tell me now!

Bro: I'm sorry sir there is no command you can type in to make a computer stop smoking.

Needless to say this back and forth went on for another TEN minutes. My brother was annoyed so to shut him up he hatched a clever plan.

 In Windows 3.11 you can alter it's state by adding commands to files autoexec.bat and others. This can be used to startup programs or prevent them from starting when the computer reboots. You can stop these commands by typing ""rem"" before it,so it tell Windows to ignore the particular command. So here is what my brother does.

Bro: okay sir, you're not supposed to know this trick so I need to swear you to secrecy. Can you be discreet about this?

Shipper: yeah, yeah, just tell me.

Bro: okay. If you go into autoexec.bat and type ""rem c:\nosmoke.exe then reboot, it will stop the computer from smoking.

Shipper agrees to do this but ends the call as the PC was on the other side of his building.

My brother and I have a good laugh, calling it a 1D10T error. As luck would have it though, five minutes later the call center gods blessed my brother by getting the same shipper back on the phone at random. My brother recognizes the guys voice instantly.

Bro: thank you for calling (shipping company name) this op brother, how can I help you?

Shipper: yeah we spoke earlier about my computer smoking? Yeah it's still smoking so send out the tech.

Bro: I'd be happy to, sir.

My brother sent the ticket, and concluded the call. Needless to say we had never laughed so hard. I have more from this place, but that will be for another day.",1,1627783591

2303,20 or so years ago. I accidentally broke a schools brand new chat email server.,"In the year 2001 my high school started using a new email and chat server. It was an online only school. I was playing around with the new program. While poking around. I found that normally. you can only send a chat or email request. to one person at a time. That's how it was supposed to work. But I found that you could select all with CTRL + A worked in the program . So I selected all and it worked. It then asked if I wanted to send. Either a email or a  chat request. Same thing happened CTRL + A worked, both options selected. I hit enter... Then it happened. it sent a chat request and an email request to everyone. all teachers staff and students.  Then when people started adding to the chat. When that person hit OK. It sent another email to everyone. A few minutes later. the chat program stopped and crashed. My parent got a call from the school. Apparently what I did. started a tidal wave of email. that bounced around never stopping. They had to reboot the server and reset everyones email from backup.

They later called my parent again. asking us to come in to the admin building. I thought I was going to be In so much trouble. But there was no trouble at all. they just asked me to show exactly what and how I did it. after I showed it a few times. they were satisfied and said I can go home. On the way out the principal said please don't ever do it again. They did eventually get it patched.

2304,The definition of insanity,"I actually have a tech repair shop role so I no longer am tech adjacent like I have been in my previous posts. 

\*insert level up graphic and sound effect here\*

So the place I now work at repairs mostly phones but we also do a bit of everything. Enter the customer who is the literal definition of insanity: doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results. I'll call him PicNick or PN for short. 

So PN comes in on a busy morning about two weeks ago when I'm working on checking people in. Anyway, he explains he is getting popups/adware on his phone(Which, in my opinion takes skill. Its not a particularly useful or helpful skill but it is a talent and mildly impressive). I am new(I will officially have worked here for a month on this upcoming Monday), so I forget to get the unlock passcode, and this particular type of phone doesn't prompt me for that in the check in process.  Anyway I tell him it will be a couple hours, and we will call back when we have news/a quote. Two things to know about Nick. 

1. He likes to talk. Because I am female I believe he was more polite and because it was at the beginning of this saga he actually lets me get in the words I need to understand what the problem is and check him in.
2. He's an older gentleman who very much gives off the I don't like change vibe. 

At this point none of us know what a saga this will be. Unfortunately it turns out we need to factory reset his phone but if we get his passcode we may be able to help transfer his data first. PN refuses to give us the passcode and comes to pick it up we we can not do anything. Usually after some patient explaining most folks understand and either leave to go get a new phone, take it to get the data and bring it back to reset, or just leave empty handed. Not this guy.

Over the next day or so PN calls

The company that makes his phone, his carrier, I think the store that rhymes with west guy or something like that(I was off for those two days), and basically shouts and is a belligerent, unfriendly, pushy delight to all three. The big box store actually resets and then restores the phone but whatever caused the adware to appear in the first place is reinstalled so same issue. Nick calls again the next day I am  in and my boss, very patiently, explains that the phone needs to be factory reset, and cannot have all the apps restored for the above mentioned reason. 

Rinse and repeat the above for the next week and a half. With varying reiterations of you need to factory reset it, different coworkers either saying they will stay late or come in on their days off to help him reset it, and others listening to at least half an hour tirades about the issues and what to do. I think a couple of the calls were like two hours of this guy rambling. Basically we are pretty much done with Nick because he will not do what we told him to do, and we are done with him at all three area locations.

**BUT WONDER OF ALL WONDERS:** he actually brought it in Thursday evening to one of the other locations to get it factory reset.

Normally this is where the story would end; said other local location even blacklisted him after they reset it. But oh no. Between the saga of phone calls in which he continues to ask what to do, gets the same answer, and not do it, he had changed carriers. Which now results in his phone no longer connecting to the network. It sometimes happens that way and there is legit nothing anyone can do. Particularly with the carrier he switched to. I am too new to know why this particular carrier is special but it's something I've been warned about.

So cue this gem of a conversation I overheard today while I was in the back repairing a screen under the watchful eye of the aforementioned boss(Still learning so he answers questions/gives me help and tips as I work on said phone). 

&gt;Boss: Thank you for calling ""Store Name"", what can I help you with today?  
&gt;  
&gt;PN: Hi, I'm calling because my phone no longer wants to connect to the network, and your other location must be very busy because I can't get ahold of anyone there. (blacklisting means he can still call and leave messages but it doesn't ring in this case)  
&gt;  
&gt;Boss: Ah yes, I think I recognize your voice. Unfortunately if the factory reset doesn't fix that issue, like you did yesterday, then there is nothing we can do.  
&gt;  
&gt;PN: But I like this phone. Its been a good phone up until the adds started popping up. It works well for me and they went away last night, but now it won't connect to the network. Can't you fix it?  
&gt;  
&gt;Boss: \*Places on speaker so he can help me with something as he chats to Nick\* I understand, but as I said before there is nothing we can do. You need to get a new phone through your new carrier.

And rinse and repeat for about 5-10 minutes in which Nick basically says the exact same thing in different phrasing. Meanwhile, all of us are attempting not to laugh because ye gods he keeps going on and on and we have been dealing with him for two weeks now. Eventually the boss gets DONE and falls completely silent and eventually the guy says okay bye and hangs up. PN would have continued forever if he hadn't done that.  Cue everyone laughing at his ridiculous mannerisms and praising said boss's clever way of hanging up/""dropping"" the call. AND we still aren't done for:

* My boss's manager/manager of the three local stores including our own calls shortly after and instructs my boss to blacklist him at this store. Also to let my boss vent. 
* PN actually makes an appointment for later on. We obviously decline it.
* Those messages he kept leaving at the first store that blacklisted Nick? They are, for all we know, in morse code. I think we got busy and had to stop trying to translate before we could plug it into something to figure out what the knocks meant. I'll edit if they mean anything.

So yeah, this is where the saga ends for now. Will edit if it develops further, but I think he's blacklisted in all three locations so he would have to come in physically to continue to complain and ramble our ears off.

2306,Attempt at Ticket Stat Padding Leads to Egg on Face,"This story is from several years ago, back in my IT help desk days.  I was reminded of this by an unrelated thread in another subreddit and thought I would share it here.

I used to work in an IT help desk job with someone who was a bit of a bully.  He'd do petty stuff like take my keyboard and either replace it with his dirty one (keyboards he used over time always became disgusting) or he'd just leave me with no keyboard.  This guy was also the lowest performing member of our office, by far.  Everything we did for users was documented in our ticketing system; our boss (who was awesome) said it was important to document our usefulness.  So, when you looked up our stats, it was obvious who was performing and who wasn't.  

In our ticketing system, we had a bunch of old tickets that had been self-resolved by users that were still flagged as ""open"" but we all knew they were no longer in need of attention.  Whenever we, the help desk workers, would resolve an issue we'd close the ticket as ""resolved"" after having first assigned it to ourselves.  If a user ended up not needing help anymore, we could just cancel the ticket without assigning it first.  I'm not sure why the tickets in question in this story were never cancelled out, but our boss asked us to go through them and cancel them if they no longer required our attention.  We all knew that we were to CANCEL them, not assign them to ourselves and mark them as RESOLVED.  We all knew the difference between the two.

This guy decided to assign dozens of these tickets to himself in one day, assign them to himself, and mark them as resolved.  I saw this happening from within our ticketing program.  He later made a comment about how his resolved tickets for the week were above the office average, as if he had been helping a ton of users.

Sun Tzu wrote that, when an adversary is making a mistake, you should be careful not to interrupt them.  The bully apparently didn't know something that I did know: Each RESOLVED ticket has a 1/3 chance of sending the user a survey.  So, dozens of users were sent surveys asking them about the job this guy did helping them with an issue he never actually helped them with.  Our boss then received dozens of emails from confused users.  This all played out just as I knew it would the moment he started bullshitting all of those tickets.

This is how the office bully got egg on his face.",1,1627665744

I was working with a lady, troubleshooting Citrix Desktop on a personal computer while at home. I was a little hamstringed going into things because our workplace tends to use company computers that I can always remote into, ping, troubleshoot much more accurately. But we also dig the whole ""work from anywhere with any device"" model. 

That said, I did my best and we eventually got her squared away. Toward the end of our conversation she mentioned that I sounded like her son and asked for my age. I told her that I'm 24 and she paused for a moment, apologized, and said that he was 25 and passed away last year due to aggressive leukemia. He was her personal at-home IT guy, moreover he was her son. She felt like, for one last time, he was helping her figure things out and talking her through the steps.

2308,When the user is smart enough to configure a firewall but not smart enough to know how it works,"The company I do desktop support for has two VPN connections.
One is for a work supplied device which gives them full functionality and the other is a split system tunnel connection on their own personal device that allows them to RDP to a device on the LAN

Recently due to COVID and the influx of people working from home, we have started doing support for personal devices and connecting to them to the VPN and RDP

99% of them have been due to their firewall blocking the RDP port. I get that most people have no idea and need help allowing it through

I had one caller who was a nice lady and put me on to her partner as he is my computer literate

Me: Hi, what issue are you having? 
Him: we are able to connect to the VPN but cannot RDP or connect to the PC at her office

I checked and the work device is online, ping able etc 

Me: no problem, I can connect in with logmein to see your device and see what is happening 

Him: nope that won't work. My router will block it

Me: are you sure? I can at least try and see if it works 

Him: no it won't work! I have set up and configured my VIP reception firewall so I know what is allowed in and out. My firewall will block it. 

*thinking to myself* logmein uses port 443 so I am very sure he hasn't blocked that! 

Me: OK so in my experience it's most often a firewall issue. Cam you disable your firewall for just a minute and test it? 

Him: no I am not doing that. It's not a firewall issue. I can connect to other devices fine

Me: other devices? You're able to connect with the remote desktop app? 

Him: no team viewer. I can use teamviewer fine so it can't be a firewall problem! 

Me: OK well teamviewer uses a different port than remote desktop so it's possible that it is just blocked. All you have to do is disable it for a minute and tell me if it connects! 

This went on for a few minutes and before I gave up

Me: if you don't want to do any testing I am afraid I can't help you any further. We provide limited support for your own devices. 

Him: OK fine I have just turned it off and will show you that it still doesnt work

A few seconds pass...

Him: OK that is weird it connects now. What have you done? 

Me: nothing from my end, it was just your network blocking the connection 

I gave him the default RDP number port and he added the rule in his firewall. no issues once he turned it  back on

Him: great thanks for your help.

2310,Just to be on the safe side ...,"Back when RAM was much more expensive than it is now, an application administrator was dealing with a performance issue. After investigation, he concluded that the problem was a memory shortage on the VM hosting it. He estimated what the application would need, adding a little bit on the top to be on the safe side. He then talked to the team lead, saying we need this much extra RAM.

The TL then talked to the project manager and asked for extra RAM, adding a little bit to the application admin's figure - just to be on the safe side.

The PM then talked to the OS support guy (me) and asked for extra RAM, adding a little bit to the TL's figure - just to be on the safe side.

I  added some RAM to the VM - with a bit extra over the PM's figure, just to be on the safe side.

A while later, the application admin and I were comparing notes and discovered that what he'd been given was way more than he'd asked for - and realised every step in the chain had added a bit extra. I'm a bit fuzzy on the details now - it's been a while. But I think the numbers were something like: application needed 6GB, VM got 11GB.",1,1627593789
2311,Let's Make A Plan and Start Calling For Buy-in,"To give some background.. A year ago my leader mentioned that he would like to transition off an inherited SSO implementation to Azure SSO in the next three years. FFWD to 5/3/21, three months ago, our SSO account rep reaches out and reminds us of the upcoming renewal due 7/30/21. With COVID we've been cutting back on annual expenses and want to save the money, so my leader said cutover by that date. 

72 configured applications for 25 different systems with 21 different user groups and requiring 90% or higher company-wide Microsoft MFA enrollment was my self-defined success criteria. With how slow healthcare IT is for changes.. impossible, right? Fuck it, let's make a plan and start calling for buy-in.

I draft up a simple cutover plan, listing which apps on what dates grouped by tier, user group and expected complexity. Also write down who I need on as my A-Team, and who I need buy-in from.

So I start calling up my fellow system admins. Conversations went like this ""My leader wants to switch to Microsoft SSO by 6/30, I need you on-board. I'll handle all change control, cutover config, communication, and support; just need your buy-in."" ""That's a pretty aggressive timeline, but if you can do it, let's do it."" Cool, I've got the sysadmins on-board. 

Time to call second-tier business owners. HR, Pharma/Healthcare admins, and such. Conversations go like ""I've done some math, our SSO system costs the company 500k a year on employee-login time, renewal, server time and support. We are switching SSO providers, and are not renewing. If you'd like your application login to still function, I need you to agree to X timeline."" ""What do I need to do?"" ""I'll handle it all, just need your written buy-in."" Cool, I've got the second-tier owners on board.

Last calls of that day were to my A-team. The service desk manager, architect and IT marketing guy. All on-board.

The next day, for completeness I setup a call with a VAR to see if they could handle the project. They sold us the original SSO product, and tout their M365 expertise all the time. The conversation was sub-par, and the quote for the work was two years of the renewal cost.. Yeah, if the project didn't complete we could ""blame them"", but that is a mindset for the weak. This is the point where I knew we had to handle all in-house.

Over the next weeks it was documentation, CCB, implementation, and scripting.

With all healthcare systems, we have many regulations and bureaucratic hoops to deal with. Authentication is a major part of non-repudiation, so I had to comb through all our audited procedures and get them updated. Thankfully I was able to delegate some of that work.

Change control went smooth except for the first one. The manager of IT Project Managers pipped up when I was explaining the breadth of this project, its effects, and timeline. Long story short, they didn't like that I didn't request a PM that was going to have no idea what to do, and that we didn't have a vendor to fall back on ""to blame"".

Implementation was all smooth, even for applications used by every employee. I tell you what.. the technical gymnastics I implemented to make a smooth HR cutover was a proud moment. The hiccup is when we got to the MFA required applications. Remote access.

This whole time, my A-team had been communicating to end users about the cutover, and the requirements around MFA. Handling any and all issues, and providing exceptional support. Week 1, jump from 1% to 40% enrollment. Week 2-5, up to 50%. We needed 90% MFA enrollment by week 7. I had built a script to help visualize enrollment, and create a distro of those not enrolled. So day after day we blast those who haven't enrolled, communicating procedure and deadline. 

Week 7 we are at 75%. Thank god week 8 wasn't the actual deadline! I've still got 4 weeks to get this done. 

Week 8 - these people just don't want to enroll; pushed my timeline back for remote access apps. Time to alert their managers. Modify my script to pull their manager too. Write a new script to blast an email to the managers detailing % of their team enrolled, and name those who haven't enrolled. 85% enrollment.

Week 9 - working for the last 5%, and I start 2 weeks of PTO next week (why I wanted an 8 week implementation). Blast another email to the managers warning them of potential work-stoppage, and the people specifically. Managers were obviously not happy with their employees. Jumped to 96% enrollment. Time to cutover.

Week 10 - I'm going on PTO y'all. Bout time to document and have our first official meeting. We set responsibilities, walk through what is left, who to talk to and how to implement, passed mostly to my architect. As expected, implementation hiccups.

Week 11 - Fixing hiccups and standing up some internal architecture for Citrix.

Week 12 - Full remote access SSO+MFA implementation. The 4% not enrolled are mad, but they had months of warning. 

Week 13 - Everything is done, and we the sysadmins are happy. HR was surprised it went so smooth, and our CIO and CISO is over the moon about the SSO implementation.

&amp;#x200B;

With what I have been reading here and the little experience I have of being the most tech literate person in an office, I know IT is usually very busy and so I try to handle things myself whenever I can.

This story is about the new job I started a week ago. I received my laptop on the first day, and have only been in contact with IT a few times about accounts etc. The thing about our office is that there aren't assigned desks. Rather, there are monitors on desks where you can sit down and connect your laptop. And that's what I've been doing for the past week. Sit down, find the USB-C cable coming from the monitor, connect it to my laptop.

The problem I've noticed fairly quickly is that my laptop charger's a USB-C cable also. So you see, if my laptop battery is low, I have to disconnect from the wide monitor and suffer with the small screen while it charges. I've been trying to mitigate this issue by charging my phone during breaks or before work, but alas I had to suffer the laptop screen nevertheless.

So today I figured I'd ask IT for an HDMI cable that I'd carry with me from desk to desk so I could charge my computer while connecting to the monitors with HDMI. Simple enough. I created a ticket and explained it as such. Very quickly I received a reply that the cable was waiting for me at IT.

On my first break I went to IT, asked for my cable. They asked a few questions about the monitors I was using and I answered as much as I could remember. Then they gave a cable with USB-C on both ends, saying that it'd charge my computer while connected to the monitor with it. I was super excited, thanked them a bunch and went back to my desk.

Still excited, I checked around the monitor at the desk for a USB-C port and couldn't find one. Luckily there was an IT person working on the desk across me and I asked if they could help me. Thankfully they came over to check the monitors and found that neither had a USB-C port. I explained what went down in IT and they said for charging from the monitor, I needed one of the newer monitors.

Then we checked a few desks together, connecting my laptop to the screens to if it would charge. They didn't. As we were both surprised that it didn't work, I explained why I needed the cable in the first place and said maybe I should go get an HDMI instead. They asked why didn't I have the charger for the laptop and need to charge from the monitor.

I said ""I got the charger. The problem is the port. My charger is a USB-C, the monitors connect with USB-C. There's only one USB-C.""

They looked at me a moment and asked why I didn't connect them both.

I said the same stuff again, pointing to the one USB-C port on my computer. They looked at me a moment longer and pointed next to it.

There was a Thunderbolt port right next to the USB-C charging one... I was still confused when they plugged the monitor USB-C there. 

With all my surprise I apologized a bunch for taking their time and thanked a lot for helping me. As they were taking the cable I got back to IT, I asked them to explain my stupidity to the IT desk as well.

I'm a bit ashamed because the first thing I did with my computer was to get the user manual and read it to familiarize myself with it. Apparently I had missed about the Thunderbolt port and that you can plug USB-Cs there... Needless to say I've been using both ports very happily.",1,1627573352

2320,Supervisor broadcasts a client's SSN throughout the company,"This one isn't from me, it's through my dad. I can't provide too many details for obvious reasons and because I have limited experience with IT myself, but this should get the gist across.

&amp;#x200B;

My dad works in a company that primarily offers network solutions for other companies- designing their infrastructure, both software and hardware, from the ground up and providing training. It's a big enough team that while everyone who's anyone in the company has some IT experience and is decently tech literate (a huge blessing, although there are plenty of fun stories from new hires don't you worry), not everyone has practical experience with front-end software development AND hardware AND cybersecurity. And sometimes, just sometimes, a specialist or a manager in one area will goof up *bad*.

&amp;#x200B;

This particular contract was a government function- big, sensitive, and not necessarily well-organized. One of the things that needed to be stored was social security numbers, alongside other personal details. The chain of events, from my dad's perspective, was the following.

&amp;#x200B;

A low level supervisor who had been asked to help with a particular user's issue, was struggling and emailed several other supervisors. To specify who they were trying to help, *of course,* the email contained the user's SSN. Oh boy. Obviously their boss spotted the flaw with this particular inspired bit of communication, and was certain to shut it down reminding all the supervisors in the company not to share a client's personal info over email. The boss, uh, did this over email, and forwarded the original email as an example of what not to do. Guess what the boss also failed to do?

&amp;#x200B;

Yes, that's right. The email chain going out to every supervisor in the company contained highly personal secure information of a client. Obviously some people noticed the flaw here as well, and in relatively short order they went to the internal IT department, of which my dad is a member, and asked them to scrub all mentions of this client's personal info from their email server. They did this by filing a ticket. And hey, guess which bit of data was also included *in the ticket itself and needed to now be redacted from there too*. If you guessed someone's highly sensitive personal data from a government database, you are today's lucky winner!

&amp;#x200B;

The series of blunders needed to make that happen, from people who are supposed to be trained professionals, is just incredible.",1,1627496088
2321,"No, this is not Toshiba tech support","Short but sweet story here from last week. Working my on-call shift for an MSP when I get a call at 1am from our answering service saying they have a man on the phone who's having an issue with his Toshiba laptop. This raised two flags immediately.

1. We don't have any clients who use Toshiba computers
2. The answering service will usually tell us what client is calling so we can put in a ticket but they didn't know which one this was from.

The conversation, almost verbatim, went like this:

Me, still half asleep: ""Hi this is E1337Recon with $MSP, how can I help you?"" 

Guy: ""Hi, I'm having issues witb my Toshiba laptop. It's running windows 7 and I used to be able to highlight a group of pictures all at once and open them in my photo editor but now I can't do that.""

Me: ""Okay. What company are you calling from? Is this a company-issued laptop?""

Guy: ""Well I'm not really a company I'm a freelancer so I guess it's personal but I bought it for use just for my photography gigs.""

Me: ""Sir, this is $MSP. We service computers for our clients.""

Guy: ""You mean this isn't Toshiba customer support?""

Me: ""No. Goodbye.""

How this guy even got our emergency, after-hours support number is beyond me and it was certainly not the 1am wakeup call I wanted to get.

Has anyone else gotten strange, after-hours calls like that?",1,1627494250
2322,Classic case of PEBKAC,"When I got my first job in IT I worked in a team supporting a government mainframe system. Our government were just getting into the idea of external consultancies doing work because they were ""better"" than the government employees. The net result of this was we were faced with an annual intake of sparkly faced kids with degrees in geography or business studies arriving as ""consultants"" working for one of the largest global consultancies at the time. They would arrive, go through an induction for about 6 weeks, disappear to the States for a ""COBOL Programming Course"" for another 6 weeks at which point they would arrive back and you would find they were your boss.

I was saddled with one who kept calling me for somewhat spurious reasons. The one that is indelibly burned into my memory was the ""enter key not working"" issue. On this day, ${""manager""} was running some user testing on the system and the instructions were pretty clear, you filled in the test data from the script (yes there was a paper script, we are talking the late 80's here) and then you hit the action key to move to the next page. Note, the action key on this particular flavour of mainframe was where you would see the backspace key on a modern PC keyboard. The key just below this had a very different function and could be mapped in the terminal settings applied when a user logged in. 

On the particular day I had a large number of calls about an issue with one of our line printers. It was apparently spitting out endless sheets of fanfold paper with the same information on it. One of the users had fed the printer with 4 boxes of fanfold and had neatly stacked the 4 boxes of output ready for collection. I logged into the system and checked the print spool, it was full with hundreds of pending print jobs, all the same size and all tagged with ${""manager""} as the owner. I disabled printing, cleared the spool and restarted the scheduler and sure enough jobs started to be added for ${""manager""} again. Time to go and see them.

I looked round the office, spotted ${""manager""} and went over. Immediately I was told ""the mainframe is broken"", a rather odd statement to come from a ""manager"" for a global IT consultancy. You would expect a little more technical detail at least. On questioning what the issue was I was told no matter how many times the hit the enter key, nothing was happening. Everything suddenly fell in place. My next question was ""have you read the user manuals for this application?"", I knew full well they had not. In the manuals you were told that the key labelled ""action"" was the equivalent of ""enter"" on this mainframe terminal. There was also a very handy keyboard map diagram showing the action key and also telling users that the key below the action key was mapped to print screen. 

I said ""you've been printing the same screen over and over again"". This was met with a flat denial and ${""manager""} started to have a go at me in a very loud voice. Now I've never been one to take crap from anyone, especially an inept arrogant fool promoted beyond their level of ability. I turned round, went to the printers, grabbed a barrow, put the 4 boxes of wasted fanfold on the barrow, got all the additional sheets from the printer and added them to the boxes, walked back and said ""yes, you have. Here are 4 boxes of fanfold along with a number of additional sheets all screen prints from your terminal."" Their response was classic, ""how can you prove it's from my terminal"". The answer to that was very simple. Every users name was included on the printouts and it appeared on every single sheet. I took great pleasure in going through every single box pointing to their name over and over again. 

That would not be my last encounter with them, but they were shifted into a role where they had no responsibility for a team.",1,1627490829

2324,Crazy lady demands assistance with a product we don't sell,"Some random woman submitted an email ticket for help accessing her account. Ok, easy stuff. I reply, ask her her username, but can't find it in the database. She insists its correct so I ask her to send a screenshot of the error notification she's receiving. When she does, I notice she's trying to login in to some random website I've never even heard of. I have no idea how she ended up with *our* contact information. I tell her the site she's trying to access isn't a product of our company and to reach out to their customer support. I then closed the ticket. 

But alas, that's not the end. She calls in to the support line and I happen to be the one to answer the phone. After I say ""Thank you for calling *anonymous medical company*, this is *HoungryHoungryHippo*, how can I help you?"", she responds with ""is this the *HoungryHoungryHippo* who refused to help me get access to my account?"". And I immediately know this is going to be a fun call. 

She basically **insists** that its *my* job to get access to her account. My response is that its not because she's asking about a product we don't even sell. She says she's not hanging up until I help her so I relent and Google the software, find their customer support number, and attempt to give it to her. After I recite the number, she goes silent for a couple seconds, and then says ""What do I do with this? I called YOU for a reason! Why are you trying so hard to avoid doing what you get paid to do?"". I asked her what hospital she works for and I did notice that they **do** have an account with some of our products, except the product she was needing help with isn't one of ours. I tell her this and she just isn't grasping it. 

I finally get pissed off and say ""Ma'am, this is not a product we sell. There's nothing I can do aside from pass of their contact number"" and she says ""Well, we're going to sit here all day because I'm not getting off this line until I'm helped"". 

I chuckle a little to myself and hang up. 

She immediately calls back. I see it on the caller ID and decide to just let it ring for a bit to see if she gives up. I alert the other techs and after a good laugh at her expense, my manager picks up the phone. He tells her the same thing I did and again, she insists on ""being helped"". After she whines some more, he tells her there's no assistance we can offer with a product we don't sell and hangs up, again. 

That's the end of her tirade, right? 

Nope. 

She then begins spamming the chat. I closed the first one immediately and she opened a new one. I finally called the hospital she worked for and thankfully someone else picked up the phone. I asked to speak to a manager, told her what happening, and she apologized and insisted it would stop. The lady immediately quit spamming us. I hope she was immensely embarrassed when she finally realized she was an idiot calling the wrong number. Her final send off was giving me a 1/5 rating on the initial email ticket she submitted. 

Legend has it, she to this day has yet to gain access to her account.",1,1627487882

2331,Hard Drives? What Hard Drives?,"Ok, to set the scene...I work with the DoD so we have pretty strict procedures when it comes to the decommissioning of equipment.  About three months ago we receive an intern.  This intern had about six months to go (now three) on his tour of duty and decided he wanted to get into IT.  He signed up for an internship through the military and before you know it he's walking in our door eager to do the computer things.

His job was to take updates from a secure network and install them in fighter planes.  That's it.  Update goes from A to B, if there were any problems he was to contact someone else.  He has no experience in troubleshooting, desktop support, server support, IT security, no formal IT education, and with the exception of the Sec+ cert he was given years ago by the military he has no professional certifications.

At one point I was showing him a few things related to local security policy and I opened up the local users and groups mmc.  He says ""Is that the registry?""   \*facepalm\*

So...we just went through a PC migration.  A little over 100 computers were replaced with newer models and the old ones are in the process of being decommissioned.  Part of that process is removing, documenting, and destroying the hard drives of the old computers.  The hard drives had been pulled and were awaiting documentation and destruction (something we do on-site).

Today, I find a random hard drive in a drawer and ask my team lead about it.

TL: Yea, I dunno.  Hook it up to a non-network computer and see what's on it.  Maybe we can reuse it.  And while you're at it, check those other two drives in the other drawer!

Now, I work as a Help Desk Technician (contracted) for a major health insurance in a call center environment assisting internal and offshore employees with their technical issues.

If I had to choose, I would prefer to work at a more steady pace doing help desk. I miss doing help desk when I was working in higher education but the pay was just too low for me to survive off of. I enjoyed taking my time to resolve issues and working one on one with colleagues without all the performance metrics and fast paced calls.

About 2 years ago, I was working with a customer who was having some issues with our software.

As a developer, I am only called in when things are beyond normal support.

The software was failing to replicate data from the live server to the standby server.  During the initial discussions, it was determined that systems were rather out of date.
I wish I could just tell them we don't support old versions, but that's just a pipe dream, I suppose.

As we are talking about how the datastore gets replicated from one machine to the other during startup, I mention that the datastore files are copied using SCP with a superuser account using a private key.

The customer's sysadmin gets a little upset, and says ""You should NOT be using root to scp files around the network!"", 
to which I had probably the greatest support answer I have ever delivered in my life: ""Oh, no, we haven't done it that way for at least 8 years now!"".

2336,The ongoing saga of the end user vs. POS company,"Disclaimer: i am not tech support, other than i sometimes fix stuff that breaks if i can figure it out.

My most technical achievment is figuring out how our POS and store software uses .csv to import from a supplier excel file, and only because i can navigate a convoluted mess of instructions.

&amp;#x200B;

To start off with some backstory, here is what happened last year;

I work in a bookstore in COUNTRY, we sell books, stationary\\office equipment, various nick-nacks like candles, napkins, candle holders and recently a large assortment of knitting yarn and supplies. 

In all this, sometimes things end up priced wrong. And when they do we'll change the price if we catch it in the POS, then fix it on the computer in the back-end software? I lack the English vocabulary for some of this i'm afraid. 

Suddenly last year books came up on the POS with very, very wrong prices. Going from CURRENCY 349 to CURRENCY 1 million+ and no matter what we did it could not be changed in the POS machine manually, and when checked in the back-end software the prices were correct.

Through tech support we find out that for some unknown reason THOUSANDS of book titles have had what is the local equivalent of a recycling fee\\deposit added to them. In normal use this is CURRENCY 2 or 3 charged for plastic bottles and aluminium cans and returned when recycled. Unfortunately this has been applied to books, and at a sum that is not 2 or 3, but over a million per.  


And because this not a part of the price but tacked on after it can not be overridden or removed except by removing it in the back-end software and then reimporting it to the POS machine.

Our POS suppliers solution to this problem was ""well, there's yer problem right there. good luck"" and we were supplied with a massive file containing each title with this added. Now this was during mass covid hysteria and i was laid off at the time, but the people at work then spent god knows how long manually opening each EAN\\ISBN manually and unchecking this function by hand. For thousands of titles.

&amp;#x200B;

Now that was last year, this is last weekend.

I get a message from my boss who's on holiday, she's had a look at the app on her phone and it is showing that we've sold for -79 millions. I assure her i haven't handed out 79 million and can't find anything wrong, until closing time.

The end of day report is half correct. The part i use the numbers from for that day is ok, it shows seemingly the correct sale figures. But there is another half that breaks down sales by sales tax bracket, and one of them shows a figure of negative 95 million sold that day.

A mail is sent to tech support immediately, and i get a response on monday. Their response is ""we found this"" and link to a receipt. The actual sale receipt shows i sold a packet of napkins at its normal price, but looking the reipt up on the back end shows nothing but wonky numbers. More impressively when i check that item in the back-end software and it's statistics it states number of item sold as none, but sales in CURRENCY 218+ millions. So we have the culprit, and i see a potential issue at once.

There is a apostrophee in the name of it. And from experience i know a ; in the name field of a .csv file will make all ensuing lines break when you try to do a import to mass create or update wares. so perhaps that little ' is doing the same here, and because it was created manually in the software and not imported it didn't break until the first time we sold one. Cue ""Bobby Tables"" cartoon to explain the concept to my colleague.

But again their solution is either to try and annul the sale, or just document and get the accountant to work around the wonky numbers.

Now i tried to annul the sale, and it fucked up the monday as well. Their response to this is ""well, tell the accountant there was a error"". A response which i can guarantee you my boss won't be happy with, and since i'm the only regular employee not on holiday now, this is now my problem.

2337,Security Officer Breaks Security,"I worked as the tech lead in a small account of a huge corporation and I typically handled the tech support problems within our system because I was in the office and most of the other developers were off site, plus I knew everything about our system. 

One day I received a tech support call from the top manager about how our account did not have documentation of items promoted to production since the first quarter. This isn’t something I normally did, as it was in the System Administrator (SA) area, but I knew the scripts, had read only access to them, and knew how unsupported we were in that department this year (we went from a specific SA who knew our system to a revolving group team that didn’t know our system). We were starting our yearly audit with an external firm on our security procedures and all sorts of other business things. Without this audit trail, we were in deep trouble and could face some big fines. 

A little history is needed. We had finally picked up our own account security officer (aso) in charge of the standard corporate security requirements for our industry. Beforehand our small account had piggy backed off another account. This was a finding of the previous year’s audit that we didn’t have a dedicated aso. This new aso took great exception that with our very small team that I not only wrote and reviewed code, but also promoted code through the various environments. The aso thought that I was a security risk and came up with all sorts of scenarios in which I could go bad and corrupt or destroy the system in some way. It didn’t matter that a DBA or a SA had far more access and capability of destroying more than just the system, but the backup systems, logs etc. I was the one who was the danger. 

I gave the aso our written documentation on the promoting procedures and walked them through the steps and situations that had to be avoided. All this was documented. Their major concern was that I could promote my own code to production. Whenever I (or my backup) promoted anything, it was logged in our version control system who promoted what (file and version) and when. At the end of the day, an email went out with the information on what was promoted to where that day to our aso. If for some reason I had to promote my own code, I had manager approval in email that the aso was included in. I countered all their arguments and wrote the whole thing up for my top manager, including my findings that we did not have strong controls over SAs, DBAs, and most specifically, Managers who used their authority to bypass procedures. 

We had system logs showing who did what/when and those logs and backup systems were all outside our ability to manipulate etc. It was a secured system from our side of things. 

Thus, why I was surprised I had a call regarding how our account did not have documentation of items promoted to production since the first quarter. I dug in and discovered the following. 

The aso decided they still didn’t trust me. They wanted to change the end of day (EOD) script that sent email on who promoted what to include additional information that our current script didn’t have. Our revolving group team of SAs couldn’t change the script to his desires, so he found another account in our company who used a similar system and had them send their EOD script, convinced the SA of the day to replace the script without testing because it works fine in the other account, and the next day the aso went on vacation. When the aso came back, they never noticed they weren’t receiving this EOD promotion email anymore. This went on for half a year. 

I wrote a special script that crawled through our version control and for every file promoted to prod since the last audit, it showed who promoted version(s) from development up through the testing stages, including the noted details on the promotions. The report also highlighted instances of someone reporting their own code, which the noted details explained. It was easy to support that last requirement with the approval emails for those very few occasions that happened. This took care of the problem of no EOD promotion emails and became a supplemental part of our security findings each audit. 

I then happily had a meeting with the aso and top manager and explained how the aso broke protocols without any approvals, which specific items in the promotion procedure documentation that were broken, and how they bad it was and reiterated how we did not have controls in place to stop an aso or manager from going rogue or using their authority to bypass our controls. It was a good day.",1,1627404031

2339,I should have followed my instincts...,"I was assigned a ticket to install a server roof fan at a client site. It was my first time ever doing such a ticket. But no problem, I'm a capable technician that can follow instructions and look at something and determine what goes where. I get onsite, talk to the client, get the new server roof fan out the box, take off the old server roof and replace it with the new server fan. I installed the roof fan PRECISELY how it was in the diagram along with instructions. I installed it in where it fit perfectly. Now I'm not too familiar with server room fans and which way the air is supposed to blow. But after installation, the server fan was blowing out of the server, not into the server. I tell the client I'm finished but he wants to check out my work. He looks at it and says ""Hey, the air should be blowing into the server, not out of the server."" I say to the client ""I'm not so sure sir, I followed the instructions as shown here."" He is adamant that I installed it wrong, and another user walks into the room and says that I installed it wrong too. Client tells me ""Fix it right!"".....Fine...so I switched the fan around so now air is blowing INTO the server. Now he is satisfied, but then says ""Its way too loud, does it have to be this loud? Cant you turn it down?"" ""No sir, I cant. That's natural for the fan to be this loud."" He says that its unacceptable because someone will be working in the same room as the server....SO...he puts a box on top of the server to lessen the noise. ""Sir you are now blocking airflow, I would not recommend putting a box on top to lessen the noise"" ""It's fine!"" He exclaims. ""Call your manager and see if its ok to put this box on top"" Sir, I wont call because he is going to say the same exact thing I'm saying now"" (I'm definitely not calling my busy ass manager to ask if a client can put a box on top of a server fan

\-\_\_\_\_\_\_- ) So after all this I left and spoke with a senior tech about my experience. Senior tech tells me that I DID INSTALL the server fan the CORRECT way the first time around. And that air should be blowing out of the server because of ABC XYZ...Should have followed my instincts....",1,1627398819

2341,Config files stored in network shares... What could possibly go wrong?,"This tale isn't the standard tale on this sub, it's more like a confession of my own f\*up which the tech support team had to bear.

Many years ago, fresh from school, I had a temporary job in the facility management team of a spa center. Historically, our guests were old but quite fit and their residence was like a spa vacation.

For budgeting reasons in the healthcare system, our guests got sicker year after year. The time I was there, they were mostly old people recovering from hip replacement surgeries.

For (also historically) strange reasons, the facility management was responsible for organizing the arrival and departure of our guests.

Since this spa center belonged to a larger organization, our team had no electronically access to this data. Why would the janitors need this sort of access?

So our process involved a lot of annoying work including passing printed paper along and typing things in Excel tables.

&amp;#x200B;

One day, I was really bored and played around on our shared PC.

The application the organization used to schedule every appointment (including the day of arrival and departure) was preinstalled on our computer, but our account/group had no permissions to access the backend server.

I fiddled around with the settings of this application. I changed the authorization config from using active directory to asking for username and password and changed the background colors of this ugly piece of software (some sort of terminal application in its own window) to green and blue. 

All ok, this is just the installation on our computer, we wouldn't get access to the backend server anyhow, so *what could go wrong*?

&amp;#x200B;

On the next morning, I walked past a lot of familiar green and blue looking computer monitors at the reception. At least familiar to me.

When I arrived at my office, there were plenty of desperate looking emails from the tech support team in our mailbox. They informed the whole organization, that they were trying to restart the backend server for this software.

As fast as I could, I reversed every setting I made the previous day.

I had a closer look at the software and I saw what was wrong. It was installed on a network share. It wrote its config file inside this network share. Everybody in the organization had write permissions to this config file. *Everybody, including me.*

&amp;#x200B;

Two minutes later, a mail from the IT department arrived, that rebooting the server fixed this issue.

I guess they still don't know what really happened that day.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Changed some settings in a strange piece of software, settings were stored along the software itself on a network share, whole organization can't use this software the next morning and IT was desperately trying to fix this mess by rebooting the application's backend server.",1,1627345242

2347,"My mouse is ""broken""","Hello fellow techs, I work with and support an entitled User (we all know the type) who also happens to be as dense as a black hole (if she wasn't so problematic I wouldn't care). I have multiple stories about how I came to realize that she is, in fact, an idiot, but none of them felt worthy of posting but I might get around to it at some point. In general, it can be summed up with, her stupidity often forced me to do extra work that was wholly unnecessary so I resented her for obvious reasons.

I am setting up EntitledUser to work with our new bank platform, when I see her send a ticket in about how she ""*needs*"" a new wireless mouse. We send them out with all laptops for people who need to work remote to make things easier, as a kind of perk. So every single laptop we setup gets one, so naturally we're almost always out of them. We're constantly struggling to keep them in stock.

So I ask my FriendUser what the issue is, since she's in the same room assisting her. Let me be clear, I asked FriendUser first because I had a hunch that EntitledUser was going to lie directly to my face, and what do you know? 

I hate being right all the time. 

She asks the EntitledUser, who doesn't know that we're friends, what the issue is, and the info is then relayed to me that EntitledUser has decided she doesn't want to have to pick up her wireless mouse and put it in her laptop bag with her laptop to take home. She want a wireless mouse for her desk, *and* one for her bag.

I tell FriendUser, nicely, that the whole reason she has a wireless mouse and not a wired one, is so that it's easy to travel with. We *do* have a wireless mouse in stock, but sending one out just for her to have an extra defeats the entire point of her having the wireless to begin with. FriendUser bows out of being the middleman at this point, saying she agrees with my point but does *not* want to relay anymore information for me. So I thank her for giving me the honest truth and move directly to contact with EntitledUser.

Me, being the nice patient guy I am, rather than just saying, ""No your request is wholly unreasonable."", I decide to give her the chance to come clean, then offer her a solution.

""Good morning, EntitledUser, what is the issue with your current mouse?""

""It's broken, in like multiple pieces broken."" *Liar Liar pants on fire*

""Oh that's terrible! How/when did that happen? Have you been able to work at all?""

""It just happened this morning, I dropped it. I can't work and I need a new one.""

At this point, I'm done with the song and dance and clue her in that I know it's not actually broken cause I'm actively remoted into her PC, and can see her moving the mouse around. I am in *take no shit* mode cause I am underpaid and overworked and already don't like her.

""I can see your mouse moving around on your screen so it looks like it's working alright for now. FriendUser has let me know the situation with your mouse. So the wireless mice are provided with the laptops so that if the dongle is plugged directly into the laptop, it will be easy to move and travel with, if you'd like one for permanent placement in your laptop bag, I can send you an extra wired mouse for the docking station however we don't keep stock on hand to provide multiple wireless mice per laptop.""

I felt like that was reasonable work-around. She gets an extra wired mouse, we have a million of them, and then she can keep the wireless on in her bag. Instead, she doesn't respond to the email and ignores it entirely.

I wish there was a happy ending to this story, but I found out from FriendUser later that she was just going to buy another wireless mouse and expense it to the bank. Which will probably get approved. There are just some special Users that make me drink heavily.",1,1627310448

2351,End user connects a desktop to a docking station,"A bit of backstory: we have almost exclusively laptops with docking stations in our environment, with a few desktops for specific use cases. Additionally, I work on an escalation team for hardware and OS-related issues.

This issue is a story of miscommunication, the gross misuse of terminology by the end user, and a bit of lying. Good grief, this one is a little infuriating, looking back on it.

Here’s how it goes: I get a cold transfer from our tier 1 support for an issue with the end user’s monitors not working on their docking station. The ticket is pretty typical for a tier 1 escalation—not much relevant information or anything else, for that matter. The end user is frustrated and clearly not very familiar with technology, and is one of the people that refers to a monitor as a desktop, modem, router, docking station, etc. When there is no clear definition of what is what, everything breaks down from there.

The end user says they have a desktop computer which they NEVER use and it isn’t connected to anything. They use their laptop and connect it to the docking station and that always worked—cool. After remotely accessing the device, I see it’s one of our desktop models, so I inquire a bit more about it. She is ADAMANT it’s the laptop, but msinfo32 doesn’t lie… in that event, I assumed she had plugged the display into her desktop computer and that was that. 

After some 1.5 hours of further investigation, here’s what I found:
- The end user had both a desktop and a laptop w/ docking station
- The monitor was never actually connected to the docking station and never had worked
- The end user was connecting a USB-A male to USB-C male from the desktop into the Thunderbolt 3 port on the laptop because she thought that was the docking station
- She had the docking station plugged into power and then into her laptop

Of course, this whole process of trying to determine what was wrong was exacerbated by them calling the desktop computer and docking station every possible piece of networking equipment you could ever think of. At the end of the call, we eventually were able to test the dock properly and turns out it was thrown into a closet because it was broken and they just drug it back out. After 2 hours of troubleshooting, I told her I had requested a replacement from the vendor, to which she asked why, as she never actually used the laptop.",1,1627272207
2352,Turn it on and leave it On,"This is another printer sharer saga from the dark ages. Way back when, the New Zealand Government, created the new Ministry of Women's Affairs (MWA) or something like that, However funding was fairly limited. I got a call to an Office where a lady was having problems printing, Actually several ladies were. A quick look around reveals 3 or 4 already outdated IBM PC XT machines connected via a serial print sharer to a HP Deskjet Printer, The printer is Offline with a Baud rate error. So I clear that and press Online. Ok I ask the user to print something. She says the PC is turned off and therefore she cant  print just now, she then turns it on. 

The print sharer is scanning around the input ports and this can be seen on the LEDS showing the Port it is checking. The thing works by outputting the DTR (ready) signal to each PC in turn. If a PC has a print job pending, it receives this DTR signal and outputs data, the sharer sees this and latches onto the port so the job can be completed, then eventually times out and scans again. Simple. In this case the PC being turned on would created some undefined output state while it powers up and this is seen by the printer sometimes when that port is selected. The printer sees a glitch on the RX line and since it doesn't  match the config for data bytes, 9600,8,N or whatever, it immediate goes offline with a Baud rate error. And stays Offline. 

The reason the PC's are turned Off, these ladies are doing ""Research"" by reading articles (Mills and Boon PROBABLY)  And the fans on these already redundant XT computers are too noisy. There's literally nothing I can do except advise them turn on the computer, press online on the printer and hope someone else doesn't turn on another one before they print.",1,1627271923
2353,Where's Earth?,"**Back in the dark ages** before Ethernet, I mean before coaxial cable 10 Mbps Ethernet was common, I was working as a Computer Cable installer, and trouble shooter. We did a lot of RS232 Serial printer connections and when several users needed the same printer, we would install a printer sharing box. (Printers were really expensive back then, so were the computers). The country is New Zealand.

I get called by one of our other installers to help him figure out a problem. I go on site which was an embassy from a European country.  He shows me the printer, the print sharer which already has some other PCs which are printing just fine. He has installed a new cable to an office for a new user and asks me to look at his wiring. I agree its fine, he's done it correctly, but in the process I felt a small electric shock. I tried to test it but it turned out my meter had a broken lead, It was good last time I used it so this was just bad luck it broke now. I could not not repeat the electric shock so began to wonder if I had imagined it. We go back to the PC and send some random text like a Dir list redirected to com1: Nothing. The PC has a second serial port, connect the cable there and Dir&gt;Com2: Bingo, it works, Ok set up the PC to redirect LPT1: to Com2: in Autoexec.bat and run it. Print again, Nothing. Try everything that worked before, Nothing.

Inform the staff that it must be some PC problem and we can't do anything more. Later I meet up with a Tech from the computer supplier and they change the Motherboard. It works, Print ok. Then NOT, Again! Try the second port, same thing, print once then nothing, Again. The computer tech and I start looking for clues as I tell him about the small shock I felt right at the beginning, suddenly I see it. The user came from Europe and brought the PC with him and his power cord and a travel adaptor with NO EARTH connector. Now I understand, the PC power Supply has capacitors from Phase to ground and Neutral to ground as part of the noise filter. And this acts as a capacitive divider which puts about 100volts AC in the PC case if not grounded. This is also signal ground from the the serial ports which our cable connected to the print sharer and therefore to signal ground of the printer and the other PCs connected there. The Comm ports (4 of them in the end, 2 ports each on 2 motherboards) on the New computer had all died after a short time due to the AC voltage. A new power cable was provided when the 2nd new motherboard was installed. Problem solved",1,1627270647
2354,I forgot to ask simple thing and got extended vacation and numb behind.,"One adventure of IT-guy before sweet sleep. 

There are one thing at my work that some times just suck. That is being a call even when I am on my vacation. Good thing is that when I am on vacation and I get that call to go to office and push some buttons, I get nice 3 hours of extended vacation for every hour I have to work. Plus travel expenses. Of course if Im out of country on my vacation, then I don't have to go. And the work time starts when I start traveling to the office.

Some years ago, I was on my summer vacation with my girldfriend of that time. We went to her dads summer cabin that is roughly 450km from our home. There were me, my GF, her father and step mother. My GF's sister and her boyfriend Andy

It was a morning, don't remember what day of the week it was but it was morning. I had just woken up and was ready to fill my self with coffee when my cellphone informed that it need my attention. 

I check the phone and see that the number is from work. Ok, there we go again. 

I answer and one of our project workers is in panic mode. 

Let's call her 'Jane"". Jane is some sort of a manager or rather a coordinator. She also has a collegue there that we can call ""Jill""

Jane explains that there is something wrong with their desktop printer. It does not print anything.  
This project does work with rehabilitation clients and is pretty much separated from our network. They got one small office with laptop and desktop printer. They don't have access to our AD and got their own instead. Some of the projects share their own AD and fileserver on different network than rest of us.  
They don't have same printing and copying solution as rest ot the organisation. So Janes project depends completely on that desktop printer. It's really a matter of funding. I got permit to buy them cheap laptop and cheap desktop printer and the money issued was an insult.   
It's goverment issued and they got their on jam.  
So that printer doesn't have LAN. It's usb only. And that should not be a problem as Jane and her collegue are only ones using the laptop and the printer.

Jane states that important client related documents has to be delivered to certain GOV institution next day and the printer is all bitchy.

So we start the remote repairs using our big brains and 

Me: "" So have you tried to turn the printer off and on again?""  
Jane: ""Yes, few times. does not help.""  
Me: "" And the laptop?""  
Jane: ""Yeah we tried to restart that too. Same thing. We try to print and nothing happens""  
Me:"" Mildy interesting...""  
Jane:"" The printer icon in control panel is grey like it's not on but the printer is on""  
Me: "" Ok now it is interesting""

Me: "" And check that the printer is connected to laptop also.""   
It's a usb printer and maybe they just forgot to plug it back if they used the lap top out of office. 

Jane:  ""Of course the printer is connected. I connected it my self! I have tried to disconnect it and reconnect it too.""   

Me: "" OK ok. "" Jane sounded like she is about to turn into dark side.  
Me:"" Maybe the cable is faulty. There are some spare cables at my office aaaaand forget. You dont have keys to my office. You don't have any spare usb printer cables there do you?""  
Jane:"" Haha no. You are the cable guy""  


Me: "" As I can't really help you from here is it possible that you loan some ones workstation and print it from there? Take the document on usb drive? Ill be back from cabin in a week.""

Jane: "" Not possible. There is no one here, every one is on vacation. ( It was July. In July whole organisation is pretty much closed for whole month. Only ones working are some project workers and they only go to office when they need to. July is remote work from home usually.)

Me: "" OK Ill start to make some calls. Maybe I can get some one there. Ill call you soon back""

I end the call with Jane and start calling co-workers. Well turns out that I can't get anyone to go to the office and help those poor project peeps out from their despair. I called and messaged everyone I could think off, even the director and nope. I think some of those people could go to the office but they simply do not want. And they don't have to if they don't want to.   
And I am not going to call every single employee anyway. 

So I call back to Jane.

Me:"" Well look like we are in sticky situation. Can't get anyone there.""  
Jane: "" Well how long it would take for you to drive here and fix this""   
Me: "" Umm it's 6 hours drive at least""  
Jane:"" Ok then. Start driving""  
Me:"" You sure? Your gonna need to stay there untill I arrive.""  
Jane: "" It's ok. As long you come""  
Me:""Ok. Ill get ready, you send me the formal request for onsite support via email so director and HR wont chew my ass of after my vacation""  
Jane:"" Will do, hurry up. We will wait here""

I start to put some better clothes on. 

When Im on vacation and get call to go to the office, who ever asks me to come has to send me a formal request so there is a proof that issue was not solved on a phone or remote session and I have to go to the site. And I did not have my laptop with me so I could not do much remotely anyway.

While I try to find some clothes to put on I get the email. I finish my coffee, call the director and explain the situation just in case and tell him that I have to go to the office on that project is in trouble. He says sure, go and do what needs to be done.   
Girlfriend I tell that I am sorry, gotta go, salt mine is calling.

So I drive next 6 hours back to home, get the office keys and my id card. Then drive to office. The long drive was boring and I could not feel my butt after 3 hours. It has ceased to exist. 

I arrive to the site to see my mechanical patient. I still can't feel my butt. It might died.

Me"" Hey Jane, I am here. lets dig into your problem"" 

Now poor Jane and her collegue have been there all day waiting for me.  
It's way past office hours but as it's summer and vacation season no one cares..

Jane:"" Finaly. I so hope you can fix this as we are royally fcuked if we don't deliver those papers tomorrow."" 

Me:"" No worries. If this is not fixed in 15minutes, Ill let you use my workstation and print the damn thing""

I think that fast and easy fix is to just reinstall the printer drivers.

I uninstall the printer drivers. Then I reach the usb printer cable... I know fore sure that this lap top has only 3 usb ports. One has mouse, one has usb thumb drive and one has external usb drive. Wait a second???! Brain starts to do M-A-T-H

I just jump from up from the seat and yell some profanity words.

I look at Jane and say

Me"" So you connected the printer usb cable all by your self riiiiight""

Jane:"" Yes. why?""

Me: "" Well you plugged the damn printer usb cable to the ETHERNET port, AGAIN! ""

And then I was pretty much pissed to myself as I forgot to ask her about it as this is not the first time some one does this, or her. It's a thing here. They frigging plug anything to anything as long it fits.  
I honestly thought they had already had gotten past of this idiocracy.  

Jane looks pretty horrified, mostly because she is having ""im an idiot"" moment. Jill not so amused. And Jill doesn't speak. Like ever. I have never heard her say a word. Creepy.

Me:"" Yeah. I should have asked you about this, this happens alot here. Happend to you too few months ago when you were having that presentation and your usb stick was ""broken"" remember!!!""

Jane gets a little bit color on her cheeks, the blush.

Jane:"" Yeah. I im little embarrassed now to be honest. I am so sorry you had to drive all that way here for this""

Me: "" Well I still have to drive back you know ""

Jane: "" Oh shoot. Yeah. Well thanks anyway. Ill be more observing next time about what I plug and where. Can you keep this between us?""

Me: "" Absolutely not. I have to write a report as I am on my vacation and you called me onsite. Report is needed so I can get the extended hours from this and travel expenses. So unfortunately director will see the report.""   


I install the drivers and the printer. I plug the cable where it belongs and printer prints just fine.   
I booked 7 hours of work and 460km of traveling. I got \~0.30 cents per Km. I got about 3 days extended vacation.   
Going back to the cabing was on my own expense and on my own time thou. 

Did not drive back that day. Went home and had some pizza and beer. I started feel my butt.  
I drove back to cabin next morning and my butt went all numb again.  
Jane got some serious verbal crackdown from director later but she took it all in and never discussed the matter much. She still reminds me some times how she has not plugged that many usb devices to her ethernet lately, just few.  
My girlfriend was pissed, her sister was pissed, her step mother was pissed, her father barely noticed my absence and Andy gave me a beer as soon I arrived to the cabin. I forgot the small and nasty interuption to my nice vacation after 8 beers.   
Butt recovered the feel too eventually.",1,1627270433
2355,How do I capitalize without Capslock?,"Short story from when I got my first help desk job. We only worked with internal employees and the lines were recorded so generally everyone was nice because they did not want to get in trouble with HR for berating IT.

User calls in

User: ""I can't get into (program name) my password does not work

Me: Standard corporate greetings and verification process

User passes and I unlock account and walk user through password reset process 

User: It still doesn't work

I am pretty confused as i'm still getting up to date on all the systems and I need to confirm he's talking about the right program. Users have two different sets of credentials for two different sets of programs, one of which is a mainframe system which uses both but for different parts of the mainframe.

About 40 minutes pass of me walking him through the mainframe and resetting both accounts. At this point i'm done and I am CONFIDENT i'm resting the right account for the program user does. At this point i've also issued the user a temporary password that will expire on use and the user still says it doesn't work. This is the third temp issue so I ask user to read out each key as he presses it on the keyboard. I've also from the beginning reminded user to NOT USE CAPSLOCK but had to give him a password that started with capitals.

User: Capslock P.......

Me: Stop, did you just say you hit Capslock.

User: Yes you told me it starts with a capital P

Me: *Trying not to send death threats* I want you to type a sentence in the address bar it can be anything.

I hear user type for a few seconds and then complain it's all in caps.

Me: Now hit capslock one and type the sentence over again, but instead on the first letter hold shift at the same time.

User then informed me it's no longer using all caps and seemed confused.

Once we got that cleared up it was like any other call except I felt defeated, the user felt dumb and my company paid me the same. I learned when giving temporary passwords since I had to audibly give it to them it's fine and even good practice to have them read each key they type if they seem to have issues with the temp password.

I know it's not the most interesting story but i'm sure we all have been there

TL:DR User wasted 40 minutes ignoring my requests to not use Capslock on a password without all caps because they did not know it locked all your key inputs to result in capital letters.",1,1627234256
2356,"I am writing a LETTER, do you understand!","Before I update my previous post that I made way too tired and too drunk. Im gonna share something that happend just resently, before my summer brake. 

You all know about different paper sizes at the office. You got your A4, A3, A5 etc. Also, some countries apparenly use size that is called 'Letter'.

Ok. We have a printing/copier system leased from major brand and it's pretty much perfect setup. Users can print to 'Secure printer' and then use their keycard to pull out the print from any of machine that has card reader. Only problem with whole system has a bug that no one has yet to managed to fix. Some times, systems default the paper size from A4 to Letter.

We only use A5, A4 and A3 at our Org. And Im not even sure if I could get size 'Letter' from anywhere as it is really not a thing in my country.

So thats is background info.

The incident

I get call some time at the afternoon from one of the teachers from our immigrant language program. She is super nice person. Always joyfull and even when she has a problem with tech and I can't ansver her call she does not flip. All chill and smiles. Also note that she is native english talker and is fluent in many languages my native language as well but we usually talk in english. 

She calls and tells me that she has big printing problem. I say ""ok, ill be there in a minute""

I head up and to teachers office. She tells me that she can't get the print out no matter how hard she tries. Printer just keeps telling that paper size is invalid. She also tells me that she is writing an important letter and she needs to print it, sign it and send it vie snailmail today.

I tell her to print it again and then we head to closest MFP and check what is the issue.

I turn my back and head to the MFP what is just around the corner. She proceeds printing.

She soon comes to MFP and I tell her to login to the machine. She swipes her card and Ill press the secure print and see that she has couple of pending prints there from same document. All are waiting for supplies. Ill put one of them to print and yes, get error that paper size is invalid. Machine want's 'Letter"". 

I look at her and we start talking.

Me: Yeah, print job is trying to print to letter, you need to choose A4 from your computer""

She: "" Im writing letter""

Me: ""Umm yes but you need to print it to A4""

She: "" No I am writing and printing a letter. A letter""

Me: "" Yeah but you need to print it to A4""

She looking be with confused eyes: "" A letter. I m trying to print my letter""

I could feel it. The anoying feeling when you get that thing behind your eye that makes your eye twitch uncontrollably. 

I look at her and say as calm as I can...

Me: "" I know that you need to print your ""letter"" but you need to print it to A4 because we do not have the size 'letter' here. You computer sometimes bug and defaults the papersize to 'letter"" so you need to make sure A4 is selected of you can't print. 

She looks me into eyes. I look her into eyes. We have moment here. Then she facepalms her self with both hands and mutters: 

""Oh god im so stupid""

2357,Case fans,"Getting ready to clean my tower today reminded me of a funny story;

So my Wife has been having issues with her self-built gaming tower overheating. She did a light clean, and that helped for a few weeks. She tried putting it up on casters to improve air access at the empty bottom fan port, no change.

She did some research on fan configuration, and figured out the fans were setup wrong (only one facing out, and trying to push out the bottom front no less). So, armed with this knowledge she decided she would add a bottom fan, Do a deep clean, and re-orient the fans.

This resulted in 7 fans, maxing out her motherboards 5 fan plugs, and 2 add-on fan plugs. Moment of truth, she turns it on. And.... One of the fans is barely running. Drat, it must have bad bearings and flipping it over was the last straw, right? So we file replacing it under future purchases, and she loads up a game.

As the game loads, the fan speeds up a bit, after a half hour it's spinning at full speed. Strange. So when she finishes her game off, and the fan starts slowing down again.

And it was at this moment my Software Engineer trained spouse realized she had plugged this case fan in as CPU-OPT, and the motherboard only spun it up when necessary... Oops.",1,1627224783
2358,When you ask for a color but can’t trust the answer,"

Last week someone called me from his homeoffice to tell me that he has no connection, so I asked him what was the color of the little circle on the top left screen 

(we use a hypervisor for our mobile clients that encrypts traffic (vpn) and the virtual disk of the vm and when in the vm, there is a colored circle at the top left that gives you information about the vpn connection) 

He told me it was green, what usually means that he is connected to the office. I searched a whole 10 minutes for the error before I told him I need to further investigate the problem with other colleges and asked him one last time to click on the colored circle and read the ip’s of the connections that it will show. He then said there are none….

I said: „but you told me the color is green“ 
He said: „ok, I have to tell you something… I’m colorblind“ 
I said: „that’s ok but it would have been better if you told me this, cause then I would have checked your connection in another way.“
He said: „but I was really sure ist is green“ 

I had a hard time trying not to laugh but could fix his problem after that.",1,1627205950

2361,"Cost for the day was $500,000+","I worked for a company that runs the public transport payment system. Weekly we would be supplied with updates to the stops and routes the operators used for the busses. Over time the number of stale stops and routes would build up. While I was in the position of doing that I developed a database script that identified the unused information and deactivated them. I ran this script every week, the bus drivers loved it because they only had the information they needed. There are many stop points that are critical to the system and my script excluded them from being deactivated.

I moved to the engineering section after the other employee returned from maternity leave. She was less technically inclined so the script was not run. Eventually the size of the information being sent out was exceeding the limit the devices could cope with. Despite me running every week for almost 12 months the cleanup under her went through the whole change request process, whatever. Another 2 years pass and she leaves, the replacement was much more competent and would submit a change request on a regular basis instead of waiting until it was past the limits.

So the six monthly deactivation rolls around once again I respond to the usual questions thinking what the hell is the problem running a script I ran every week. Monday morning after the deactivation I get a call at 6 letting me know that no passengers can tag on. I jump on the VPN and check, patrons can tag on the train but not the busses. As part of the script I recorded every action taken. I check the stops that have been deactivated, not one of them is in a route. I jump on a bus and tag to see the actual error is for my self, I ask the bus driver what he has been seeing, none of it makes sense.

We upload the weeks files again, if a stop is in the file the system reactivates it, does not help. I use a tool I developed that pretends to be a device and download from the system all the files that the device would, all looks good. We ran the same script in our test system, the busses work just fine. Since this P1 has been going on for hours the CEO and the minister are speaking on a regular basis.

Eventually we get the developers on the other side of the country that do the device software involved. I send them the files I had already downloaded, it immediately fails. They dig into the log files and find that a stop point that is hard coded in the device is deactivated. We activate the stop and all busses now work. However most drivers are unaware and still tell people the system is not working and to just get on.

The reason it did not go pear shaped years earlier is that hard coded stop point was used in a route. How or why that stop was the hard coded one or why the stop was no longer in an active route is unknown. All up the loss of revenue I heard was at least over half a million dollars, and probably closer to 600k. We didn't have to bear the entire cost of the outage, no idea what it cost the company.

If you are a developer DO NOT HARD CODE VALUES IN THE CODE!!!!!! At most put the value in the INI file so others can at least see what it is.",1,1627170158
2362,The router that could defy physics,"Disclaimer: I'm not in tech support. On mobile. Non-native English speaker. TL,DR at bottom.

Cast:

Me: Me.

Friend: My friend.

Level2: ISP supervisor

Level1: On-site support chap from ISP

Background: my friend was giving an old HP netbook (remember those?) to their father for checking email and the news. The machine was a dual core atom with 2 gigs of RAM, and naturally I suggested linux. Friend was supposed to drop by on a weekend when we'd hang out and make the machine somewhat usable for it's intended purpose.

So, into the story. Night before the weekend, I downloaded some lightweight linux distros : kubuntu, puppy, slax etc. I tried these one by one on my home workstation. All performed admirably. I selected one to roll and went to sleep.

My friend arrived on the next day with the machine. I installed the distribution of choice, explained the interface, then proceeded to connect it to my home wi-fi. It connected OK but couldn't access the internet.

I checked the router admin interface. It showed connected to the internet but no packet was going through/ being received. Checked my desktop. There was a globe icon in the taskbar - no internet. Checked my cellphone. It showed the wi-fi signal but whenever I used the internet, it'd use 4G data. 

I rebooted the router. Same issue. Called ISP helpline. Got escalated to Level2 because the issue couldn't be solved by helpdesk. We went through a lot of meaningless steps together (reboot the router again please, check the date on your devices, turn your wifi off, remove everything connected to the router and reboot again, ping works, I don't have a clue what's going on etc etc). Finally, Level2 gave up and dispatched Level1 to my location.

My friend had been watching me sweat and swear all the time. Finally they said, ""I once set wrong date and time on my PC. That PC couldn't access the internet too."" Now, I've just checked the dates on 4 devices. Nevertheless, their comment lit a bulb in my head. Just then, the Level1 bloke arrived at my door.

I let the Level1 struggle for about 10 minutes. Then I asked him to step aside, logged into the router admin panel and showed him something he'd never seen before. The router's date and time was set to about 49 years in the past!

We ended up resetting the darn router, and it was back to business as usual. Thanked the bewildered Level1 and saw him out. I installed a few linux goodies on the atom machine and handed it over to my friend. The battery has died, but the junk still works on AC power to this day.

Note: One of the distros I tried might be responsible for the whole debacle. I'm not sure that's the case.

Note 2: ""The time travelling router"" would have been a better title, except it's too spoilery. Time travel is probably theoretically possible, just couldn't find a better title for this post.

TL,DR: Router had ""mysteriously"" time travelled 50 years in the past, leaving me stranded on an important day.",1,1627155825
2363,Let's deploy an infinite loop to production on a Friday afternoon. What could possibly go wrong?,"Background: I'm on the helpdesk for our international company. Our company has an in-house ticketing system developed and managed by an internal team that happens to sit right next to us. It's great because we can ask for features and they'll actually be implemented in a reasonable time-frame. We get to skip all the paperwork and hoops to jump through that the rest of our company is so in love with.

The unofficial process is that we complain to them about something and a few days/weeks later we'll log on and suddenly find that they fixed it. Fantastic process... Usually.

&amp;#x200B;

A while back, someone from my team complained that users were replying to the emails that get sent when we close a ticket. The system would attach their email as a note to the closed ticket, and users were getting the expectation that their note on a closed ticket would be seen by someone... 

They were sorely mistaken, but that's not really relevant.

We were getting tired of calls about new issues written on random 3 month old and closed tickets, and how they're not being resolved, so someone brought it up to the ticketing system team and they grumbled agreement and we stopped worrying about it... 

Until we closed up shop on Friday afternoon, came in on Saturday morning for our normally pretty dead weekend shift, and took a few calls before we got the first person with an out of office message...

&amp;#x200B;

That's when we learned that late on friday afternoon, a small change was pushed to the ticket system.  If an email is sent for a closed ticket, the system automatically replies with a message saying the ticket is closed and asking for them to open a new ticket with nice instructions and pretty pictures... 

Out of Office messages were NOT accounted for. Not only that, they decided to be helpful and also send US an email when a user tried to reply to a closed ticket...

&amp;#x200B;

I'm sure at least a few of you are yelling at your monitors already, but for the rest of you:

Ticket system: ""Your ticket is closed!""

User's mailbox: ""I'm out of the office.""

Ticket system to us: ""A new note was added to a ticket you opened.""

Ticket system to user: ""This ticket is closed. Please open a new ticket.""

User's mailbox: ""I'm out of the office.""

Ticket system to us: ""A new note was added to a ticket you opened.""

Ticket system to user: ""This ticket is closed. Please open a new ticket.""

User's mailbox: ""I'm out of the office.""

Repeat until the team gets back in on Monday morning to revert the change. 

&amp;#x200B;

We told as many people as we could to momentarily turn off their out of office message to keep the spam bearable. Some people jumped off the call and disappeared for the weekend, leaving us (and themselves) with a weekend long deluge of emails... 

Tried to call them on Saturday to get someone to come in and just hit the big undo button. Found out on Monday that their manager (the only one we have a phone number for) went on vacation that weekend without her phone... 

&amp;#x200B;

There's two lessons to learn here:

One, NEVER EVER deploy to production at 5PM on a Friday.

and two, if you're going to automate replies to emails, be ready for the recipient to ALSO have automated replies to emails...",1,1627153400

2365,User can't find google chrome version,"Hi, I'm back. This one is from mum (she's IT support).

When she joined the company, their IT team was very archaic. Users were always spoonfed.

One day, the team sent out a company wide email asking users to check for which version of Chrome is installed on their PC. Easy task.

Minutes later, she gets an email from a user who can't find the version number. So they got on a call.

User gets on a browser (can't recall which), goes to the address bar and typed google.com. That was it. User literally thought they were the same thing.

Great thing is, my mum explains things to users. They generally like her and it sounds like some are keen enough to listen and learn. I'm sure they both had takeaways from that incident.",1,1627126146
2366,Coworker needs help filing a complaint.,"So I work as the it/tech support person for a medium sized company in the UK. This one happened about 20 minutes ago.

So I work a few hours normally each Saturday as our business works over the weekend. A ticket comes through from a coworker saying: “help reporting illegal website activity”. Hmm….. okay. That’s a new one for me.

So I head over to find out what’s going on and here’s the exchange:

Me: “hi how can I help”

Her: “I need you to fix this and report this company for me”

Me: “what is wrong?”

Her:” I need to get these files off this website and I need them now but the website says they’re closed for scheduled maintenance?!?! I need the files it’s illegal for them to do that!”

Me: *brain skips like a broken record player* “yeah ermm I can’t help with that, it’s not our website and it’s not illegal”

Her: *getting flustered and angry* “but I need the files now! Why can’t you fix this?”

Me: “I can only help with issues that happen in our company. I’m sorry but there’s nothing I can do”

Is this what my life is like now in IT?",1,1627117497
2367,It pays to listen!,"So while my direct title in the company I work for isn't exactly IT, it is well known my talents on the computer far exceed just about everyone in the unit. That bit of trivia makes me the prime target when it comes to employee training of ""If you need any help, just ask ""me""."" When you're dealing with people who look at a computer in awe, you know it's never going to be good.

This is where patience is really tested. We had a couple of new hires this week and neither one of them were very bright when it came to using a computer. Now mind you, I have my own work to do as well so I don't necessarily have time to constantly drop what I'm doing to assist these people when it should be upper management or HR that helps these people out. But what kills me to no end is how people don't listen to what you're telling them.

Just because you are not tech savvy, that's not an excuse to act completely clueless and incompetent. So here is a few exchanges that I've had with the new hires while they're doing their training. We'll just say I'm Jason, and then there's NH1 and NH2, New Hire to be exact.

NH1: Hey Jason, can you help me out with this? I don't know what to do.  
Me: \*rolls over to their cubicle\* Sure, what do you need?  
NH1: I can't figure out what happened, I'm working on this course but every time I click on it, it just starts this over.  
Me: \*looks it over\* So, what happens if you click on ""this button""?  
NH1: I did, and it just starts over again.  
Me: \*a bit perplexed\* Okay...so what happens if you click on this icon here? \*NH1 does so and it starts over again\*  
NH1: See? It's not working, I don't know what to do.  
Me: \*Thinking NH1 was lying about clicking on the button I asked about, I phrase it differently\* Have you tried clicking on ""this button (read it back to them this time)"". \*NH1 clicks on it and it proceeds\*   
NH1: Oh! Now it's finally working. I don't know how you figured that out. 

Um...the button I originally asked you about that you told me you clicked on...that's how. Now a few minutes later, NH2 chimes in.

NH2: Jason, I need some help, this isn't working right.  
Me: \*rolls over to their cubicle\* Okay, what's this issue?  
NH2: I can't figure out what to do with this screen. (It's a replica of our intranet homepage, and the course was on SDS).  
Me: Oh, I know how to get past this. Just click on the box at the top middle part of the screen where it says search.  
NH2: \*looks totally lost, then starts moving their mouse around and stopping it at random spots\* Here? \*Mouse is over the top right part of the screen\*  
Me: No, you need to go more to the left.  
NH2: \*Starts moving the mouse downwards instead and finds something else totally unrelated\* Here?  
Me: \*I'm getting irritated at this point because I've dealt with people who do this all the time\* No, that's not the top middle of the screen, that's the lower right. Move your mouse upwards to the top part of the screen and in the middle where there's (a very obvious) white search bar, click in that.  
NH2: \*moves the mouse up all the way and way over to the left on the address bar\* Here?  
Me: No! Right here! \*finally gets up and physically points to it on the screen\*.   
NH2: Oh, okay! Man, you're really good with computers.

Yeah, I am. But this is just a simple case of listening problems, has nothing to do with being good at computers. I finally get back to my work for about 5 minutes and then NH1 gets my attention again.

NH1: Jason, my screen went blank. What do I do?  
Me: \*rolls back from my cubical to theirs\* Oh, the software just timed out, you just need to refresh the page and it'll bring you back.  
NH1: \*proceeds to go up to the X and clicks on it\* Oh no, what happened to it??  
Me: \*really suppressing how annoyed I'm getting\* It's okay, just open your start menu and click on Google Chrome to get back into it.  
NH1: What's a start menu?  
Okay, fair enough...Windows hasn't openly said ""Start"" on the start menu since Vista. So I try a different approach.  
Me: Go to the lower left of the screen and click on the little white Windows logo and click on it.  
NH1: \*hovers over the recycle bin on the desktop\* This?  
Me: No...all the way to the bottom and then all the way to the left of the screen.  
NH1: \*manages to get it open\* Okay, now what?  
Me: The list is in alphabetical order, go down to the Gs and find Google Chrome.  
NH1: \*starts at it for what seems to be an eternity and then happens to notice the Microsoft Edge icon on the taskbar\* Wait, you mean this thing? \*hovers over it\*  
Me: \*feels himself die inside just a bit\* No...that's not what you're looking for, it's in the start menu under G, it says Google Chrome, it has a multicolored ball as an icon.  
NH1: What's an icon?  
Me: Uhhh....it's the little picture next to the words.  
NH1: Oh, you mean like this! \*happens to actually pick out Google Chrome this time\*  
Me: Yes, that's it! Click on it!  
NH1: \*Does those stupid overexaggerated clicks while moving the mouse half way across the desk at the same time\* It didn't work.  
Me: \*literally screaming inside at this point\* You moved your mouse while you were clicking...try not to move it and just press down on the left mouse button.

Finally after all this, I manage to get them back into their learning center and figure...now I can get back to work. Not 2 minutes later.

NH1: Jason, I can't find my training.  
Me: \*Looks at their screen\* Okay, just click on My Transcript on the right hand side of the screen and it'll list what you have to do and what is already in progress.  
NH1: \*stares mystified\* Up here? \*hovering over a useless picture\*  
Me: No, it's on the right hand side of the screen.  
NH1: Oh, okay. I see it now. \*proceeds to move the mouse over there and tries clicking on...nothing\* It's not doing anything.  
Me: You need to click on the text for it to work.  
Now I don't get this part, because some many people do it. They think they have to click at either the very beginning of the text or after it...but never actually ON the text.  
NH1: I clicked on it and it doesn't do anything.  
Me: You need to hover over the text and it'll turn into a finger and when it's a finger, that means you can click on it.  
Now the game of Parkinson's comes into play and for whatever reason they couldn't hover over somewhat large text to make it into a finger and instead just keeps randomly trying to click on it. At this point I just take the mouse out of their hand and I do it for them, kind of Nick Burns style.  
NH1: Oh, there we go!  
I just did the rest to get them back into their training. 

This went on for a couple of hours, finally I went on a much needed break and when I got back, they were leaving for the day. I never wanted to beat myself so much in the head. Again, failure to listen has absolutely nothing to do with not knowing how to use a computer.

And now a bonus from NH2, the next day (which was Friday).

NH2: \*comes waltzing into the room I'm in with my fiancee (who also works at the same unit) and has that look of ""I need you"" and a little smirk.\* Jason...the computer broke.  
Me: What do you mean? How is it broken?  
NH2: Well, the room went dark.  
Me: You mean the room lost power? (Granted, I'm sure it's on a different breaker but I still found it odd.)  
NH2: The lights went out and the computer shut off.  
Me: \*my fiancee (we'll call her Krystal) could tell I was agitated so she took him back into the room while I stayed where I was, wondering what the heck could've happen this time\*  
After some time, Krystal comes back into the room.  
Me: Well...what happened exactly?  
Krystal: Since he didn't move for a while, the automatic lights shut off in the room and then he ended up bumping the switch on the monitor, turning the monitor off.  


I just let out a deep sigh and prayed for mercy at this point. I'm not paid enough to deal with these sort of things.",1,1627103532
2368,This knob ? It’s part of the test procedure…. the tale of the $Million telescope crash,"Many decades ago I was an engineer working for a company that made weird equipment. Big telescopes that were used to track missiles and satellites as they wooshed up up and away. And I worked with the Best Technician In The World. We will call him Bob. Bob was so good he would get flown out on an F-15 to a classified site to work on a classified airborne optical system.

But Bob had a Bad Day. He was running a servo response test on an elevation drive (tilt up, tilt down). All good. He’s got a signal generator running and a spectrum analyzer hooked up and is running the drive on a nice sinusoid pattern. And the telescope is happily nodding. 

Bob reached for the frequency knob for the next test. But just then, lovely young Sally sauntered past. Bob was badly distracted by the standing wave evident in her blouse. And turned up the gain instead.

KaWHOOM !

The drive responded with full power. Whipped up, and back down at way past max speed. Broke off the emergency stop sensor. And crashed into the hard stop, breaking it off. 

And bending the telescope tube. Fucking it for all time. A lovely 1.5 meter Schmitt Cassegrain scope was toast.

Bob turned off the power. Bob picked up his coat. His hat. His lunch box. And went home. And got very very drunk.

His boss went to his house a day later and begged him to come back to work. He did , a week later. 

And the telescope ? We had a spare tube . The glass was okay. Took a week to pull it apart and put back together and calibrate, but all was well.

After that, Bob started putting up cardboard and plywood walls while doing tests to avoid distractions.

And Sally ? She features in another story about the use of a FLIR camera, leading edge auto tracking, and how you can use IR imaging to determine which couples are having nooners.",1,1627095788

2371,You're in BIG trouble. The boss is looking for you.,"No good deed goes unpunished.

I grab a ticket: ""\[BigWig #2\] in \[largest software company in the World\], wants a new computer.""

Cool. I get to deliver and setup  a brand-new system for someone important! I'm bringing the GOOD stuff!

I love imagining the way people feel when they use a new system for the first time, especially after they've struggled with an older one for a while.

Getting the configuration work done at the end of the day, I decide to make his morning, by installing it before I go home.

Grabbing all the new stuff, keyboard, mouse, PC, etc., I go to his liberally windowed, corner office to  finish the job.

OH MY GOD. HIS OFFICE.

Star Wars, Star Trek, toys, figures, everywhere, anything ever printed with ""Star"" on it, is sitting on shelves, multiple levels, completely around the office.

Colorful stuff, all wrapped in plastic, new, immaculate, modern.

I look at his ""old"" system. It's oooold. His keyboard is the most basic, grungy white, $15 membrane type, and has letters that have been completely worn through, the PC has streaks of ""stuff"" running down the sides, it's a dirty, scummy, noisy, thing. The mouse was the basic, white, 2-button, OS2-looking museum piece.

I'm thinking, as I look over the cart filled with brand-spanking-newness ""Oh man, is he EVER going to love this NEW stuff. I mean, just the cool-looking MS multimedia keyboard is a bright blue with knobs and dials...""

I get it all setup and tested, and, as I'm leaving, toss the old stuff in the trash outside of his door.

Walking back to my office, that voice in the back of my head starts talking.....

""Hey, smart guy, have a quick question for ya; now why would a guy with such an interest in Star Wars and Star Trek be using such old equipment? I mean he's \[BigWig #2\] in \[largest software company in the World\] whos policy is to replace EVERY PC that's 3 years old, right? He can have ANYTHING.""

""But,"" I reply back to myself; ""the shiznit I just dropped-off is sooo COOL... and MODERN... and CLEAN! And, he's a top leader of one of the most advanced corporations on the planet, so surely he'd want the modern, and productive, stuff!"" 

""Yeah, yeah, of course you're right, WHO wouldn't want all of that?!?!? Why would I even ask such a thing. Sorry to bother you.""

I'm about 3/4 of the way back to my office, and stop.

""Fuck.""

Turning around, I go back and grab the scummy keyboard and sad example of a mouse from the trash. The PC stays though, I have my standards.

The grungy keyboard and ""I won't click anymore"" mouse go back to my office, and into a cabinet... just in case.

Next day, I come to work a bit late, and am greeted with ""Hey, I think you're in big trouble, the boss has been looking for you."" Pro tip in support, when the boss ""has been"" looking for you, it's NEVER for a pleasant reason.

The boss tells me ""Mr \[BigWig #2\] is looking for that stuff you replaced last night. You didn't... THROW IT AWAY did you?...!!!"" As if he isn't fully aware of our policy to get rid of junk and trash immediately. And that the trash is taken-out every night.

""Yep, sure did, like we always do! Didn't he love all of the new, shiny, modern, WORKING hardware? I mean, his new mouse now has 4 BUTTONS, OMG! The freakin' keyboard has MULTIMEDIA CONTROLS!""

""No."" Boss says. ""THAT keyboard and mouse were the very first ones he's used since college. He wants them back, now, WHATEVER IT TAKES."" Mr \[BigWig #2\] is like 50+ years old now, WTF?!?! Since college?!?!

""HA!"" Inner voice yells at me. ""TOLD YOU SO!""

\[I sigh\]

Opening the cabinet, I pull out the items. ""These old things?""

\[boss\] ""You DIDN""T throw everything away then?""

\[me\] ""Well, the PC went to the recycler, but I hung on to these. Something told me that it wouldn't be appreciated, and I was right."" ""That PC though, was a risk for the entire organization and it needed to be removed from the network, so it's gone for real.""

\[boss\] ""Well, go do the needful and make him happy.""

I take the IT junk to \[BigWig #2\] office and, as usual, he's not there.

Replacing the new, shiny, modern equipment with the old scummy, grungy stuff, I couldn't help myself and cleaned just a tiny spot on the keyboard.

I like to think that he occasionally looks at that spot and thinks; ""Damn, there's a part of my college education I'll never get back...\[sad emoji\]""

I learned later that, almost all of the items in his office were given to him by others, who think he has a fetish for Star Wars and the like.

Sometime it's all for show, for others to see. To establish your worthiness of position or class. But it all can be fake, fake, fake.

We crunch enormous amounts of data on extremely powerful hardware (a researcher once told me 500TB would be considered a 'small' dataset). Roughly half our computing estate of \~2,000 machines is dedicated to processing batch jobs. It gets expanded every year, sometimes more than once, according to the budget. There's around 100 machines in each generation. Usually, there's a fairly formal commissioning process, involving benchmarking and stress-testing to find any potential lemons, as well as collect power use stats for the data centre operators. However, a combination of factors (and covid) has led to a noticeable part of the current batch farm being unavailable for jobs at present, and many delays in us getting last year's hardware ready to rack. As a result, our team has been under pressure to get the latest generation into use as quickly as possible. For those who like hardware, if I said each machine has 64 cores, 128 threads, 512GB of RAM, 4TB of SSD and 25Gb ethernet, and there's 110 of them, imagine how eager the guys who run the software side of the farm are to get their hands on them. These machines run flat out 24/7/365 for about 5 years of service.

So, we accommodate as best we can. We get the hardware racked (5 racks worth), new switches and PDUs installed and configured to monitor network and power, spec the machines in our management infrastructure and set them up for automatic install. We put an OS on to check the machines work, then we update all the firmware to latest before running our benchmarks.

Unfortunately we hit a snag here - unbeknownst to us, this brand-new generation of machines has a quirk whereby updating the BIOS resets it to factory defaults. The supplier we bought the machines from has specifically tweaked the BIOS for us for maximum performance. The defaults result in a 30% drop in performance. And it's not a simple process to put it all back by hand. So that set us back by over a day - a colleague and I had to change the boot settings on all 110 machines by hand just to get them to start up. But it'll be worth it, right?

So after finally being told about a tool that can re-apply the BIOS settings in bulk, we move to the next step in the process - benchmarking. We decide on a truncated series of tests that'll give us the numbers we need, but nothing more. These take about 24 hours to run. A colleague even remotes in on his day off to collect the outputs so we can hand over the machines today. Usually we do a fresh install of the machines before handover to remove our benchmark stuff, but my boss, under pressure, agrees to hand them over as is, and let the software team handle the rest through config management.

Being government, one of the perks of this place is leaving an hour early on Fridays. So there I am an hour later, still on my work laptop, browsing Reddit, when who should pop up on Slack but the head of the software team, the guy we handed these machines over to only hours earlier.

$ST:  &lt;17:07&gt; ""Hey $me, the new machines haven't picked up their config-management profiles. I try to SSH into them and I get a password prompt \[rather than normal key auth\]. I know it's late on Friday but can you quickly poke a machine or two and tell me what the state of them is?

$me: &lt;17:08&gt; ""That's unusual, what did you apply?""

$ST: ""I set all the machines to reinstall the OS. I want to run a newer kernel and doing this on a running OS would cause package conflicts.""

At 5PM on Friday?

I open up the IPMI to one of the machines and check. It's running its usual post-installation script - on a good day, our automated installation setup will finish in 30-40 minutes. On these blazing-fast SSD-based machines, 20 is more normal, so these have definitely been started after most people left for the day. I move onto the next machine in the batch.

A random bug in the post-installation system is that sometimes the network doesn't come up on first boot. It's unpredictable, but without network, the script just hard-errors-out and leaves you with a blank machine - no accounts, no software, nada. The only way in is via the local console as root. Experience tells me new hardware is particularly susceptible to the bug.

Sure enough, the next machine is running the base kernel. Signing into the console, I find the logs indicate the bug struck. Okay, not complicated, bring the network up manually and restart the script (which will configure the network permanently).

Right, one down... Oh right, 108 more to go. I'm the only one from the team still online and the only one $ST can see who knows the root passwords. I plod through about 20 machines and get them all kicked in the right direction before deciding I can't spend my entire weekend doing this. $ST is grateful for the ones that are now running. The rest will have to wait in their limbo state until Monday.

When me and whoever else I can convince to help, will have to go through the remaining $n machines, manually open the console, log in and run the magic commands to complete the post-install stuff. Suffice to say, $ST will be buying donuts next week.

Moral of the story - when weekend clocking-off time rolls around, close your company IM immediately...",1,1627073290
2373,"Migrate to get away from old tool, duplicate characteristics of old tool","The company I work for has participated in a number of enterprise wide migrations.

I've helped to support at least three in some fashion.

Oddly enough, all of them seem to follow roughly the same pattern.

1. We become dissatisfied with the limitations of the old tool.
2. We cast around until we find something that we like better.
3. We purchase the new tool.
4. We then duplicate the exact same configuration in the new tool that we had in the old tool.

* We need continuity in terms of data
* People had become familiar and were comfortable with the old interface

Repeat the above process every few years.

I'm in a migration right now where a small but vocal group of users in pilot is driving all sorts of decisions the rest of the org does not care about. But they want what they had with the old tool. Unfortunately, we also did all the development first without engaging in any end user testing at all. And the result was rejected as wildly impractical by almost all of our testers.

So now we are in a massive fire drill for the next three months to revamp all of it before our current contract with the old tool expires, while also trying to explain to the pilot testers that you can't always get what you want.",1,1627073197
2374,"Oh, that? That's been broken ever since we got it.","First, some background. I work in a research and development laboratory as a team of two where we use a number of different specialized pieces of equipment including data acquisition systems, high speed cameras, electric pulse and function generators, and temperature chambers. Our IT people don't support this equipment so if something goes down, we're on our own. I've quickly learned the value of RTFM. 

We have a sister site that does mostly production work. Their test department does real simple stuff with a smaller range of equipment following well established procedures (although some steps are unwritten.) As such, the tech in that department has generally not needed to be technically savvy and so the man who was in that position (we'll call him Jim for no particular reason) put little to no effort to actually understand the equipment he was using.

Jim's two solutions to problems were either to give up and ignore it or call us if it was something he couldn't ignore. This meant our sister site accumulated a lot of 'broken' equipment. To be fair to Jim, a decent amount was actually broken, as we have come to expect given we're testing explosives, but there were times when things just needed a little bit of TLC or buttons pressed in the right order.

Jim recently retired and his replacement, Mark, got the bare minimum in terms of training from Jim and now Mark has basically been thrown into the deep end. Fortunately, Mark seems up to the task and at the very least was shown the things that only exist as tribal knowledge rather than being written down and documented. 

A few weeks ago, I was at our sister site to do some testing we couldn't do at my home site. Mark is helping out as a training opportunity and his own testing is dead in the water because the guy he's been working with who has the special license we need to do the testing is in vacation and Mark doesn't have one yet. 

Well good news. I have this special license and it looks like my testing is going to finish early. Let's prep the test samples and get Mark moving on his stuff because it's holding up production. It's also a good opportunity for me to see what they actually do for testing here since I've never seen it and their written procedure sucks.

Prep involves conditioning some samples at an elevated temperature. Easy enough as both sites have a couple of temperature chambers for this. We go where they keep these chambers. The big one's already in use on something. Then the following (paraphrased) conversation happens.

Mark: Oh, I guess we can't test.

Me: What? Why?

Mark: Someone else is using the oven.

Me: *points to other chamber sitting dormant* What about this one? *starts punching in our target temp of 250F*

Mark: Oh, that? That's been broken ever since we got it.

Me: Broken how? *suspicious that a $10,000+ piece of equipment has never worked*

Mark: It won't stay at temp. 

Me: *taking a closer look* Looks like it's throwing an alarm.

Mark: Yeah, Jim couldn't figure out how to stop it so he just silenced it.

Me: *tapping buttons on the limit control panel* Do you guys have the manual?

Mark: I don't think so.

Me: Alright, let's find one.

And we're off to Google. A few minutes and a manual is printing. I send Mark to grab it while I go back to the oven to see if I can figure out what the issue is. This chamber being new, it's control panel and limit control panel are different from what we've got at my home site. Fumbling through the menu I figure out the alarm is for a limit being exceeded and therefore power to the heating element is cut off.

 I fumble my way to see the limits are set to 300 and -10. Ok, even if that was in Celsius, we should be well within that. WTF. Mark comes in with the manual. As I'm rifling through, I realize this manual is for a temperature controller with the same model number and not a limiter. Back to Google. 'Model number limit' goes into the search bar. Bingo. I do a quick skim to make sure I have the right thing before I print off another 100 page document. Then I come to a realization. I sit up and look at the wall in the direction the chamber is in.

Me: I think I figured it out. 

Mark and I head over and I start tapping away at panel. Yep. Someone *cough*Jim*cough* mixed up the low and high end limits so the chamber would throw alarms and not work if the temperature was between -10F and 300F which it always would be. Thirty seconds later, we had a second fully functional temperature chamber and testing could continue. I then proceeded to watch in horror as I find out this test the company has been doing for decades is unreliable, a bit unsafe, incredibly unscientific, and takes longer than it has any right to, but that's a tale for a different subreddit (probably).",1,1627058625

2381,Another “I never used Excel before…” story,"I’m not in tech support so hope I’m still ok to post here, but the headline of a recent “I never used Excel before…” post reminded me of my own wtf moment with Excel from back in 2008 and wanted to share. [Rules say no links so will share in the comments]. 

I had graduated and started a job as an internal Analyst with one of the big, global manufacturers, one that had a generally IT-literate employee base. Our team used a couple of niche simulation programmes to do prediction analysis but our outputs would always be presented to our “clients” in Office apps - Word, Powerpoint and/or Excel, which everyone had access to and knew how to use. Nearly everyone. 

On this occasion we had been asked for a favour by another department and the guy (apparently some bigwig) was looking for some prediction data for three different scenarios and needed it urgently. We had already been working on something similar for someone else so I sent over a cut of the bits he wanted pretty quickly - same day instead of a few weeks/months. You’re welcome. 

But instead of a thank you, my boss got an angry email that we had only sent over information for one of the three scenarios. I assured him that - no - I had sent all three, each one was on a separate tab and if he checked again he should see he had everything he asked for. 

But after a couple more emails backwards and forwards, and double-checking my outbox, and even re-sending just in case the extra tabs somehow went missing in transit(?!), he was adamant the information wasn’t there and was acting very huffy, entitled and condescending. He even implied we were being willfully obstructive along with one of his re-requests for the information that I had already sent him. 

It didn’t take long to escalate to the point that he demanded a phonecall to get the key figures from us (despite him being far too busy for such things) before we ruined his important meeting with our incompetence. 

We didn’t have screensharing back then but it still didn’t take long to ask him to “look down, down, do you see the words option 1, option 2, option 3 just above the bar at the bottom… over on the left?” He did. His voice sounded quieter now. “Click option 2”. Oh. 

Turns out he didn’t know what tabs were and didn’t think to ask. In 2008, he still thought Excel was only ever one page. And I never did get that thank you.",1,1627028225

2383,The 'T' in IT is not for trainer.,"Not a techie like you guys, but ages ago I was the most computer literate person in the tiny car dealership I worked at so I had to try and fix IT and tech problems before the bossman would agree to call a professional.

As such I was responsible for working with the newspaper to design and proofread our adverts, and keeping an electronic arvice of documents. We hired an office staff though an ad which stated that proficiency is MS Office is a must. She was interviewed and Job tested by the HR manager. Soon after starting it was very obvious that she knew very little about MS Office and in fact computers in general. She would need help with creating documents, printing, pretty much everything, which took up most of my time and i was falling behind in my other tasks. Office gossip was she was that she was the mistress of the HR manager. I eventually got tired and told her she would have to figure out how to do her job as it wasn't my responsibility to do so.

Next day I was summoned to the director's office about a complaint against me. Complaint was that I was refusing to address the IT issues she was having. I step in, and of course HR manager isalso there. After I've heard thsir side I am asked to give my side of story. I begin by asking her to verify the tasksfor which I have given 'IT support'. To my surprise she freely admitted that she was getting help for me in basic Windows and office functionality. I then brought up the ad for the position she had applied for and asked if she had been tested as being competent in MS Office by HR manager during her job test why was she expecting me help in things she was supposedly skilled in?

I was then asked to leave the room and to twll the director's secretary to bring in the lady's personnel file. Ultimately nothing happened to anyone apart from the company paying for her to be trained in Windows and Office. She left shortly afterwards for another job.",1,1627011055
2384,You are too late. all is done. Get your junk.,"Storytime. Heck. I don't know what is wrong with me. I posted one and can't stop. Well here is one for this sub.  This is long and kinda boring. If it's TLDR yoi can skip to the end where it all in nutshell.

Backstory. I work as Executive systems administrator in large non profit organization. I am pretty much only ""IT-guy"" in whole organization and always pondered why the heck they made me executive.  
Not important now but later.   
Anyhoo, we got all kinda business stiring and we buy this crazy huge recucling center from our city who just want to get rid of it. Maybe they just don't want to administrate it anymore. Our director and board instantly drop an offer to buy the recycling business and offer goes trough and deal is struck. 

Yey. More work for meeee. Yatta!

So deal is done at november 2019 and business will move into our lap at january 2020.   


I get call from my director that there is a meeting hapening just before chistmass about tech needed there. Okay. 

Meeting is with our director, office manager, Wages/HR, accoutant, me and new manager from that recycling center.  We talk about what they got now and what they are going to need. Some workstations, cashier systems, cell phones, tablets. Basic stuff. Then new manager ask about internet. 

Well they got line from local operator and that line goes away soon. Business will transfer to us in january and we need to have our there by end of february. So 2 whole months to do the tech switch.

Im confident that this is pretty easy. I get amount of stuff we need and drop order to our tech supplier and ask that all that stuff is delivered straight to the recycling center so I don't have to haul all that stuff from other side of city where our main office is. I only wanted the server hardware to my office so I could prep them there before xmas. 

And no no no. They did not recycle new computers and printers I got for them. That would have been hilarious. 

I have never visited that place and I have no idea about it.   
I tell this new manager, that I want to drop by first thing in january to check the place and need to see the main network drawings. He says that there is no drawings. Who recycling center is in somekinda old factory or something. And also there are multiple other business there from small engine repair shop so lunch restaurant to metal ship and god know what. Place is huge. There are several hundred rooms there. Place has been under renovations for decades and when ever some rents some space from there and wants new walls to be done or old down or what ever, the owner of the building happily complies. So now I have a little consern. 

January comes and right after my xmas vacation I head straight to the recycling center that is now officaly ours. And behold. It is huge, just like manager told me. The customer side is just humongous and the storage area is even bigger. I head to a door that says ""staff only"" as I assume it's the office. It is and I look for the manager. He thanks me for the new computers that arrived before xmas and are stored at the office storage and has many notes that these are not for sale or recycling. ( yeah. they had indicents where too eager employees have sold other employees personal items like bikes and stuff. haha nice place )

I took my notebook, a paper one and pen and ask a tour. I want to see the premises, every office, work space and scout the lan sockets first that I can write all down. Then I want so see all network cross sections there is.   
Well shiiieeeeeeet. There is over dozen cross sections all over the building. And best part is that the labels make no sense. It's like there has been multible networks in past and that new ones have just been dumped over the old ones. I mean cablebundles that are thick as a grown man. A literal mess. 

But im lucky. As there is still all the tech that is property or out City. I only need to look every cross section cabinet that has City property routers and then look the cable labels and refer them to office network sockets. Easy peasy. Take time but I should be done in day or two. 

And i was right. There were switches in four cabinets only and all the socket labels matched so I took photos and write is all down. 

And then I started to install out stuff. First network. I just put out switches into cabintets along with city property as there was more than enough space there. Then I routed our switches to free network sockets at offices . Next I called my contact at local ISP and asked my options about the internet line. He told me that there is already a fiber there so we can either get line from ISP or we can contact the landlord who owns the building and use their solution. Apparently owner rents fiber connection too to resident business there and it's 100% legal and fine. Well not rent but it's ""included"" to the rent of premises. 

So I take the owners solution as it might take too long for ISP to get line open. I know that they can be a bit slow sometimes and I only got time untill end of next month I want this to be done. 

So I call the owner of the building and we get agreement and I install our routter to their main cross section cabinet that happens to be in recycle centers premises in an hour after caling him. Just superb service. 

I go to one of the offices, pull my laptop. hook it to free network socket and yes. we got internet and connect to router and start configuring it. After im done. I tell the manager that Ill be back to tomorrow and install the new workstations. They all got big desks so new workstations can be there pararel to old ones that are gonna be taken away soon. 

So it took 2 days to scout the place, setup a network and new workstations for all. As servers were already prepped, it took less than hour to get AD up with file and print server and I was about done. I also setup a wifi that covers the whole are of recycling center. 

All was left was the cashier systems. That was little harder as everybody was almost arguing what they want and what they need. I desided let them sort it out and contact me when they are done. As soon it's settled before end of january so we have time to get everything. 

Also I got a interesting call from ""major computer brand"" that was supplying our city their tech and this dude with nasal sound started the convo on phone like this.

Nasalman: "" Is this OP. I was told that you to be contacted regarding tech swap at recycling center. I am soon starting to gather a team of experts to make the swap.""

I just thought that for a moment in my mind. Team of experts, to haul 4 switches, one routter and 4 workstations away? wtf. 

Me: "" Ok. what timeframe you have in mind?""

Nasalman: "" Well the tech is needed to removed there by the end of february but I am not sure we can get the team together that soon so it might go to the end of march."" 

Me: ""Ok. take your time. Anything else?

Nsasalman: "" No. I just wanted to inform this to you.""

Me: ""Thank you! be in touch!

Now this was in the first week of january right after new year. I already setup out network. installed new workstations, got the servers and emplyees are already using their new computers for work. Next week I disconnect all the property of computer brand  stuff and pile them into office storage to free some space for workers. They dont need to have to workstations on their desk anyway. 

So january goes by. It's now February. Hell is frozen, it's so cold here. We are talking about -30degree celsius. My car is like lol nope every morning and I am so tired all the time as I haven't seen the sun for few months now. 

I go to the office and call up a meeting regarding the cashier systems at recycle center.   
well of cource they have only been arguing about it and did not come to conclusion so I take the controll and say. Yeah. You get iZettle for now. We have to put up something and we use iZettle here at our cafeteria and restauraunt and it's should bend to your needs. Well few objections from recycle centers cashiers but I keep stand behind this. I order couple of full sets of iZettle stuff, iPads, stands for ipads, card readers, receipt printers etc.   
I make the needed accounts and we go trough the items they need in there. 

Took a week. Done. Now I disconnect the old cashier machines, cardreaders etc and put them to another pile to the office storage. 

All goes fine and then it's business as usual. 

February goes by and we are late in march when I get the call.

Nasalman: "" Hi. My team is ready for the swap. Is next week ok for you. We should arive on site about 9.00 in the monday morning."" 

Me: "" Sure thing. See you on monday"". 

Nasalman"" Ok then bye.""

I head to recycling center on monday. 

Park my car and go inside. I check the old junk is still at office storage and no one has sold them of too them to recycling where stuff will be teared to pieces and then sorted by materials. Nope. All here.   


Clock is almost 10 when the experts arrive. Holy crap. I know that a team of experts if pretty overkill to get few old computers and network switches but a dozen guys. Half of them in suits. 

I meet them up at the lobby. They look around and ask me ""Where can we found OP.""  
I can hear the nasal sound from his voice. This is the same guy I talked on the phone.

I say. Im OP. Ok they look me while but then shrug their shoulders.   
I would like to point that I was nerdy looking fellow back in my days with short clean haircut, hoodies and blue jeans of beige chinos and skate shoes. Now I got golden long hair that reachers my shoulders. I beard. I wear mostly skinny black jeans and in winter also old black combar boots that have seen better days. I have my leather biker jacket and under it thick wooled shirt, black one that has text ""DOOM"" written in white on it. So I don't look your average executive systems administrator. 

So they say "" We thought there would be a professional here to meet us"". I tell them. Yeah. Im pro, believe me. This way getns. I walk them to the office storage and point the two piles of junk.  
Not literal piles. All were neatly put in place as we didnt want to brake them. 

""There is your stuff. Your are welcome. Do you need cart or something?""

The suits and their entourage, the tech experts possibly went silent for a moment. 

""What is this? We were supposed to make a tech swap and were are here to map and plan to process. Why is our stuff here?"" The guy in suit asks. 

""Well we had to get our systems operational before end of february, you know, then city finaly shuts down internet here and also shuts down the AD and everything here so I put our stuff operational at the start of january as why wait. So we are now at the end of march. Is february before of after march?"" I give you a hint. Look to the floor where your stuff is. 

""This is completely unprofessional. You had no authority to disconnect and remove our stuff. I will report this to your superior. Why is your manager?"" Suit rants. ( I had every given right btw)

Im like lol. Did he just say that? "" Yeah. My manager would be executive director manlyname""

""No, I mean your manager, not the head honcho."" 

"" Yeah. that would be the headhonco. director manlyname""

He looks at me in disbelief. Oh these corpo guys. No wonder Johnny Silverhand hates them.

""And you are?"" He mumbles. 

""Im anothermanlyname, executive systems administrator here"" 

""You know what is truly unprofessional?"" I ask. 

Dude is still pissed, I can see that from his face. Rest of this bunch are just silet and stare the stuff on the floor. 

"" It's very unprofessional to spend almost three months to gather a team of experts to haul couple of computers. Also take note that all of this stuff was supposed to be out of here month ago. Tech swap was supposed to be done month ago. Im sorry that is not unprofessional, it's just incompetent.  
There are carts you can borrow at lobby. have a nice day""

And I left back to my office. Funny thing. I never heard of them again. No complaints, nothing. Weird  right?!

  
In nutshell if that was TLDR. After buying a business from city, city and their tech supplier had 2 whole months to collaborate tech swap with us. As there was actually no need to any actual ""swap"" just install our stuff and remove theirs, I did all that in first week after business trasfered to us. They how ever took 3 months to show up and were really really upset when all had already done. They had gathered a massive team of experts for the swap and now all they had to do was to haul that old junk back where it cam from.

I think Im gonna propose we take workstations from them on our next lease cycle.   
I can't wait to work with these guys again! :D",1,1627010369
2385,Context menu does not open,"Today's top post reminded me of an incident that happened a while ago and that I had forgotten about until now:


My MIL is a very non tech savvy person. She is one of those people that are absolutely not interested in learning how to do the most basic stuff and always keep asking other people to do it for them. Whenever she can't do something she will call her daughter to fix it for her. She won't even do the most basic internet search for a problem. Just goes straight to calling her kid.


I'm unsure what the problem was this time, but the solution involved a right click to open the context menu and selecting one of the options. At first, she was instructed via phone.


It would not work.


Then the screen was shared and it became clear that something was going fundamentally wrong: Whenever my MIL was performing a right click the context menu would fail to open.


I still don't know how, but at some point my genius of a wife figured it out.


For a right click her mom would use the index finger of her right hand on the touch pad of her laptop whereas for a left click she would use the index finger of her left hand.


Her RIGHT INDEX FINGER. For a RIGHT click.

2387,Apparently out of order signs mean nothing,"I worked tech support during college. The group I was on worked mainly with classroom projector systems and stuff like that. Most of our calls were about professors not knowing how to plug in HDMI, change inputs, etc but we also had a couple of the old-school overhead projectors with the clear plastic you write on with markers. These were kept on carts that professors could grab from a designated area in each building since we didn't need one in each classroom. 

One day I got a call to check out one of the overhead projectors because the light was flickering. I get to the classroom and see they failed to mention that the power cable was completely bare at one section and was visibly arcing to the metal leg on the cart.

Obviously using that is a big no-no/fire hazard, so I grab another projector cart for the class to use and ask what I should do about the arcing projector. I was told to put it back in the storage area and label it out of order. The vendor would come later that week to replace the power cable.

So I zip tied a plastic bag over the plug, zip tied the power cable to the cart so it couldn't be plugged into the wall, and taped 3 big yellow and black out of order signs on the projector itself. I thought that would be enough to make sure everyone understood ""don't use this.""

Two days later I get another call, there's another class complaining about a flickering overhead projector. I get to the classroom and it's another bare power cable and the same professor. He's not happy that this has happened twice in a row. Starts going off about how IT can't keep anything in working condition etc.

At first I'm surprised that the same thing happened twice, but then I see some nice yellow laminated paper in the trash can. I look closer and it's the out of order signs.

Now it's important to know that there were a total of 3 other overhead projectors in the storage area but apparently the professor wanted to use the out of order one because ""that's the one with the smudge on the side I always use.""

He shut up pretty quick about the state of IT equipment after I pulled the signs out of the trash and taped them back on the overhead projector in front of the whole class.",1,1626998998

2390,brand new Lenovo laptop makes strange noise,"Lenovo ideapadgaming 3 15ARH05. Sound issue from within


Hey , 

I bought brand new Lenovo ideapadgaming 3 note , the computer itself is working fine , however , there is a sound that occurs every 6-8 seconds from within the note , and its not related to the audio system , i can even feel the quick vibration when the sound occurs under the keyboard. The random sound is coming from the inside , i turned off the audio system it still occurs.
I only have the note for 4 days so the problem is not related to dust etc. 
ill attach the recorded sound sample
It is really irritating as the sound is re-occurring and I physically can feel the vibration of it.
Thank you for attention , have a good day people.

2395,Are you hard of hearing?,"I just remembered a fun episode I had many years ago.

Back in the day of CRTs, I got a call about a workstation making a high pitched noise that was driving the user crazy.

On the phone, I instructed her to leave the desktop computer on, but turn off the monitor.  She could still hear it, so I suspected cooling fan or HDD and took a walk to investigate.

When I arrived, I walked up to the backside of her computer and listened, I heard nothing.  She rolled her chair back and I listened to the PC and CRT from the front: still nothing and she said she did not hear it anymore.

I logged the call and we shrugged it off (she was the kind of user that was a pleasure to work with). 

30 minutes later, rinse and repeat.  We did this four times before she left for lunch.  She was getting very frustrated, but still polite. I asked her the log out and shut down for lunch and I made my way to her office again.  

When I got there, I stopped and listened.  Nothing.  I sat down in her chair and pulled up to her desk to start powering devices up.  Before anything got turned on, I heard it: barely audible, but annoyingly high pitched.  When I stood up, it went away.  Sit down and there it is.  After looking and searching her office, I finally found it. 

On a shelf, at head height when seated, was a battery operated digital alarm clock with a barely readable display.  I put my ear to it and confirmed that I had found my culprit.  I removed the near dead batteries and left my calling card: a ""While You Were Out"" memo with my extension number and a lollipop.

She called me after ecstatic that the noise was gone.  I directed her to look at her shelf and explained.  We had a good laugh and she decided to just throw it away.

I've always enjoyed troubleshooting and puzzle solving.  This one stuck with me as it was tricky to isolate and actually had nothing to do with the IT equipment.",1,1626970601
2396,"""It hurts when I do this."" ""Then don't do that!""","I'm going to remain vague about product details because my industry is very recognizable.  I am on a team whose job is to train technicians for our dealerships and assist them with troubleshooting the various products.  

One afternoon I answere the phone and find myself talking to Sparky.  Sparky is a nice guy who is stronger than your average bear but nowhere near as smart.  He has a load of stories involving local wildlife and dive bars that all end with him getting his ass kicked.  

He was working on a new setup and we had several inputs and outputs that weren't lining up.  No problem.  We just have to move several wires and then test the voltages to make sure everything lines up correctly.  I relay instructions to Sparky and wait for him to finish.  

After a while I notice this task is taking more time and curse words than it should, so I ask what's going on.  He replies one wire keeps slipping and shocking him.  I lay my head down on my desk and take a deep breath.  On one hand he deserves this for deciding he could move live wires.  On the other hand, if he kills himself, my phone number will show as the last one he called.  So I say, ""If it's shocking you, TURN THE POWER OFF! And stop touching live wires!""  

He replies that it's OK because it's only 120.  I say I'm going to stop helping him until he follows my instructions.  I hear the disconnect go clunk and were were able to finish without anymore issues.  

Needless to say, his dealership got a strongly worded letter that Sparky was to attend our upcoming intro training school and that was nonnegotiable.",1,1626969855
2397,Printer add that took 3 months,"I was reading another post about printers and I brought back this from memory. 

This was back around 2007. 

I was supporting a product running on virtual mainframe on Solaris servers. One of the larger clients added a new Blazerjet 9100 printer in overseas India office. they were currently running the same printer in some domestic offices so we didn't expect any big issues. I worked initially internally through their main customer service rep but she was very pregnant at the time and went out on leave before anything got done.  

I got network to open port 9100 to the remote IP. That took around a week.

I got system engineer to add printer to the production and test servers. That sucked up another week. 

At that point I was able to confirm printer setup and test connectivity. Everything was looking good. 

I got the printer added to the virtual mainframe and scripts I needed it in for printing. 

Depending on how the printers and OS interacted I knew you would usually either run the print job through postscript or directly to a 'lp' command. So I ran a couple initial test prints setting with some basic settings I use to start testing. 

Reports were printing but the formatting was off. I was going through manually setting font pitch and vertical spacing and all this stuff that I usually never touched. 

I was running test prints domestically and everything responded exactly like I thought it should and reports were perfect. 

This is just mainframe reports, so there aren't any pictures or anything really that should be a big problem. 

The problem stretched on for weeks. Dealing with domestic and overseas you run into issues when you have people in the office and the time between testing something and when anyone even gets back to you. 

About a month in we even got a big conference call together for troubleshooting. We even had a rep from the printer company on the call. Same results. I would print to a domestic printer, no issues.  I would print to the new printer in India and it wouldn't look right. 

I went back and started going through Solaris printing and I found out you could generate a PCL file (what is sent directly to the printer) by using a debug switch in the 'lp' command. Then I found a PCL viewer that I could use on my PC. 

Finally I could reproduce the print locally. Although I didn't know the problem yet. 

Looking through what was being sent to the printer I noticed that the vsi (vertical space increment) wasn't getting set the way I need it to be. Although it was fine for the domestic printer.

It was right around then when the formerly pregnant worker came back to work and she was amazed we were still talking about this same freaking printer. 

So I was tracing the print request through the model script for that type printer and found the offending line. 

Since this was India they were printing to A4 paper and there was a line in the model script that hardcoded settings. 

You would think that would be the end of it but no. I then had to proved to the systems engineer why I should be allowed to remove that line from the model script. 

Once everything finally got changed the reports printed fine and I wasted 3 months getting a printer added.",1,1626968850
2398,"I never used Excel before, didn't know that's how it worked....","My Hell Desk horror story of the week:

We recently had an employee transfer from our least technically-apt dept to a slightly more technically-apt dept. This always results in an annoying few days for me because our managers firmly believe that the ""T"" in ""IT"" stands for ""Trainer""; they give their new hires a super broad overview of what to do and when they can't figure it out the managers tell them to put in a help desk ticket so I can teach them the basic computer functionality they should have already known before being considered for employment... but I digress.

So almost immediately I get a ticket from New User ($NU) that he can't open a spreadsheet. I go thru the basics, ie- any error messages, you don't have permission, file locked, excel not responding, yadda yadda. Nope, user just clicks the file, waits a few minutes and nothing ever happens. I remote into the users computer and have them show me what's going on. I see the user open file explorer, browse to directory, I see the mouse move over to a spreadsheet, I see the file highlight when clicked, and then... nothing. mmmKay. I put a blank excel file into that directory and tell the user to open it. Same thing, nothing happens. Have them copy the file to their desktop and try to open, still nothing. Have the user open a word doc in that directory, it works... ok now I'm intrigued. Have the user launch excel from the taskbar, go to File &gt; Open and open the spreadsheet, that works. Now I'm befuddled.

I open the file on my computer to make sure it's not corrupt in some weird way that would only affect how it's opened (hey, stranger things have happened)... Checked users permissions (file, directory, and account) even tho I didn't think that would be the case since the file does actually open inside of excel. SFC, DISM, repair Office installation, all to no avail. Restored a previous version of the file from backup, nothing. I tell the user to go to lunch and meanwhile I will uninstall/reinstall office from scratch. User leaves and I hop on their computer, for shiggles I give 1 last attempt to open this spreadsheet before I uninstall office... and it works immediately. I'm dismayed, discouraged, and confused, but who am I to question when things randomly decide to work properly. It still hasn't occurred to me that I missed something vital. I notify $NU that problem is solved.

A little while later I get a response that it's not fixed, $NU still can't open excel files. What the actual eff? Mad Googling ensues... Whilst I question all of my life choices, I get another reply:

$NU: hey i fixed it, you can close my ticket out

$ME (in unfathomable disbelief): wait, what?? seriously?!?!

$NU: yeah lol, i didnt know i had to double click excel files to open them. i've never used it before.

$ME (just now starting to realize what was happening): what do you mean you didn't know to double click?

$NU: well i never used excel before, when i open it from the taskbar i just click it once, i thought that's how you opened the files

$ME: but.... but i watched you open a word doc?

$NU: yeah that's how I always open word, i just double click the file i need and word opens. i didnt know excel did that

$ME (summoning my inner Tuvok): that is...completely illogical. so all the times i told you to open a spreadsheet and was watching you....you just clicked them once?

$NU: yeah lol sorry about that

Head, meet desk; Desk, meet head. I never actually considered that it would be possible that someone would be single-clicking a file instead of double clicking it. And after I picked my jaw up off the floor, I couldn't believe I actually had to explain to a user that to open files they need to be double-clicked....all files...for every program...all the time.... FOR THE PAST 30+ FUCKING YEARS.

All in all, I learned a valuable lesson from this. No matter how long you've been shackled to the Hell Desk, no matter how much you think you know about everything, no matter how jaded you've become with stupid users over the years, NEVER EVER overlook the absolute simplest, stupidest, mind-numbingly basic troubleshooting steps. Because users are fucking stupid, and you need to be able think equally as fucking stupid.

TL;DR: A user didn't know they had to double-click files to open them and I'm an idiot because I didn't catch on to what they were doing wrong sooner.",1,1626965286

So I get a call while at lunch down the street marked urgent from the head of oncology. So I hurry to finish lunch in the span of the 5 minutes it takes me to finish eating and rush back the building he has called 3 more times for an update.

So I arrive on the scene the doctor is flustered and informing me he has an important meeting to get to and the printer just won’t work and he doesn’t understand why. Keep in mind he has 4 other printers in the area but wanted to use the one in his office. I check the printer it says “Please Load Paper” I load paper it immediately starts printing. I inform the doctor and he tells me “It’s not my job to know if there’s paper in the printer, it’s my job to save lives”

At that moment I had to decide weather I wanted to keep my job or punch this old man in the head. I chose to keep my job and told him “okay well there’s paper now” and walked away. I think about this interaction often because I don’t know how you can go to medical school for all those years but can’t read that the printer has no paper.

Karen: When I send emails out as myself, the customers reply and it goes to the customer service inbox. I need this changed NOW this is very annoying, how am I expected to work like this?! 

Me: You sent it as yourself?

Karen: YES! I need this to stop NOW! How am I supposed to know when my customers respond to me!

This Karen selects New Email, SELECTS THE CUSTOMER SERVICE ACCOUNT in the from box and hits send.

I cringe, face-palm and groan internally all at once, patiently point out that she has two options to send emails from and she just needs to make sure her account is selected and that it will default to the last box chosen.

After I explained all this, she replies: Oh, that's right, I forgot I had to do that...

2406,It’s Universal,"While I’m not in IT, this does involve support for technology.  Happened earlier in the night.

Our shop prepares the various steel pieces you might see at a construction site to build… buildings.  Had a brief power outage (very brief, power came back on less than a minute later), not uncommon but can differing effects on the machines.

Less than 30 minutes later, co-worker tracks me down.  The saw he was running would not start the blade since the outage, and wondered if I knew how to fix it.  Having trained this guy on the saw, I knew this was something new for him, so I went over to have a look.

Sure enough, trying to start a cut fails to start the blade.  Flip the machine over to Blade Tracking mode to see if it the blade or wheels were jammed.  Nope.  Blade can start just fine, machine just couldn’t do it for an actual cut.

Not having any options or settings to play with, I went with the old standard.  Turned the machine off, waited a few seconds (power has to clear for a true restart), and turned it back on.  Worked like a charm.

2407,"That isn't a feature, that is a fire","Heard a story today that made me recall something from what I was in college working IT. Thought others might get a chuckle from it.

In the early 2000s I was working IT for the university I attended. One day we were short our normal people that answer phones and put in tickets so I was covering the phones for an hour since things were slow in the repair room. I got what was the oddest call I ever dealt with. Given that this is 20 years ago I don't recall everything verbatim but do recall that this is very close to how it went.  

Me: Thank you for calling the IT department, how can I help you today.

Professor: Hi this is Professor Smith. I need to know what button to press on my keyboard to turn off the smoke from my computer. 

Me: I am sorry, can you say that again I don't think I heard you correctly there.

Professor: Yes there is black smoke coming from my computer. My entire office is full of smoke and it is going down the hall bothering people in other offices. I have had several people come complain about it. I need to know which key on the keyboard I need to press to turn off the smoke so that I can get my work done. 

Me: Well... That isn't a feature sir. That is your computer on fire. I need you to unplug it right away and move anything flammable away from it. It will take me about 45 seconds to get across campus and to your office. 

Professor: I can't turn if off, I am working on stuff that is very important at the moment. I just need to turn the smoke off. I don't know what button I pressed that turned the smoke on but I just need to know how to turn if off. 

Me: Sir that is a fire. That is no button that you can press to turn on smoke, that is not a feature that any computer has or would ever need. Please I need to hang up and get over to you before you burn the building down, I need you to please turn the computer off. 

At this point my supervisor is standing there from having heard me talking on the phone and was wondering what was going on. I finally told the professor I needed to give him to somebody else real quick. Handed my supervisor the phone and gave him a quick overview of the issue and told him to deal with this guy while I go stop a building from burning down and took off running. 

I get to the building where the professor was at, I run up the 3 flights of stairs and as soon as I open the door there is a haze in the hall. Somebody just points the direction I need to go. I get down the hall  and tell the professor tells me that his computer shut itself off now and he can't get it to turn back on. His tower was under stacks of papers so I am surprised they didn't have something other than just burning electronics in there. Even as I was unplugging everything he still couldn't grasp that there is a fire or something burning inside of his computer. He even made a comment to somebody that came in to see if everything is ok that he doesn't know why we would give people computers that you can turn smoke off and on, he never had a computer like that before and that doesn't make any sense to have them smoke for. Even that person was puzzled as to why he thought that was just something build into the computer and couldn't grasp it was on fire. 

I live to think that all these years later he is still trying to find the button he pressed to turn on the smoke and how some mean guy in IT wouldn't just tell him to turn if off without making some big deal about it.",1,1626915376
2408,Pretty sure my customer is schizophrenic…,"I had a repeat customer come in the shop today. I’ll keep this story short and sweet. She said her iPhone screen was no longer working and that she needed her data moved to her new iPhone she just bought. The first thing I noticed on her original iPhone is that the screen protector was very badly damaged. Her issue was that touches weren’t being recognized and that was keeping her from being able to put in her pass code. I immediately peeled her bad protector off and like magic her screen worked again (underneath the protector the screen was still golden).

After this she told me that she still wanted to have all of her data copied over. It seemed a little pointless to me but the shop had been slow and I was happy to help her out. I filled out her work order and sent her on her way. The work order contains contact information from the customer and passwords that I may need while accessing the device. On this paper she wrote her Apple ID password. Upon trying out her password later in the data copy process, I realized that she gave me an incorrect password. 

Immediately, I contacted her and gave her a couple options. She could give me a couple more suggestions as to what it might be or we could reset her password. She then told me that she thinks that she knows what it is. I asked if she wouldn’t mind reading it off to me so that I could finish the transfer job. Her response was that she didn’t feel comfortable telling me over the phone because someone is listening. After that she told me that she would drive to a pay phone and call me that way she couldn’t be tracked. 10 minutes later I get an anonymous pay phone call. Apparently she didn’t feel comfortable telling me over the pay phone either, and would instead drive 30 minutes back over here to tell me it in person. 

When my customer finally arrives, she pulls out a sheet of paper that has scribbles all over it. Picture an insane asylum cell wall if they handed sidewalk chalk to its inhabitants. Her actual password was like 30 characters long in handwriting that wasn’t even close to legible. I asked her to read it off to me so that I didn’t mistakenly copy down the wrong password. She hesitated, looked around my empty lobby and in a very hushed tone, she finally read it off to me. I then very simply finished the job and sent her on her way.

Honestly I feel bad for her. She is an older lady, who is seemingly afraid of everything when it comes to technology. Last time I saw her, she faked a knife in the foot injury to avoid picking up her laptop. I can’t tell you what her reasoning was, but it comes off as a little crazy to me.",1,1626911381

Normal Support was ""oh you have still use XP sorry we can´t help you, please upgrade your Windows. Windows is no longer officially supported and is prone to security Problems""

Most Agencies were understanding and upgraded their systems, but on customer didn't get the sign.

He tried over and over again to get support for Software but was always denied. 

Until he wrote the CEO personally complaining and Demanding that ""we need to do our job and what is he paying for."" despite the old Windows system he used and multiple calls where he is informed to use a new Windows Version.

This Customer was known in the company as very special.

Some Meetings were held to discuss how we deal with this customer. Until the CEO desited F\*\*\* it and terminated the Contract and Kicked him out.

The best part was the Mail he sent with the Contract Termination. 

I quote the specific line that makes me remember it to this day. 

""Despite being denied support multiple times from our Techs, that we no longer support Windows XP let it put me in words you can understand.

You can't win the World Cup in Racing in a Ford with a broken engine.

Until you upgrade your system the the new standard we no longer what business with you"" 

Since then we never heard of him and this story makes me smile to this day. 

maybe i come around and tell more story like that one time wrote a customer ""F\*\*\* yourself""",1,1626896447
2413,Remote user receives Trust Relationship Has Failed errors...A wonderful self-own.,"We have a sales guy. He's a great guy, but he thinks he knows more than he does and can kind of get a few steps ahead of the technology, if you know what I mean. He's got a company-provided laptop on which he VPN's into the network, even though he rarely needs to do so. Most of his work is done with web apps. The computer is domain-joined because he does come into the office a couple times a month. 

This morning he called me to say that he's getting ""Trust relationship has failed"" errors on login. This has never happened in our environment, at least since I've worked here. So of course I want to blame the user, right? I tell him it's no big deal, he doesn't really use any domain resources, he can just power through. Except he can't, because this also comes up when his computer locks after being idle for 10 minutes, and it won't let him unlock it. 

Also this morning, the limited number of people who come into the office used the conference room. There's a domain-joined PC in there as well, which also started throwing the ""trust relationship"" error. Okay, now this must be my fault somehow. I did recently add a domain controller. Could something have gone wrong there? 

Through the magic of VPN I walked the sales guy through disconnecting from the domain, restarting and logging in as local admin, then rejoining the domain. Some snags here and there, but it worked.

I wanted to remote his computer to check a couple little things, basically making sure his desktop redirection still worked. I use LogMeIn for remote assistance. My naming convention in that tool is COMP-123 (John Doe). I usually enter in the user's first name to find them in the list of available computers. But this time I typed in the PC's host name...and received two results. The laptop and the conference room PC. Both of which I set up. Idiot. 

So now myself as Tier 1 can blame write a snarky ticket to myself as Sysadmin for making such a stupid blunder. Moron admin used the same computer name twice and caused a loss of about an hour of a salesman's time.",1,1626894781
2414,Blue screen,"Hi,
I am not so much a tech support guy, but a programmer in automation. 20 years ago I had a big project, where I had to develop a pc application for an end-ofline inspection/calibration. Pretty complex setup, with multiple servomotors, cameras and um-accuracy. Worked several months on it and finally it went in production. I trained the personel, and they would start using it the next day, early shift.
Next morning about 5h30 I get a call that nothing is working. Big panic because of production stop. They can't see the usual screens and they tell methat there is a blue screen with some english text on that they don't understand.(client is dutch company). They have no idea what to do, did multiple hard reboots and needed my assistance. So as this was pre-teamviewer, I jump in my car for a 2 hour drive.
As I walk in, I can see the blue screen from far, but it was the typical windows 2000 background color, with a message in the center that the local password had expired and needed a new password.",1,1626892348

2417,Working with the police,"I worked for a village government for about 5-1/2 years and part of my job was supporting the police.  As most people are aware, the cops generally have a laptop in their squad that connects them to dispatch, lets them look up drivers licenses and plates, etc.  In order for this system to work properly, they had to logon to Windows with a specific logon different from their own account.  For example, if the officer's name was John Doe, his own username might be ""jdoe"", but to logon to the squad computer, he had to use ""gvpolice"".  

Well, one day, an officer drives over to my building and tells me that his system isn't working properly.  I walk out to his squad and notice that he's logged in as himself.  I remind him that he has to logon with the ""gvpolice"" account (which he has done every day for at least 3 years, mind you).  He apologizes for forgetting and I tell him no problem.  The next day, he pays another visit complaining about the same problem.  Again, I note that he has logged in with his own account instead of ""gvpolice"".  He again apologizes, logs in properly and goes on his way.  THIS HAPPENED THE NEXT TWO DAYS.  After the fourth time, I contacted the deputy chief because I'm wondering if this guy is fully with it and maybe he shouldn't be walking around with the ability to use deadly force.  I guess he figured it out because I didn't hear from him on that issue again.",1,1626883812
2418,There's more than one dip stick here,"(Been a while; sorry if this isn't allowed.)

I used to work for a small engine and lawn equipment call center. While we weren't typically allowed to intstruct customers on complex repairs, we were mostly parts sales and light troubleshooting.

One day, a sweet, older gentleman calls in. I get his information, and he starts explaining his issue.

&gt; My engine is spewing white smoke like crazy!

Okay. White smoke means burning oil.

""Huh. Did you recently change the oil in your lawn mower?""

&gt; Yeah! 

""Did you fill it to the ""max"" line on your dip stick?""

&gt; Uhh... I wasn't sure how much to add, so I topped it off.

_Oh no._

""By... 'Topped it off', do you mean... Filling it all the way full?""

&gt; Yeah! Did I do something bad?

For those of you not aware, while oil does provide lubrication to engines, it doesn't compress well, and overfilling is bad in different ways than underfilling.

""Possibly. My recommendation is to just... Drain all the oil out of the engine. Do you see the marks on the dipstick I was talking about?""

&gt; Oh! I see them now! Did I ruin my engine?

""Since it started up, probably not.""

&gt; Alright! I'll fill it up correctly.

Me: (Seeing that it is a work number) Hello this is OP.

User: Hey OP this is User down at the office and I just wanted to let you know that the main printer is out of ink. Can you come fix this?

Me: OK? Is the backup printer on the other side of the department broken?

User: Well, no...

Me: And this is an emergency because...

User: Well, I was told to call this number.

Me: This number is my mobile phone and while I will respond to emergencies after hours, it is to be used for emergencies only. 

User: Well this IS an emergency to me. I can not print.

Me: OK since you are declaring an emergency I will call (her manager), wake him up, let him know and be down there in about 20 minutes to change the toner cartridge out for you.

User: Wait why would you call my manager? 

Me: Because you said that this was an emergency and are requiring me to respond to this immediately. I am required to inform the manager of the department when emergencies happen.

User: But ....

Me: (Cutting her off) Oh it is not such an emergency to wake your boss over, but waking me up is fine and dandy? Tell you what then, you have two other options that I have painstakingly planned for to handle just such an occasion. Either you can 1) print to the backup printer on the other side of the department that I requested purchase of and your manager approve the cost of for this exact reason or 2) you can look in the cabinet (labeled supplies) under the printer and find/replace the new cartridge into the printer yourself. It was placed there 4 weeks ago by me when I change out the last toner cartridge during the day during normal business hours just in case the printer needed one when I am not around. I will leave this choice to your professional expertise. Good night.

2420,We're here for you,"A recent post about a good support experience reminded me of Chuck. I dealt with Chuck almost 20 years ago, nice older guy, frequent flier with us. Had lots of issues, most of which were self inflicted but he was nice and tried hard so we helped him.

One evening I'm on the phone with Chuck, its about 7pm on the east coast of the USA. Regular support closed at 6 but we kept one guy on until 8 for west coast callers like Chuck. We had been on the phone for maybe an hour when out of the blue he says ""Oh my god, I forgot to pick up my granddaughter!""

I asked ""When were you supposed to pick her up?""  
""Four o'clock"" he replies, that'd be about the time he started talking to me...

""Don't worry about it Chuck, you go pick up your granddaughter, I'll be here when you get back.""

I didn't hear from Chuck again that night and was a little worried about him so around noon the next day (9am west coast time) I gave him a call. It turned out his granddaughter (who was like 9 or 10) was so mad at him he had to take her out for ice cream and completely forgot about me.

&amp;#x200B;

Over the years Chuck chatted a lot with all the techs (there were 5 of us) and told us all kinds of crazy stories, I wish I could remember more of them but I do remember him telling me about being inside some big machine making a repair to an electrical system and some fool turned the thing on. He took some ungodly voltage through his body and managed to survive.

2422,Fly 400 miles to press the on switch,"When I started medical school, I attempted to keep a small business going on the side - doing small office (doctors, lawyers offices) networking.  Really bad, terrible, awful idea as it turns out.

I had one client in San Francisco  (I lived in Los Angeles) who called me and complained they couldn't access their server.  I was in school and asked her to just go to the server room and tell me what she saw on the display.  Nothing, she said....hitting the space bar on the keyboard didn't do anything either.   So, I asked 'is the power button lit on the server, just to the right of the keyboard in the rack?

She said no.  ""Are there any lights on?"" I asked.  Yes.  (Additional online diagnostics omitted).

OK, could you try pushing the power button?  I figured that somehow the power dropped or someone bumped it or something (full disclosure:  I did not spec, sell, configure or install the server: I inherited it - and it was a top of the line (then) Compaq, not junk.)

She said no, that I needed to come do it - she was scared to.  I told her I was in LA, it was Friday afternoon, and this was the fastest way to resolve the issue.   Nope, wasn't going to do it.

So, I had to leave school, get a hop up to San Francisco, a cab over to the office, get in, walk to the IT closet and push the power button...  It all started right up.

Then get a cab back to the airport (got there by 4 or so), a flight back home (never, ever fly United Airlines unless you like getting screwed) and got home around 1:30 Saturday morning.

I learned then that I had to give my IT career job up - sold my little business to a tech I sometimes used and finished med school....",1,1626830408
2423,"User couldn't install toner, got me a Christmas in England.","Decades ago, I was the IT purchasing person for one of the very largest law firms in the US...we had offices across the US and in England, and a couple in Asia as well - I had to arrange for all their IT equipment (this was in the days when law firms were just starting to put a computer on everyone's desk, and everything was done on Word Perfect under DOS.

So, it's a couple of days before Christmas, and I got a call from the office manager in the London office...Their laser printer needs a new toner cart, and they're out.  And, they have  a HUGE (Multi-billion dollar) acquisition deal going down, and needed to get it fixed...  

So, I asked who usually replaced them and she said they had a deal with some local guy who would come and install them when needed - for some outrageous amount of money (he charged GBP350 for the toner cart and another 100 and change for 'installation', roughly a thousand US dollars....which was totally outrageous for a single toner cart.  But, he had already left for his holiday.  No, couldn't find anyone else (things were already shutting down, etc).  No clue how to install a cart.

Long story short, the only alternative was for someone to fly to London with a toner cart and install it.

Well, I decided that if that's what they wanted, I'd do it.  I wasn't the tech, but I could certainly hum the tune and dance the steps...  So, I grabbed a couple of toner carts (after verifying the model - I think we had Laserjet II and Laserjet IIIs in the offices), and the fastest way for me to get to London was via a bizjet - which I met at Hollywood Burbank Airport, and we flew to London (11 hours later).  So, I get picked up and delivered to the office, made a point of showing the staff how to install the cart, left them a spare and I was done.

Except, I'm stuck in London.  On Christmas weekend - not just Christmas, but Boxing day as well.

And there were no flights back to the land of free...all booked up.  Called the IT director, and told him I'd be delayed - he said no problem, just get a hotel and stay available for any issues that may come up.

So, three days in the Mandarin Oriental hotel...Room service.  Had to buy some personal items, which went on the company.. The flight back home?  The first seat I could get was on British Airways, first class...

All in all, the toner carts that I would buy for maybe $45 each cost the firm well over $150,000 - those bizjet flights aren't cheap.  Considering the client paid for it, no problem.   The firm billed in excess of $10 million for the work (mine, and of course the lawyers..)...   And when I got home, I was on vacation anyway since it was between Christmas and New Years...

2424,"I Forgot The Cardinal Rule, or, 4 minutes Of Google Could Have Saved Me 4 Hours Of Work","I run my own infrastructure at home because it's a great way to keep my UNIX skills current. I run old, badly architected spare parts infrastructure because that's been my professional paradigm for most of my career. To wit: ""Here's no budget. Make a system work with spare parts that are 10 years out of date."" At home budget consists of what I can get away with buying that's under the ""Never spend more than $100 without consulting your SO"" threshold. I have 2 servers: a Dell Latitude laptop circa 2013 and a Toshiba Satellite laptop circa 2010. Hey, Linux doesn't care (but will NOT run on the Dell Inspiron laptop from 2007...THAT came with Windows Vista, and attempts to install CentOS 7 result in crashes). Both servers are running CentOS 7 that I religiously patch with a yum update because I've seen too many problems caused by an out-of-date OS.

So The Toshiba acts as an NFS server and hosts Plex, and its aging 5400 RPM SATA drive serving as the boot disk has started throwing bad block errors. So far, nothing unrecoverable, but it's only a matter of time before my aging hardware betrays me. Browsing the Plex library incurs a noticeable lag as the spinning platter struggles to keep up with the load. I convince the wife that I need to make an upgrade purchase of an SSD.

The upgrade plan is simple enough: Plug the SSD into a SATA-to-USB bridge and plug it into the server. Partition the drive and use cpio to copy /boot from the old drive to the new one. Run grub to install the boot loader on the new drive. Turn the second partition into a PV, add it to the root volume group, and use pvmove to migrate the data live. The shut the server down, swap the drive out, and boot it back up. Easy-peasy, I've actually done similar things with AIX servers and it's a piece of cake. Everything goes fine until I invoke the pvmove command. I'm doing this part from an ssh session because I don't feel like standing in front of the rack where the server sits. My session just kind of goes dead. And I get that sinking feeling. I check the server's console by flipping open the lid. KERNEL. PANIC.

It must a transient failure, right? I reboot, and the server crashes on startup. Kernel Panic. I boot from the new drive. Same result. It must be the bridge, right? I remove the old drive from the server, plug it into the bridge, and hook it up to the Dell. I can see the drive. The system isn't happy about the missing PV. I take the SSD, plug it into an enclosure that previously housed a different SSD, and plug it into the Dell. I can see the drive right up until the kernel panics and crashes the Dell. The sinking feeling intensifies. I manage to forcibly remove the SSD PV and effectively abort the pvmove. Verify IO to the new drive works ok with dd. Add the PV back in to the VG. Try to pvmove again and SONUVABITCH it's another kernel panic! I'm about 3 hours in to what should have been a 15 minute process followed by an overnight data copy process that would have run just fine in the background. I struggle to cancel out the pvmove, but now I can't because the Dell's LVM KNOWS about both PVs and refuses to let me remove the new drive. LVM is NOT happy with my attempts, and I've got a sdinking feeling that I've managed to corrupt the VGDA, as pvdisplay is giving some WEIRD results. If LVM sees both PVs, it tries to resume the pvmove, and BANG! Kernel Panic.

So I do the sensible thing and try to determine if anyone has run into this problem before, and if so, how did they fix it? A quick Google of the following terms from the kernel panic error message: ""mirror\_merge dm\_merge\_bvec linear\_merge \_\_bio\_add\_page""  


""Known LVM issue - Kernel panic Red Hat Linux Enterprise 7.9  
All Red Hat Linux Enterprise 7.9 (RHEL 7.9) images which running a kernel version greater than 3.10.0-1160.10.1.el7 are affected by a kernel panic during execution of a pvmove command!""  


...HEY! That's the kernel version I'M running! In fact, I had updated to that version about a week prior!  


I plug the drives back into the Toshiba and boot from a previous kernel version. After about an hour I manage to undo the way I've managed to mangle the LVM and get it to see BOTH PVs without marking both of them missing (old drive said that the new drive was missing, and vice-versa). Once this is fixed, the system automagically resumes the pvmove. The data migration takes all night, but runs smoothly. I remove the old drive from the VG and shut down. I then use this opportunity to correct some filesystem issues. Like the time I forgot to mount the filesystem I was spooling my backup to and wound up increasing /tmp to like 20GB before I discovered that the backup process was writing into the root filesystem. Shrink that back down to a respectable 2GB. Or the fact that Plex writes into /var, and it should really have its own filesystem. A quick drive swap and I boot from the SSD!  


Except I can't. /boot can't be found. Because I created a NEW /boot filesystem and used CPIO to copy the contents of the OLD /boot into it...and forgot that RedHat likes to mount /boot by UUID. THAT problem only took my 30 minutes to figure out. The system is now up and performs MUCH better with an SSD.  


  
TLDR - System crashed during what was supposed to be a routine data migration task. I spent HOURS trying to get it to work, only to discover with a quick Google search of the error that it was a known bug and a simple ""Use the last version"" would have saved me those hours of frustration.",1,1626812874

I worked for a mortgage company as their only helpdesk guy.  I covered every office on the East coast and my average ticket was typically about user error, but this one to my surprise seemed legitimate.

2427,New low: Sales pitch via ticket,"Can’t say I’ve seen this before. Though I suspect this is a more common occurrence than I am aware of. 

Some of our acquisitions over the last few years have had MSPs providing their support. As we can we’ve been letting those support contracts expire and not renewing. A few of them we’ve reupped only because the MSP hosts servers or equipment still in use and we’ve not had time to migrate them to our own platforms.  

I’m one of the listed point of contacts for one of our MSPs, so any time a ticket is opened on MSP’s side for our account I get an email. This morning I get one of these email notifications.

&gt;Subject: New Ticket #123786: Protect your virtual servers with Replication Services powered by MSP’s Replication Platform^(TM). 

It’s a real ticket in their system. This is not just a weirdly formatted email meant to look like a ticket to get engagement. I checked the MSP ticket portal and it’s there. The entire body of the ticket is just a sales pitch for one of MSP’s services. 

The best line in all of it:

&gt;You can request more information about this service by replying to this ticket. Our Support Team can answer your questions or put you in touch with our Customer Success Team. 

And at the bottom of the ticket:

2428,The phantom faulty heat sensor.,"A story recommended for here by the kind folks at r/militarystories 

Original story been edited with audience consideration in mind. 

Tl;dr at the end.

The Aim-9L Sidewinder is a heat seeking missile that uses an argon inert gas canister to cool the onboard computer while its playing tag. 

A couple fun facts: the canisters are replaced as the pilots train, getting a target lock on their counterparts and use up the gas. The canisters are installed hand tight and will self tighten in flight. To address this, there is a special tool for this one job. However this tool is often not used and a screwdriver and some torque will loosen it if you twist on the steel cable attached to the canister. And lastly, the Sgt. in charge of those canisters will complain to your supervisor, or higher, that the cables keep coming back chewed up and need replacing because people are not using the tool. 

One day the pilot gets a warning light. Missile overheating. When he lands the Missile is removed. The argon canister looks good, it's full. A functional check is performed on the Missile rail and aircraft. It all looks good. They swap out the canister and the aircraft is ready to go. 

The next time if flies, it happens again. The missile is removed and replaced, the Missile rail is taken off, replaced, and inspected. The the new rail and aircraft are system checked. The argon canister is inspected. No fault is found anywhere. Must be a ghost in the machine. The next time the plane flies, no problems. Good. 

But it happens again. Same plane, new Missile, new rail launcher, different canister. So they start suspecting the fault might be in the aircraft wiring itself. Or they did, until the warning popped up in a completely different aircraft, with all different equipment. 

And again, it wasn't every flight. They would get a warning light, run their checks, find nothing, and the next time, it would work without incident. 

This mystery fail is plaguing our shop for weeks. Significant man hours have been dedicated to finding the cause. Our most experienced crew are beating their heads against the wall trying to make sense of it all. 

And then one guy, happens to mention that he has been installing the argon canisters and then backing it off 1/2 to 3/4 of a turn before closing the panel because they self tighten and are hard to remove after flight, you don't think that has something to do with it do you?

I wish I could have been in the room for that bombshell. The confusion, frustration, and rage must have been palpable. Looking back after the fact, with all the answers in place, the reason seems obvious, the person doing the maintenance is the variable that most easily travels from plane to plane. But our diagnostic team did not have the imagination to fathom that someone would just stop doing the job the right way, the way they were trained, the way it has done it for years. 

I don't know if he got any official demerits against him for not following technical data, i imagine so, but I do know he could not sit for a week, and was measurably lighter after that ass chewing he received.

In any job, not just the military, if you have an idea, or if you think there is a better way of doing things, let someone know. At any point in your career, there is someone who knows more and has done it longer, get their feedback. 


Tl;dr: a jackass chose to do his job wrong one day because it was easier. Had us chasing our tails for weeks trying to find the problem.",1,1626798944
2429,Snake!,"Well I hope this isn't bending the rules too much,  as I am the one calling into tech support,  and thought you all might enjoy a user poking some fun at himself.

This literally just happened this morning. 

I work as a feild guy for a large US communications company.  This morning I was having issues connecting to our VPN.  I tried some basic troubleshooting before raising my hands deciding its time to call IT.   As I've been in this situation a couple of times I knew there might be a need for me to plug into the network for them to connect to my computer,  so before I make the call I drive to a local site where if needed I could do so.  

Being as I cannot work without VPN, my call is instantly escalated to T2, and after a brief wait my call is connected. 

Itgirl:  thank you for holding this is itgirl, can you please verify your name and employee ID
 
Me: yes this is the Cur, employee ID is C1234

Itgirl: thank you Mr Cur,  it says here that you cannot connect to the VPN, is that correct 

Me: yes that's correct 

Itgirl: can you please verify your computername, VPN and token version 

Me: yes it's computernane678, strongvpn version 102345, token is tokencorp version 98765

Itgirl: those are the current recommended versions.  I see here in software catalog you recently applied for switchcommander to be installed on your computer, did this issue begin after that was installed?

Me: no its only been not working since this morning.

Itgirl:  OK let's do some basic troubleshooting

And we proceed with the basics on and off again,  token and next token. Verify settings in the VPN software, reset pin... No dice.

Itgirl: it looks like we need you to physically plug into the network, I can give you my direct line and you can call me to resume troubleshooting as soon as you can get to an office. 

Me: yeah I figured, if you can hold on, I'm sitting in front of a site I'll log in and let you know as soon as I'm connected. 

Itgirl: that's fine ley me know as soon as you are connected I'll hold, thank you. 

I dial in with spare phone,  now... I haven't been to this site in months, due to covid and other factors, it's been humming along quite well so I've been letting it be.  As I open the door out plops the largest hog nosed snake (aka puff adder) I've seen in a good bit, directly onto my foot. 

Me:  shrieking 'AHHHHHH AHHHHHH AHHHHHH SNAAAAAKE!' completely forgetting itgirl is on the phone,  and in one single moment jump back and for what ever reason throw my phone at it. 

Snake looks at me like What in the actual Eff dude,  and proceeds to puff and hiss at me. 

Suddenly I hear itgirl in my earpiece: Mr cur, Mr Cur is everything OK,  do I need to call, thecursboss??

Me quickly remembering I'm on the phone with Itgirl:  sorry about that Itgirl, I wasn't expecting that. 

Itgirl: Are you OK? Is... that.... the snake I hear? 

Me:  yes I'm OK, sorry about screaming in your ear.  Yeah it's pretty pissed off at me... Sheepishly mention I threw my phone at it. 

Itgirl:  well don't get bit,  you can call me back if you need. 

Me:  no no that won't be necessary, it's perfectly harmless just upset that I destroyed its tranquility. 

Itgirl:  OK good,  I was worried I'd have to call bosses,  I'm not sure what the procedure is for snake biting a caller. 

Ive shooed away the snake with a broom now. Pick up phone with freshly shattered screen, but thankfully still holding the call. 

Me:  no no,  no need for bosses, nervous chuckle,  I've sent the snake on its way we can continue as soon as I grab my laptop. 

Itgirl:  OK good,  and chuckles. 

I plug in, and we resolve the VPN issues with a forced synchronization to the server. 

Me: thanks itgirl it's working again. 

Itgirl: no problem, hope you don't find anymore snakes today. 

Me: chuckles yeah me too. 

Itgirl:  BTW you scream like a girl. 

Lmfao. 


Well issues are resolved and my lunch break is over.  Time to order a new phone... I hope throwing it at a snake will be covered under 'accidental damage' .  And itgirl if you are out there,  my apologies again for screaming in your ear.",1,1626798715

Her: Hi, well.. I think I did something to the laptop.  
Me: Oh my, what did you do?  
Her: I just wanted to increase the volume, and as I pressed the button it wrote something like ""Putting on standby"", and it turned off!

2431,notebook worries,"A little bit of back story:

m-arx, your friendly sysadmin, was contacted in about August of 2020 by HR that a new person will on-board in 10 days in a remote location. They informed me that he was joining the company from another company in the group.

When I said I don't have any hardware on site, as everybody needed notebooks for their pandemic-related working from home activities, they replied that he still has his old notebook and is able to work.

My mistake: I did assume his old work notebook and did not wonder if $oldcompany would not want it back.

So I ordered a new notebook for him right away, but that needed \~4 weeks for delivery and then the whole installation / branding shebang. The notebook was postponed for another week and also $sysadmin was busy putting out fires in our production environment.

Four weeks into $user's occupation in the company, I got a call from $manager asking why the person they hired is waiting four weeks for his notebook. I told them about the lead time and that the notebook, which was delivered in the meantime, was ready for installation and that I was under the impression that he was able to work with ""his old notebook"".

Another week of firefighting goes on and the installation task, which is mostly automated but needs a few touches here and there, was not high on my priorities. After all, he was able to work.

So I got a call from $manager (who got promoted to $angrymanager) asking me, why $user has to work with OWA on his personal notebook and where $\*#! (explicit) his notebook was stuck. I explained myself as I was under the impression that he would be able to work on the notebook from $lastcompany and promised them to finalize right away, which I did. The next day  took the notebook to the post office and sent it to the hands of $user in $remotelocation.

After that I did not hear about the topic for two weeks. Everybody seemed to be happy...

Then one day $user calls me and says he cannot login to the notebook, it would not accept his password. I found out that he is working from home and changed his password while the notebook was in transport. So I told him to login with his old password until he is at $remotelocation, or any other location of the company. Which worked. But of course, Outlook being Outlook, it popped up credential request on every start and $user was slightly annoyed.

He vented his feelings on the phone.

Twice.

I told him that this would go on until he managed to get to a site of the company so the notebook is able to talk to the domain.

When he finally did (a few more venting phone calls to $manager and $sysadmin happened in between), we again had radio-silence for another three weeks, maybe.

That's when his notebook started throwing Bluescreens (which would result from a damaged RAM module, as we later found). So I told him those can happen, but if it gets annoying, he can send in the notebook and I can swap the SSD from his notebook into a spare one, which I had also ordered with his notebook.

So we did that and again, radio-silence. Everybody happy. Until today.

I received a phone call - but I was already talking on the other line and it went to voice mail.

Listening in on the recording, $user told me that the replacement notebook I sent, that he never used (what was he using?!), was not working since it would not accept his password and if I remembered the windows password I used for installation.

2433,I should have seen it coming,"I work in a small IT shop with low traffic, and an old person asked me to show him how to use Facebook, Skype, and the internet basically. I help elderly people with these things almost every week, so there was nothing unusual with his request. Because of the shop's low traffic, there's always time to teach the older genaration.

*(My usual tactic with old people is to have them take notes and not only watch me do everything, but also try it themselves. After we're finished, they take a small ""exam"" where I ask them to do the things we talked about, but with me just observing and not helping. This method always worked so far, some of them even got the courage to try new technology stuff themselves, and returned just to proudly show off their new tablet/computer/phone skills.)*

The old man today said he'll understand everything by watching me doing and explaining it, and said he's a fast learner. He even refused to take notes. I didn't want to force him into anything, so I just slowly showed him everything, with asking *""Is it okay so far?""* from time to time. He always said yes, he understood everything, and that it's not that difficult. We sometimes had breaks to let the information sink in.

We spent an hour and a half with going through everything slowly. I honestly believed him that he understands everything. Then he asked me: *""Could you please write all of these on a paper? I don't have my glasses with me and haven't seen anything on the screen, and everything you were saying seemed difficult so I didn't really pay attention.""*

I asked him several times during that 90 minutes if everything is all right, so it's not like he didn't have a chance to tell me to stop. Especially when we were having those 5-minute breaks. I understand that he might have felt ashamed for not seeing well or not understanding things, but if that was the case, where did his shame go when he casually said he didn't listen?",1,1626790597

2436,Snow Crash,"This happened nearly 30 years ago, when 15"" CRT's were considered large and PC's were heavy iron boxes that sat underneath the CRT.  Think IBM PC XT.

I was hired as a programmer in IT for a manufacturing company that, due to the type of things we made, was spread out over a large campus.  The IT department, being the outcasts we were, was down on one end away from the main admin buildings.  Our tech support group was small, and was frequently overwhelmed, so the IT manager made a policy that all calls to the help desk would ring all phones, and we were all expected to answer and help out.  Fortunately that did not last too horribly long, as it made it hard to get primary assignments accomplished.

One day the phone was ringing, and no-one was picking up, so I answered.  The lady at the other end stated that her PC didn't work.  I asked what was going on, and she said that the monitor just had white snow on it, ""like a TV at night"".  I asked her if the PC was turned on, and she replied rather indignantly ""of course it is, there's snow on the screen"".  So I grabbed my jacket and started walking the 1/4 mile from my office to her building.  I walked in and as I approached her desk I saw that indeed, the monitor was displaying snow.  I then reached to the right of her PC and flipped the giant red power switch up to the ""on"" position, waited a few seconds to ensure it was booting and the monitor displayed that, and without a word turned and walked out.  As I passed her I glanced over and saw a look of shock and amazement on her face.",1,1626736638

2440,Backup Groundhog Day,"This is an old one, however it still haunts me until this very day.

Back in the early 2000's I was working as a consultant for an IT consulting company. Customers were mainly small business.

On a certain day I was sent to a new customer. You know the story: go onsite, do some inventory. Check basic client and server stuff, write a report with recommendations to lure them in.

This new potential customer had 2 servers. The oldest one was one of the dreaded NT4 Small Business Servers. Old, but it had large volumes where user data was stored. Next to that one some other IT company installed a brand new NT4 server as a standonline in a workgroup (workgroup name the same as the SBS server's domain, no comment). The new server also had a nice big tapestreamer, so it could backup both itself and the old SBS server. 

Inspecting the backup configuration on the new server I noticed a script was run just right before the daily backup job. Curiosity killed the cat and I had a look into the script, it was just a single robocopy kind of command (sync, with overwrite, no confirmations etc) from one server to the other.

Having a second look, this script did not seem to make any sense to me. Especially the direction of the sync command. I proceeded to interrogate the nearest unsuspecting user: ""If you edit or create any document, is it still there the next day?"". 

The answer killed off parts of my brain and destroyed any faith in humanity or technology: ""Of course not, that's how the system works over here.""

The script just synced (a once, probably manually created) copy back from the new to the old server. Thus effectively each backup job destroying any work done by those poor users...",1,1626728322

2444,It's Always DNS - SSO edition,"I administer a bunch of Moodles for a small tertiary institution in Sydney, Australia. These are currently hosted in M$'s ""Blue Cloud"", with a VPN connection to the campus. The VPN is handy, because it means we can have locally-hosted services interact with the Moodle server as it it is local, and vice versa.

&amp;#x200B;

A few weeks ago, we started getting reports of issues logging in to a couple of Moodle instances. These errors were generated from our Single Sign On setup. Initially these reports were irregular, but then we heard through the grapevine that lots of students were experiencing the issue - they just weren't reporting it via our helpdesk.

&amp;#x200B;

Once we reminded the students that we can't fix errors that we don't know about, and the only way we'll know about issues is if they're reported to the helpdesk, the trickle turned into a flood. We also started to notice an interesting correlation: login errors were happening at times when the VPN had dropped out. The correlation was strong, but we couldn't figure out a causal link.

&amp;#x200B;

I examined the error messages, and they all seemed to contain the phrase ""Could not resolve host: \[sso\_provider\_domain\]"". Why are we getting DNS errors from SSO when the VPN is down?

&amp;#x200B;

Then, today as I was digesting my lunch, it occurred to me that I should check the Moodle server's DNS configuration. It turns out that the server gets its DNS config from the Blue Cloud subnet. When I examined the subnet DNS config, I found four ""internal"" IP addresses listed as DNS servers.

&amp;#x200B;

""Hmm"", I thought, perhaps I should add an ""external"" DNS server to that list. I added Google's [8.8.8.8](https://8.8.8.8) and rebooted the server. No change.

&amp;#x200B;

I then looked again at the list of ""internal"" DNS addresses. Two were in the Blue Cloud subnet IP range. They were for two Active Directory/DNS servers that were hosted in Blue Cloud until a few weeks ago, when they were removed as part of our migration away from cloud-hosted servers. So I removed these now-nonexistent DNS servers from the list and rebooted the Moodle server.

2447,"""This is a laptop"" (yes, they're that stupid)","Funny moment from a week ago, sometimes I take basic knowledge for granted with some people.

Local shop has a summer sale on, most of their sales are refurbished machines and make half-decent machines with a little bit of work.  Part of this summer's was 5 year old chromebooks for $90...  figured I'd grab a cheap spare machine.

Of course, the 3 they have don't even want to charge with 2 different chargers.  Wander over to the ""new"" windows machines they have for cheap, for 2 or 3 years old.  Asked the guy what the specs were on it.

I shit you not, his answer was ""well, that was a chromebook, this is a laptop"" 

**facepalm**

Took 2 tries to actually get the processor, ram, and bus speed.  Can't really blame the guy when most of the clients there don't give 2 shits beyond being able to get online...  and I've been doing this longer than he'd been alive.

Upgrade the ram and a new ssd, boots up in just over a minute to full desktop with windows 10.  Longest part was cloning the drive.

Been a while since I ran into that much of an idiot, and I have repeat customers that just need a new printer set up and thier temporary files cleaned out.",1,1626650971

It will hotspot to others and he has been on the phone to IT for 4 hours with them remoting in trying to get it going, no dice.

I walk in and get the boss ""Michael, can you look at this? These Muppets can't fix shit""

2451,My Favorite moment in the apprenticeship,"I make an apprenticeship in a tech support company where we mainly have companies as a customee but also have some local private customer.

In my second year my boss told me to go to a private customer to set up her workplace with a Laptop, Printer, Monitor and a Dockingstation. I knew the customer before because she works at a company which is also customer.

So i was going to her home with the equipment and rang the doorbell. She said cool that your here and she was really nice to me. She was alone at home with her kids watching some children series and asking me if i wanted to watch the series with her and her kids and wanted to gave me some coffe or water.

When i finished to set up her workplace and showed her how everything works and she can do her stuff, i was ready to go and thanked that she has took our services. She took out her purse and took out 20 bucks and said you made an amazing job and shes very thankfully for my work i made here and at the company she is working.

I was like i cant take that money.

She was like why ? Because of your boss ?

I said ""no or honestly idk if i can take that money or not."" I just dont want money because she will pay for our services and i have my wage."" She said no the money is just for you.

I responded no everything is fine your niceness and courtesy is enough for me.

I had a call with customer to look if the swich is ON or OFF.

Me: ""Is the Switch on the Bottom of the Station ON or OFF ?""

Customer: ""I will have a quick look... I have no Switch that you can turn ON and OFF... I Have just a switch with NO""

Me: I was like hmmmm. Every of these scanners has these switches. And then i was like aaahhh ON backwards mean NO. So i said ""Can you turn the station on 180° ?""

I walk up and offer to help. I look at the mixing. It is not powered on. I look at the back of the mixer and cannot find an on switch which is a bit odd. The guys says well this button says power. I tell him that is the phantom power button for the mics. Yes, we want that turned on but it is not the power switch we need. The panelists walk in.

2454,How did you crash our system?,"In this story, Tech Support called me. 😛

Decades ago I was a manager at a 2 screen movie theater with very poor attendance. How poor? There were days that no one (other than me) showed up. (Yes, I could cover box office, concession, and the projectors … if a customer bothered to show up.)

On one such day, someone came up to box office and asked if they could just buy a bag of popcorn. No movie ticket, just movie popcorn. One thing to understand is that a) concessions are where the vast majority of profit is made (the theater itself saw very little of the box office revenue), and b) managers were thus rated on the ratio of how much money they made in concessions divided by how many tickets they sold.

You probably see where this is going.

No tickets were sold that day, just 1 (overpriced) bag of popcorn.

The next day, tech support from corporate called me to figure out how I caused that particular divide by zero error. (The software was designed to handle $0/0, but not $4.99/0, or however much that popcorn cost.)

I explained the situation, and they understood, so no real drama, just amusement. I never had that happen again, so I don’t know if they fixed the bug. Also, even though they calculated daily ratios, we were actually evaluated on our weekly ratio, not the daily one, and we did sell tickets sometime that week, so they didn’t have to adjust their evaluation criteria for me.",1,1626556237
2455,When you let support know that you can't let them know of the thing.,"So... I just got an email, and it kind of broke my mind... What you need to know for this story, is that it is in an agglutinating language. This means that when you want to say, say ""to the city"", you add a particle to it instead of extra words. 

Linguistics lesson over, a colleague asked a client on chat to send some screenshots to our email address, ""abc@xyz.vw-ra"". The -ra is the way to add the direction particle without merging it into the word, to make it clear that it is not a part of it...

So the client tried to send a mail to ""abc@xyz.vw-ra"" and it bounced back because the domain does not exist. Naturally it does not exist. This is bad enough as it is.... but he let us know of this issue, by sending a screenshot of the failure notification, to abc@xyz.vw ...",1,1626523690

2458,Medical practice operating like well-oiled machine,"Inspired by u/Arbitrary_Pseudonym and IT guy ran off to Malaysia, I decided to share my experience onboarding a large medical practice.  I support a large medical practice that is part of a multi-state network of standardized practices.  They have no in-state IT resources, so I often go onboard practices that have joined.  Most of the time, these are simple jobs that can be done in a day.  This is even true with most large practices, as they tend to have internal IT managing an organized environment.

I get the briefing from the project manager on this clinic.  Large, established practice, 200-250 workstations, and they have internal IT.  I am thinking ""cool, the usual cakewalk...""  Since they close at noon on Fridays, we schedule the job.

A few days before the job, I reach out to their IT guy, just to ask a few questions and see if he will go ahead and roll out the RMM software that makes my onboarding life easier.  When I ask him to create a GPO to deploy the .msi that I will share, he responds ""sure"".  However, it was ""sure"" in that way that actually means ""sure, I do not know what you are talking about, but I will Google it until I do.""

Then I get onsite.

Turns out they are replacing 100+ workstations, so there are a few pallets of Dell desktops currently sitting in the conference room.  The IT guy has not rolled out RMM, and is genuinely perplexed by the concept of group policy.  It turns out that IT guy at this practice, for the past several, were interns that were students at the local university.  The current IT guy had actually been hired from that intern pool.  He spends so much time doing break/fix that he has no time to address any of the core issues, and he asks for some guidance.  Already knowing that this is beyond a one day job, I tell the project manager that we need to reschedule, and I need some of my colleagues that do the same thing in other areas of the state.  I plan to spend the day doing the site survey, that should have already been done.

We start with the domain controller.  There is no OU structure, all 200+ users are just sitting in the default Users OU.  None of them actually login to Windows with those accounts though, they exist only for Exchange.  Everyone logs in to Windows with the user/password of med/med.  Turns out Med is also a domain admin.

All file shares (also on domain controller), are everyone has full control.

I do not even want to get into the annoyance of seeing Exchange 2003, in 2017.

Those replacement desktops?  They are replacing desktops running XP, including the entire billing department.  Every desktop is also being upgraded to dual monitors.  The new Dells only have DP and HDMI ports.  There is not a single monitor in the building with a DP, including the brand new ones they ordered.

Now I am ready to pull out my laptop and start looking at the network.  I see an available jack, and ask him if it is active.  He says ""give me a minute"", and leaves the room.  I thought he was going to enable the port, or maybe patch it to the switch.  No.  He returns, says ""I unplugged the workstation in the next office, you should be good.""  Why did he unplug a workstation to activate that jack?  ""We are out of IPs"".

I start looking at the firewall/switches and discover a nightmare.  It looks like several people have clearly been practicing for their CCNP with a production network.

Servers are on 10.10.1.x, but it is broken up into a bunch of /28-30.  Workstations are on a range of 192.168.1-10, all also broken up into a bunch of /28-30.  DHCP is only serving one /28, and almost all workstations are static.  That all of this was a problem he did not need to have, had not dawned on him.  He just said a networking guy set it all up, and he thought everything was normal.  He did say he frequently encountered issues with sharing where a workstations could see the servers, and had internet access, but they could not see half of the other workstations, or the printer on the desk next to them.

I decided the network was where we needed to start.  I stepped out to call the project manager, to tell him what I found, and get approval for all this out of scope work.  When he finally stops laughing, he tells me to take as long as I need, help is on the way, and everything is on multi-state network's dime.

I stayed the weekend, since it was a fun town, and the next week.  Help showed up, and we turned it into what a network of that size should like.  IT guy ultimately proved useful for running around switching workstations from static to DHCP, or anything else that required running around.  That was about all he could be trusted with.",1,1626465142
2459,99% is not 100%,"This story takes place at a time when I was relatively new to my job. The organization I work at has a public computer lab, for which I am responsible. We were about to undertake a building remodel, and the computer lab had to be moved to a new space while this occurred. Several staff workstations also had to be moved. This normally wouldn't be anything technically difficult, just a fair amount of physical labor. Unfortunately, there were constraints...

The building closes to staff just 15 minutes after it closes to the public. Staff can arrive an hour before it opens to the public. The computer lab had to be fully operational in its original location at closing time the night before the move, and in place and running when we opened the next day. In short, I had an hour to get the move completely done.

I did as much prep work as possible ahead of time, but that wasn't much. Move day came and I was there the minute the door was open to staff. Computers were unplugged, moved, and plugged back in. Networking and power were run to the equipment. Cables were managed. Peripherals were attached. Everything was powered on as staff took to their stations and the public started coming in. I looked around... everything came up as expected! Staff were able to do everything they needed.  I was a sweaty, disheveled mess, but I'd pulled it off! All around the new space, people we happily checking email, playing games, scanning documents and doing whatever else they do.

Then came the complaint. Someone had sent a print job, and was at the print release station trying to get their printout. We charge for printing. They had deposited their quarter in the coin acceptor, but the release station wasn't seeing the payment. I took a quick look, and didn't immediately see anything out of place. It was maybe a minute or two of troubleshooting, but they stood there, vocally expressing their disapproval of my incompetence. Rather than keep them waiting any longer, I did an override to release their print and even refunded their quarter. They thanked me for helping and left happy.

Wait, no, that's not how it went. No, they took their printout, threw the quarter on the ground and said, ""Keep it... I don't know why you even bothered opening today if you can't have things working"" and stormed out. Ah, the rewards of hard work.

If you're curious, it turned out that the print release looks for the payment device on a specific USB port. I had plugged it into the wrong port.",1,1626455030

In April I had a medical emergency and had surgery, and spent 10 days as an inpatient, with the strong pain meds and so on.

Every interaction between a patient and anyone on staff is logged in to the EMR system.  It was physically painful watching people navigate between boxes in the EMR system with the mouse when logging an interaction. It wasn't long at all before I absolutely had to start teaching everyone about the super-simple universal tab-to-jump to the next box. 

The nurses began to come in to talk to me to see if I had any other tips for them. One nurse estimated that the simple tab trick would save them 5-10 minutes per day each, which adds up to hours per year. 

I am in no way involved in training non-IT hospital staff, but now I want to work up some simple tips-and-tricks tutorials for nurses.

If anyone can come up with a better name for this series, I'd love to hear it. It will likely be about 5 or 6 parts.

So, about a month has passed since the last part. We havent heard anything from the user since my boss put him in his place. Life has been good. Until I refreshed my help desk and theres a ticket from... the user's boss! *gasp* I know, his boss is putting in a ticket for him? Well, let's dive into this ticket. 

UB: Hello, User has sent me an email to let me know that hes having some lag issues. He said you have already spoken to him but dismissed his issues. I am also having an issue using VNC to view his screen so I cant really help him with questions. Can you please give him a call and help him out? 

My Boss: oh, what the hell. We already told him there isnt a problem. HangmanMatt, can you call him and see what the problem is? 

Me: *sigh and calls user* Hello User, your boss put in a ticket for you. What seems to be the problem? 

User: The same problem as before. I cant work and that's cutting into my pay. Ive been running speed tests every day and the speed on your vpn is too slow. You need to upgrade it. When I'm off the vpn, I get 300 mbps download and 30 upload. I pay for the top internet plan in my area so it's not on my end. Also, my boss cant view my screen now so he has to help me with screenshots via email. 

Me: ok, one problem at a time, what are the speeds on the vpn? 

User: 50 down and 10 up. I have just started transferring documents to my home computer just so I can do my job and that takes a long time too. 

Me: ok, that's more than sufficient. We have over 100 other users working in the same manner you are. Some are on the west coast, none of them are having the lag issues you are describing. Second, you shouldn't be download documents to your home computer. They contain confidential customer information that needs to stay within our network. Third, you cant do your job from your home computer because our system can only be accessed internally, that's why you remote into a computer that's here on the east coast. 

User: well then fix my lag issue and I wont have to do that. 

Me: fine, walk me through your home network. Are you in wifi? 

User: No 

Me: ok... where is your router. 

User: in my basement 

Me: ok... so you have a cable running up through the floor to your office? 

User: no, my router connects to a 16 port switch that my friend who is a city network engineer gave me. Then those cables run throughout my house to the various rooms. I then have a router that goes to a switch on my desk for my desktop, my printer, and the computer you guys gave me. 

Me: I'm sorry, you have two switches? Do you have two independent ISP connections at your house? 

User: no, just the one. My router in my basement goes to the 16 port switch which goes to my office to my second router, which then goes to my 5 port switch, which goes to my computers. 

Me: who the hell told you to set your home network up like that? That switch is likely an old managed switch that the programming was never cleared out of which you're then running to a second router. Remove the managed switch and the second router and most of your lag should stop. 

User: No, you're wrong, I've had this set up for about 6 months and trying to work for you is the only issues I'm having. I took a networking class and was only a couple classes from getting my degree. I just didnt finish. I know what I'm talking about. 

Me: ok, well, I'm telling you now, that's your problem but since you dont want to remove it, live with your lag. Now, other problem. I'm gonna check your display settings to see if that's causing VNC to fail. *checks display settings* why is your scaling settings changed to 150%? that's what's causing VNC to fail. 

User: dont change the scaling settings, I cant see the screen properly if you change it back. 

Me: you know you can just zoom everything in right? 

User: no, I cant. It's still hard to see if I zoom. I need to use the scaling. 

Me: fine, so you understand your manager cant help you. 

User: I guess. I just wish you knew how to do your job so you could fix me but I guess I'll endure. 

At this point, I'm already done with this guy. I hang up the phone and had to take a walk. After a couple minutes, I return to my desk and update the ticket with everything I did, everything we discussed, and the users refusal to listen. Bare in mind, the user's manager put the ticket in so he saw my reply. 

UB: Why couldnt you get the issues fixed? 

Me: I'm sorry but he refuses to listen when I tell him what the problem is. He thinks he knows more than us and I cant help him. Maybe you can talk to him but he wont listen to us. 

UB: ok, I'll talk to him.

2466,"""IT guy"" ran off to Malaysia","So I recently left an MSP that I worked for for \~2 years. When I first started, I learned that we had recently picked up a client with \~500 users/computers and 6 sites. None too crazy by itself, but...we did not have much documentation on them.

Turns out, we picked them up as a client \~2 months prior, but only heard that the guy was leaving the company a week before he did. Note that he had worked there for 30 years before then. Originally, we were just going to be handling backups, AV, patching, and granting said ""IT guy"" RMM access. Now all of a sudden we were faced with covering *all* their IT needs, and knew very little about their setup. Here's a brief summary of what we discovered after he left to a land of no connectivity:

* He did not provide us with credentials to their switches/firewalls. Turns out they're owned by the company, but managed by the ISP, who also handles their phones.
* We were told about 3 VM fileservers, 3 terminal servers, and 2 DCs, all on one VM host, with one other VM host for redundancy. Turns out there were something like 11 physical servers, 9 DCs, 7 fileservers, 12 terminal servers, and a scattering of other servers that we didn't know shit about. Something like 65-80 server instances in total.
* Every site had various chunks of old, old, OLD equipment, like ancient scanners for proprietary film, and software running on domain-joined windows 2000 and XP machines for looking up indices of documents amongst their literal tons of physical paperwork.
* Faxing was handled by SPA devices living in extremely weird places, including: Above ceiling tiles, in kitchen cabinets, in users' desks, and in various closets by themselves.
* Various users ran XP VMs with DOS emulators which accessed domain fileshares, which were all SMB 1.0 with anonymous access to LITERALLY EVERYTHING.
* Everyday user work was typically done through 3 separate apps, all of which had inter-database communication. Those 3 apps operated off 7 different servers, and tied into two cloud services. No explanation was given as to how they tied together. I was only able to patch together the interconnects by observing network traffic.
* User passwords were all 6-digit, lowercase, with 1 number at the end, and saved in an unencrypted xls file accessible on the public SMB 1.0 fileshares. OH. And ""domain users"" was a member of ""domain admins"".
* The servers I listed above did not include the \~20 server 2003 instances that we shut down.
* The servers I listed above did not include the \~40 other VMs that did seemingly nothing. The conclusion we reached there was ""he built a VM for every task, and if he messed it up along the way, he just built another one and left the originals running"".
* Windows, office, and adobe licensing was all done through the cheapest routes possible (e.g. third party chinese websites). These license keys were stored in word docs alongside the installers, typically on the desktop of a user's sign-in on a workstation. About a week after I started, those licenses started expiring. The business owner was not happy to hear that he'd have to buy more licenses.
* We were told about 2 domains. Turns out there were \~15 - most just weren't actively used.
* Several of those other domains operated on servers that ran DHCP on the same VLAN as everything else. To get around this, he simply set every users' workstation to have a static IP with static DNS. Oh, and the ISP ran DHCP at those other sites too...
* After consolidating data, they ended up having \~10TB of unique data. Before this, there was a grand total of a little over 100TB living across the various servers. Apparently, in years past, he would drive between sites with a hard drive to update files between sites.
* Since the ISP managed the switches, they basically just handed off trunk ports to them. Some of the ports on the switches were configured as access to VLANs designated for other businesses - at one point a users' workstation got a weird IP after they moved it. Turns out he could see the neighboring business's computers. Later network scans I ran indicated that there were devices (including printers) not on-premise which could be seen. They vanished after we replaced the switches.
* The domain admin password was the name of the business, in all lowercase, followed by the year of its founding.
* Drive mappings were all done manually, often by IP. Users didn't know how to do this; he would do it in person when driving onsite.
* Cable runs in each building were from the switches to the workstations (male to male). No wall jacks or patch panels. Many unused cables were crimped as rollover or crossover.
* Several server racks weren't actually secured to anything. Found that out the hard way when pushing a cable into a switch port almost knocked the whole fucking thing over.
* The battery backups for the servers were all long dead. He somehow got them to not beep and not turn themselves off by doing some solder work within them.
* There were something like 20 other (undocumented) applications that specific users only had to use once every like...2 years or so, and we only learned of those over time. Sometimes it'd be a user saying that the workstation they pulled out of a basement cabinet drawer wouldn't boot, and it'd be a windows 95 machine running software that could only be found on floppy disks dug out of file cabinets. Other times it'd be something that used to run on servers that he'd boot up only when the users needed it - some of those he literally kept at his house.

I was put in charge of figuring out and fixing all of it. Mind you, I was new to windows domain environments, so this amounted to taking pretty much the worst example of a network possible, reverse engineering it, reducing that picture down to what it *needed* to do, and improving it to modern standards - ones that I hadn't even learned yet. I was not allowed to impose downtime, even after hours.

Finally, just as icing on the cake, I was also basically the main person supporting them, and across the entire company, there was only one user who could distinguish cable shapes by description, who left partway through the year. None of the users really knew what they needed on a day-to-day basis; they relied on the ""IT guy"" to do almost everything, whether it was plugging mice/keyboards in, changing the printer to print to (not the default printer; just the choice of it), or how to use the applications their job roles relied on. There wasn't a week I worked there where I didn't answer at least 2 calls from users asking how to do something in some app made just for their company. I gathered more information by periodically analyzing data pulled with Get-NetTCPConnection, Get-Process, and wireshark, than I did from talking to users. The only exceptions to this were those weird things that only got pulled out once every few years.

Towards the end of my time there, the guy actually came back into town, and provided us his extended notes. He wrote them while he was on the plane to Malaysia, but didn't think to send them over on any of the days where he got internet access. Those notes covered everything that I had already found out.

I worked in a support via email job and my favorite thing in the world was having an abusive customer raging about not being able to do something, using tons of inappropriate language, and just being an ass in general, when the reason they couldn't do X was that they are not an admin.  Then it was pure bliss to CC their boss on the thread with a message of...

&gt;This action requires administrative approval so I've gone ahead and CC'd (admin) onto this thread. Hi, (admin)! To catch you up I've included the previous thread discussing (employee's) request. Do we have your permission to go ahead with that?

2468,Story of a user who sat and waited for me for 2 hours,"So to preface this:

In my last role as a IT Engineer, I was the go-to person for everything. From Routine work, Installation and Upgrades to User support, I was the mug who was tasked with it.

I did report to an IT Manager, but he was always busy doing work for Sales/Operations/Finance so would rarely work with me unless I was doing a project. Onto the story!

So we have 3 other sites: 2 Planning/Work offices and 1 Servicing Yard. About 20+ people in each site at minimum. 

I get in at 9 to start my day. The plan is to start getting my furthest site ready for a Firewall Upgrade, as they are on a DrayTek and need moving to a Next Gen Firewall to help secure them. 

Instead I’m called on my mobile immediately by a Planning Manager (we’ll call him Mike), who’s been trying to get a hold of me for the past hour.

Me: Hey Mike what’s up?

Mike: Hey Yucchie, can you give Emily (one of the work planners who has a reputation for not being so bright, and always asking us at IT for support) a call please? She says she can’t use her laptop and she’s been unable to work for about 2 hours now

Me: Yeah sure thing, I’ll give her a bell and see what’s up

My manager turns to me and says “Yucchie! I forgot to tell you. Emily needs a hand with her laptop and hasn’t been able to work for 2 hours now”

Me: Yeah, Mike just gave me a bell. I’ll get a hold of her and see what’s up

So I call Emily, and the whole time I’m thinking of what could’ve happened to her machine. I was worried that her SSD was corrupted; as during that week, we had a string of machines all BSOD due to an SSD corruption

I get through to her:

Me: Hey Emily, it’s Yucchie. What’s up with your machine?

Emily: I don’t know. I can’t do my work!

(Nice. Real descriptive, love)

Me: Can you open any programs or anything at all?

Emily: I don’t know. I can’t do anything!

Me: Ok, let me see what’s going on your machine

So I remote onto her machine and see that it’s just on her desktop. I can’t launch any applications. She right b. She can’t do anything. Odd.

Let’s reboot it to see if it works… And would you look at that. Just like magic. 

You telling me this bi-atch decided to wait for 2 hours without doing anything?! And people let her?!

Oh well, I have more important things to do instead of stressing over a users machine. So I decide to tell her how to at least be a smidge proactive, in case it happens again

Me: So what we just did was restart the-
Emily: I’m not listening to this *hangs up*

She then Messages me on Teams, ranting about how “my kind” are always talking in a condescending manner or always talking in a “gangster” way and how she’s not going to put up with my laid-back attitude that I have with people in the office whenever I visit. 

Huuuuuh?! Wtf? I’m not the idiot who decided to sit about and moan for 2 hours instead of trying to do SOMETHING. ANYTHING. Now I’m pissed. 

So I tell her how fucking stupid she must be to be sitting around for 2 hours and not ONCE think about rebooting her machine. 

Yes, I do have a laid back attitude, so that people feel more comfortable with asking me for help, as the last engineer used to just tell them to live with their problems (“it can’t be fixed. You’ll just have to use it like that!”) and never gave a shit about them. 

I just bluntly messaged her that if she needed any more help next time, she’d need to go to her manager and have him call with her machine physically next to him, as I won’t deal with her directly going forward.

Just like Emily, I also don’t have to listen to “this”.

I never did get any more requests or issues with her machine after that point. How odd.

2470,Ice Bucket and Fan Verses Hottest Recorded Day in the State.,"TL:DR - Hottest Recorded day in my State, AC Fails in School's server room. I use ice buckets and an industrial fan to save Server Room.

&amp;#x200B;

2012 Sophomore year of high school we got a new IT Technician who had enough certs to be legally allowed to teach classes as electives (Net+ and SEC+ I believe he has CASP but I don't remember if he had it before or after I started the year). I decided to take an elective with him as a SYSOP, that's what we called that class/elective/title thingy. 

Up to starting the year my only IT experience is my fixing my Gaming PC and once kicking a printer in 4th grade and fixing it (Probably how I knew I was destined to be in IT) That year my state had record temperatures in August/September right when school started. I was probably about 2-3 weeks into school at the time of this incident so I had learned the basic stuff such as reset passwords, printers, reimage. One day a few weeks into the school year the IT dude had to head out for the day for an Appt and he said as he left I'm in charge of everything for the day and said make sure you keep an eye on the Server room due to the heat. ( Turns out it was and still is the hottest recorded day in our state)

I wasn't a problem child or anything during school and with my new status as the ""Assistant Sysop"" I kinda had free range to go in and out of class to assist with various issues throughout the day, especially when your IT dude was our or busy at the other school. So that day I would step out of class every hour or so and make sure the server room was good. 

About 1pm I go to check the server room and the AC cut out and temperatures were exceeding over 100F at this point.  I started to freak out because I can't fix the AC myself and if it got any hotter I knew the servers would shut down and that would be a big no no. The School was still running Novel and just really old and outdated hardware and I'm sure if It was shut off and restarted unintentionally it probably wouldn't start up again type of old. 

After brainstorming on what I should do I got the biggest stroke of genius I ever received, probably cashed out for a few years). I propped open the door got one of the ridiculously big industrial fans and pointed to blow air into the server room.

My high school had a large Ice maker in the hallway, I really don't know why we had it to this day because where I'm from its normally not that hot, even during the summer, and its literally just sitting in a hallway not even near the cafeteria.

I went and found some of the biggest buckets I could find I filled them up with ice and placed it in front and behind the Fan. It ended up bringing the Temps from around 120F down to about 65-70 as long as I kept adding ice as it melted. 

For sure I saved the Server's from either shutting off and or completely failing. Kinda proud of it.",1,1626349636
2471,First Week Deployed. RIP UPS,"Sort of a short story.

My first Deployment (Army) started about 2 months ago.
The Unit we just replaced left after the first week. That next Monday morning I was by myself in the office trying to figure out how everything is laid out. The Switches/Router/VPN box is all behind a locked Cage. 

The cage is centered along a wall of the room so you can walk across the front of it and on the sides. If that makes sense. 

The old unit stuffed a bunch of White boards in one of the corners and I decided to grab one because they are useful for tracking tickets, general information and what not. I pulled one out after fighting with it for a few seconds nothing thinking about why it was so hard and walked back into my office. Within legit seconds I had everyone storming my office saying the Phones and internet is out. 

Me being the only in the office started sighed and started verifying that the internet is actually out. Turns out the old unit ran the power cable from the UPS to the power outlet outside of the cage and ran it through the legs of the Smart Board (It's one of those ones that stands up and the legs are connected at the bottom. 

Turns out I shut everything off and we found our our UPS was dead 🙃. 

Sorry for the probable bad grammar and what not. I only had a few mins to write this.

Check the health of your UPS!",1,1626337550

That kind of amuses me a bit since I bought my first 27"" in 2008 and really consider it standard by many years. But it also reminds me of this story.

2005-2010 I was freelancing next to my study for a newly founded (I was kinda involved in founding, actually) IT service company. Our main first customer was this student administration responsible for 8 or so university campuses with their canteens and the dormitories. For the German speaking people here: a ""Studentenwerk"".

If you have ever worked with customers from public administration, you know they are a special kind of user. Example: ""We, the united public administration workforce, resist upgrading from Office 2003 to Office 2010 because we require a proper training first."" Yeah.... or you'll just figure it out.

Anyway. We managed to sell them a whole lot of new flat screen displays, 100 or so plus installation service. Nice business for us. Back in the days, must be like 2008, those meant 24"" WQHD Dell for them. Nice. But they were coming from 14"", 15"" or maybe even 17"" displays. Most of them definitely from max 15"". What resolution did they use then? 1024x768 probably. 

After installing all those displays in a weekend session the week was starting with quite a number of complaints about the new displays. Were they not working? Oh yes, they were. But all the text is just too small. 

Admittedly, there were many older people working there. We tried to explain the zooming feature of browsers, Office etc, and many users adapted with it. But three users of one particular office were resisting acceptance. Regardless what we did, they could not be satisfied.

So what did we end up doing? We paid them a visit, set their resolution to something like 1280 x 800, hit ""apply"", hit accept, closed our eyes and started backing out of their office, not daring to look at what we have just done.

Feedback: Perfect, thank you. Ticket closed.

2477,"""It just started randomly doing this on its own"".","Long time lurker, first time poster. I have worked in tech for over half a decade and finally feel like I have a story with enough substance to post.

One of the first tech debacles I ran into this week: 

I get a computer to wipe clean of any company information from a user in one of my offices. Before I got it in my hands, he sent me a picture of the display that had a black screen with a lock on it. The laptop would not load to the OS past this. He said he didn't do anything and that randomly started several times throughout our interactions. Fast forward and we find out it is a BIOS/Hard Drive lock. He manages to guess the password after several attempts and reboots. As the laptop loaded in, his earlier message popped into my head: ""It just started randomly doing this on its own"". I get off the phone with him and continue on. I reboot and get past the lock to go into the BIOS and disable the feature, another lock shows up, this time with a computer icon instead of the hard drive icon. I approach it with confidence and enter the first password and it fails. I give the user a call back and after another grueling game of ""Guess, Guess, Guess, Reboot"", we get in. 

&gt;""It just started randomly doing this on its own"". 

This time though, I wrote down all of his guess... ""just in case"", I thought to myself. . I am, finally, in the BIOS and tell him, ""Ok I will look into turning this off and let you know if I have any other issues."" I find the steps to turn off the Hard drive/BIOS lock and am greeted with a screen informing me that I will need the ""Supervisor Password"" to disable the lock. I plug in the first password. Failed. I plug in the second password. Failed. There was a THIRD PASSWORD set on this computer.

&gt;""It just started randomly doing this on its own"". 

Before calling the user back, I go through the list of passwords that I jotted down from our previous and, low and behold, it was one of those. After plugging in this THIRD PASSWORD, that he definitely didn't put on his computer, I reboot and the computer loads to the BIOS and OS fine. I am finally in the home stretch but not before noticing something that most definitely was not done by the user. The laptop had also been removed from our company domain. I am not sure what end he was trying to reach but he probably didn't get there.

&gt;""It just started randomly doing this on its own"". 

 To recap:
- There was a hard drive lock setup
- There was a different BIOS password setup
- There was a different Supervisor password setup
- And the computer was removed from the domain

&gt;""It just started randomly doing this on its own""

At the end of the day, I got the computer wiped and sent back to him but it was one hell of a journey.

TLDR: User needs his company computer wiped but it magically developed several hurtles that prevented me from doing so. All on its own.",1,1626291328
2478,Tales of an annoying employee part 3,"In my previous posts in this series, people were commenting about how we should have went to the user's manager. Hang on, that will be in the next part but for now, enjoy the continued saga about the biggest pain in the ass I have ever dealt with. If anyone can come up with a better name for this series, I'd love to hear it. It will likely be about 6 or 7 parts.

So, about a month has passed since the last part. We havent heard anything from the user since my boss put him in his place. Life has been good. Until I refreshed my help desk and theres a ticket from... the user's boss! *gasp* I know, his boss is putting in a ticket for him? Well, let's dive into this ticket. 

UB: Hello, User has sent me an email to let me know that hes having some lag issues. He said you have already spoken to him but dismissed his issues. I am also having an issue using VNC to view his screen so I cant really help him with questions. Can you please give him a call and help him out? 

My Boss: oh, what the hell. We already told him there isnt a problem. HangmanMatt, can you call him and see what the problem is? 

Me: *sigh and calls user* Hello User, your boss put in a ticket for you. What seems to be the problem? 

User: The same problem as before. I cant work and that's cutting into my pay. Ive been running speed tests every day and the speed on your vpn is too slow. You need to upgrade it. When I'm off the vpn, I get 300 mbps download and 30 upload. I pay for the top internet plan in my area so it's not on my end. Also, my boss cant view my screen now so he has to help me with screenshots via email. 

Me: ok, one problem at a time, what are the speeds on the vpn? 

User: 50 down and 10 up. I have just started transferring documents to my home computer just so I can do my job and that takes a long time too. 

Me: ok, that's more than sufficient. We have over 100 other users working in the same manner you are. Some are on the west coast, none of them are having the lag issues you are describing. Second, you shouldn't be download documents to your home computer. They contain confidential customer information that needs to stay within our network. Third, you cant do your job from your home computer because our system can only be accessed internally, that's why you remote into a computer that's here on the east coast. 

User: well then fix my lag issue and I wont have to do that. 

Me: fine, walk me through your home network. Are you in wifi? 

User: No 

Me: ok... where is your router. 

User: in my basement 

Me: ok... so you have a cable running up through the floor to your office? 

User: no, my router connects to a 16 port switch that my friend who is a city network engineer gave me. Then those cables run throughout my house to the various rooms. I then have a router that goes to a switch on my desk for my desktop, my printer, and the computer you guys gave me. 

Me: I'm sorry, you have two switches? Do you have two independent ISP connections at your house? 

User: no, just the one. My router in my basement goes to the 16 port switch which goes to my office to my second router, which then goes to my 5 port switch, which goes to my computers. 

Me: who the hell told you to set your home network up like that? That switch is likely an old managed switch that the programming was never cleared out of which you're then running to a second router. Remove the managed switch and the second router and most of your lag should stop. 

User: No, you're wrong, I've had this set up for about 6 months and trying to work for you is the only issues I'm having. I took a networking class and was only a couple classes from getting my degree. I just didnt finish. I know what I'm talking about. 

Me: ok, well, I'm telling you now, that's your problem but since you dont want to remove it, live with your lag. Now, other problem. I'm gonna check your display settings to see if that's causing VNC to fail. *checks display settings* why is your scaling settings changed to 150%? that's what's causing VNC to fail. 

User: dont change the scaling settings, I cant see the screen properly if you change it back. 

Me: you know you can just zoom everything in right? 

User: no, I cant. It's still hard to see if I zoom. I need to use the scaling. 

Me: fine, so you understand your manager cant help you. 

User: I guess. I just wish you knew how to do your job so you could fix me but I guess I'll endure. 

At this point, I'm already done with this guy. I hang up the phone and had to take a walk. After a couple minutes, I return to my desk and update the ticket with everything I did, everything we discussed, and the users refusal to listen. Bare in mind, the user's manager put the ticket in so he saw my reply. 

UB: Why couldnt you get the issues fixed? 

Me: I'm sorry but he refuses to listen when I tell him what the problem is. He thinks he knows more than us and I cant help him. Maybe you can talk to him but he wont listen to us. 

UB: ok, I'll talk to him. 

Great now we might get somewhere... stay tuned for part 4.",1,1626288206

2480,Rookie mistake,"I currently work in the IT field and am on my 7th year, but have a career background in tech of 11 years total. The 4 years of tech experience was Pro AV installation (speakers, amps, audio/video racks, etc.)  At my current IT job, it's just the 2 of us: me and my boss. My boss is incredible at his job, but with my experience, he primarily works in the box now. I handle most of the hardware troubleshooting, maintenance, weekend admin work, and all things involving AV.

Everyone here has incredibly entertaining stories about trying to help the end user, but this time I want to do it different and share a rookie mistake I made personally. 

A couple years ago at my current IT job, my boss and I showed up early to tidy up the network racks in the server room.  We were unplugging power cables and re-routing them, dressing the network cables, moving and re-mounting servers and switches, you already know. 

We worked at it for about an hour and were about 15 minutes until we open our doors and already had employees showing up. Our firewall needed mounted and it was a heavy boy. We worked quickly, scrambling to hold it in place and screw in the rack screws; he was in the front of the server, I was behind it, we both had screwdrivers. We were quickly locking this down just to get the pressure off our arms and one of my screws decides to cross thread. I forget it, and move to the next. Boom, boom, boom 1, 2, and 3 are screwed in but I want the 4th one in. 

I focus all my effort on that one. I unscrew it and proceed to thread it back. It felt it thread straight and solid, but I was getting a lot of resistance. I feel around but touch nothing that seems out of place. Time was ticking and we were down to about 5 minutes. I decided to give it 100% ""full cowling"" and torque this rack screw in place. I hit the breakover point in the rack and then ""the oh no"" happened...

POP POP POP! Sparks and smoke quickly fill the air and I'm just going ""shit shit shit shit shit shit!"" My boss on the other side is going ""what what what? We're losing everything what happened!"" 

He runs around back, and says ""focus and fix this, I'll go fix the power. We have 5 minutes!"" 

So I quickly cut power despite there being none, and unscrew the rack screw. I fish around for a bit and find the fucker that I missed before...a power cable had gotten pinched between the firewall rack ears and the rack rails. I quickly fish it out and run a new one, get the firewall screwed back in and fire it up. Meanwhile, my boss is getting tons of calls from everyone about our network...we found the breaker and flipped it on. I flipped the power on our servers and our network started coming to life...

It felt like forever, but with network and power restored, everything still worked perfectly.  After all was fixed and we could breathe for a second, we examined the power cable. I hit it dead center and couldn't aim any better if I tried. My boss had a hell of a laugh from the ordeal at my expense and reminds me TO THIS DAY that he has seen some shit...but never anything like that lol! 

This was probably 3 years ago now and I still hear ""don't go putting screws in power cables,"" or ""don't take down the network this time."" Just a friendly reminder to check twice, and if it doesn't go in easy, don't force it! 

I always tell people, ""no fuck-upsies"" but I never take my own advice...",1,1626276824
2481,Sweating bullets,"So this is a short story about my first days as syadmin for a SME.  


I got my job, many years ago, hired from the inside purely on the merit of taking some 3D Animation/modeling classes in college, so let's just say I was diving head-first into something I knew nothing of besides maybe swapping out a NIC on an old Gateway computer when I was 13, and having a vague understanding of what an IP address was.  


In my first week I shadowed my co-worker and tried to learn as much as I could, asking questions as I went. I wrote everything down on a pad I'd keep in my back pocket.  


In my second week, my coworker left for a year, and my boss went on vacation for a week. I was there, by myself, with no real I.T. experience.  


I get a call, from the boss of all the bosses of my organization. He tells me he needs help and to come to his office. I'm immediately freaking out internally.  


So I grab my notepad and my pen, take a deep breathe and proceed down the hall towards his office. At this point I'm replaying everything I've learned so far in my head, and thinking ""this is it, he's going to think I'm an imbecile and today is my last day""  


When I get to his office, he's visibly upset and frustrated that someone has sent him some documents, but he doesn't know how to open them. Confused a bit on the matter I ask him to show me. He points to a CD/DVD disk on his desk. Reluctantly, I pick the disk up, open his disk tray on his machine, place the disk in, and close the tray. Immediately Windows prompts him with File Explorer and he sees the pdf's. Joy washes over his face. ""What did you do!?"" he asks. I reply by explaining that you can put CD's in the computer \*here\* (pointing to the disk tray) and that let's you see what's on them.  


I walked out of there feeling like I might just be cut out for this job.

Context: This user started working for us around the end of 2018. He lived in the midwest in a major city. He would be connecting via vpn tunnel to our office on the east coast, then using remote desktop to get to a physical machine in our back room set up for him and only him. All our remote employees were using a similar setup. He was one of the first people we issued a work from home computer set up with windows 10. We still were trying to figure out the bugs, quirks, lockdown commands, group policy, etc. We really dragged our feet on the move from windows 7. When we issued work from home computers, they were locked down to where you couldnt even open calculator. This being windows 10 however, we hadn't figured out the proper ways of locking it down so the early win10 WFH pcs were almost out of the box. Our vpn was an OpenVPN setup running off two servers on two different internet runs from two different companies. This meant if one ISP went down for any reason, we still had internet and a VPN server that everyone could fall onto and keep working.

When the user started, we expected some complaints or issues and we would work through them together. Windows 10 was new for us too. This user however was going to be the bane of my existence for the next two years. This is the story of the first of many issues, unrelated to windows 10.

The ticket arrived from user: Hello, I'm experiencing some lag issues, can you guys help?

Me: sure, what kind of lag do you mean, input lag (typing and then the characters showing up a second or two later) or general slowness (clicking on a link and just getting a loading circle)?

User: Both.

Me: okay... let me connect in to see what's going on.

I proceed to connect in via TeamViewer and see that the issues hes describing are so minor, it's like half a second input delay and the wait after clicking a link is maybe a second or two. Standard for a general office computer and the slight input lag is to be expected when using a VPN tunnel over 1500 miles. It's not going to be instant but close enough to work effectively. I explain this to the user, he understands, ticket closed. Simple.

Two days later...

User: I'm experiencing lag issues, I spoke with HangmanMatt a couple days ago and he failed to fix them. Can someone else please help me?

My Boss then looks over her desk: HangmanMatt, why is the user saying you didnt help him?

Me: Read the ticket from yesterday, #1234.

My Boss: Call him and see what you can do.

Me: Nothing I can do but if you want me to remind him of what I told him before, then sure. *Calls user* Hello, this is HangmanMatt, I see you put in another ticket for the same issue. Has it gotten worse?

User: Oh, i asked to speak to someone else but yes, it's gotten worse. I cant work, this is so bad.

Me: ok... *connects via TV* please show me what you're talking about.

User: *starts working and demonstrates the same lag as before, minimal and perfectly adequate to do his job* See, it's so bad I cant work.

Me: I'm sorry but what you're showing me is nothing out of the ordinary. The input lag is minimal but to be expected, you're on a VPN tunnel, 1500 miles away, using remote desktop to connect to a computer here. It's not instant. The signal has to be transmitted from you, out here, the computer does what you are asking it to do, then the picture is transmitted back to you, 1500 miles away. The fact that you're experiencing this is normal and theres nothing we can do to fix it. Is there anything else I can help you with?

User: No... *click*

Me: ok, hang up on me, whatever. *closes ticket*

Maybe now it's the end of this. I mean seriously, it's not that hard to understand, is it? The rest of the week, nothing. Monday morning...

User: Hello, I'm still experiencing lag issue, I have spoken with HangmanMatt twice and would like to speak with someone else as he is refusing to fix my problem.

Bare in mind our IT department consists of three people total, me, our senior tech, and our boss. All three of us sit right next to each other and the two of them heard my second conversation with the user and are aware at this point that hes being a pain.

My Boss: ok senior tech, do you want to call the user or should I? HangmanMatt has dealt with him twice and theres no issue.

Senior tech: You do it, if hes as bad as HangmanMatt says, maybe the IT manager will shut him up.

My boss: Hello user, what seems to be the problem? Ok... let me connect to see the issue... ok, show me... I dont see an issue, you're on a VPN tunnel 1500 miles away... I am the IT manager for the company, how can I help you?... I'm sorry but theres no issue and therefore nothing we can do to fix it. At this point you have submitted three tickets about the same issue that cant be fixed... The only way to fix it would be for me to fly out there and run a 1500 mile cable directly from you to us so if you're willing to pay for that to happen then sure, I can fix it. Ok, have a nice day... Goodbye. *click* ok, that should be the last of that issue.

2483,"Fast, cheap, reliable – choose two.","Here’s a story from not that long ago: our CTO signed a contract with this company to deliver us some software-hardware solution for our wireless network along with upgrading all of the wireless hardware in the building. It was supposed to be a gradual process of interchanging APs and introducing new hardware as we go along. And so it was until one moment when someone from upper management got upset about techies being constantly on the floor for the second day in a row. He talked to the CTO and we were told to try and hurry up the process. If the fact that our operation had to take time in order to not disrupt anything wasn’t enough of a reason to give us that time, then the fact we were also dealing with new hardware and configuring it on the go had to be THE reason to give us time. Alas, no one really listened. Long story short, we tried our best to finish everything in one day by just blasting through the place without paying too much attention to detail. Next day we start getting drop-outs and problems at some people’s workplaces.

An interlude: Our staff uses company-provided laptops as their main machines (LG grams…don’t ask, they were chosen because they are light) because we have a mixed work schedule (three days in the office, two days at home), obviously not everyone’s at work at the same time but it still creates a precedent for a very sensitive wireless environment. We can’t let it be interrupted. I long since talked to management about buying laptops with dedicated LAN ports to not bother people with type-C dongles but it lead nowhere. 

Okay, back to the business at hand: well, what do I know, we misconfigured several APs while trying to just go fast. Turns out we used wrong configuration on several APs. It was a more strict config for some departments that don’t have access to certain parts of our internal network. Guys just went from one department to the next without checking. 

In the end we still were the ones to blame for not doing our job properly, who would have thought! The whole thing turned out to be not so fast, not so reliable and absolutely not cheap. It’s a bit of a clusterfuck this place.

2484,mitel phone system glitch gives me a chuckle,"we got a mitel phone system mid last year, and it's caused no end of problems. most of them are tearyourhairout frustrating, but this one wasn't so bad.

for some reason the system decides to assign my name to phone calls, even when i'm not involved. it has led to lots of confusion as the user picks up expecting to speak to me and it's not me. 

there were two recent instances of this with the finance director and accounts manager, both of which i'm on good terms with. the accounts manager answered with 'yo' and the finance director answered with 'whaddya want, phoenix?', only to find they were talking to the senior partner. 

they both asked why this was happening, and all i could say was 'mitel is shit'. their main complaint though was that they didn't want to speak to the senior partner and only answered cos they thought it was me!",1,1626251078
2485,Everything from nothing to nothing,"**TLDR:** Nobody provides my with any information about an external e-mail account for a mobile device and in the end, nothing is resolved.

So its vacation time in my country and my colleague decided to send me one of their unresolved ticket before they go on vacation.

I say ""Ticket"", but what I really mean is that they **forward** an email chain with their message was ""can you fix this on Monday? lemme know if you need anything.""

So immediately there are **several** things that annoy me. 

1. Its a FW conversation. I need to go through the whole conversation to get an idea of what the request is and there is no ticket so I have no history, no notes. Nothing.

2. Its a user who is leaving the company, why are we giving this user any form of any support at all?

3. They need help with setting up an e-mail account on their mobile, that's it. And this is something we expect 90% of all employees to do on their own. 

4. Colleague is going on vacation gave me NO backstory and is basically asking me to do all the legwork they should've done prior to forwarding it.

But hey, I'm a good sport. Also we get these kind of lazy requests all the time. E-mails that say ""HELP URGENT!"" and nothing else, y'all know the routine.

So anyway, Monday comes and I talk to the user and explain I am leaving a bit earlier that day since I've take the early shift. ""OK he says, I'll swing by before then."" 

Immediately, all my alarms go off. This guy is gonna swing by last minute and fuck up my afternoon isn't he... Yup.... Again, I swallow my pride and try to help the user. 

And as a cherry on top, turns out, its an external e-mail. So not only am I helping a former employee with the most basic task for a mobile device with no information, they also need help with something completely unrelated to our systems. 

Again, putting on my best support smile and ask some routine questions.

**Me:** ""Is it an outlook e-mail, a gmail or yahoo? What kind of e-mail account is it?""

**User:** Don't know.

**Me**: \*screams internally\* ""I see. Well what information can you provide? Wee need some specifics to add the account you see.""

**User:** I have the e-mail address, my daughter help set it up.

**Me**: OK great, maybe she has some additional information provided. Can you show me your correspondence about the e-mail?

**User:** \*Shows me.\*

Basically its an e-mail domain purchased by some third-party vendor I've never heard of and the user account that made the purchase but no account information for the current user so completely unrelated.

**Me:** Huh, I see. Well just give me a minute. \*Goes to the vendor, find their settings for IMAP/e-mail and add everything, all that's left is username and password.\* Ok that should do it! What is your password to the e-mail?

**User:** Do I need it?

I am not sure how long I stared at them but I had this sensation of sinking for what felt like a five minutes of silence, probably just a few seconds thou.... I hope.

**Me:** Yes, you will need the password for the e-mail to log in to the mailbox.

**User:** Could it be X?

**Me:** I am sorry but there is no way for us to know.... But you could maybe try and access it in a web GUI? How do you access the mailbox from your PC?

**User:** I can access it from my PC?

**Me:** Have you ever logged into the email? 

**User:** I think so. (WHAT DO YOU MEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAN?)

**Me (Finally losing my patience):** Look, All you need to do when you get home is enter the correct password in here \*shows them\*. Unfortunately that's the best I can do.

**User:** Ok, thank you

**Me: \***Leaves, having achieved basically nothing that has anything to do with my job description\*

So in summary: I had no information about anything, trying to help a user who no longer works a my company  with a completely external problem where I have zero tools to help them. And the user had no information to help themselves either so in the end my time was wasted and nothing was resolved.",1,1626249556

2489,Wakey Wakey!! Never give out your personal number!!,"This [story](https://www.reddit.com/r/IDontWorkHereLady/comments/ojcbsj/a_former_client_refused_to_accept_that_i_was_no/?sort=top) about early morning calls made me remember something that happened to me almost 15 years ago.

At that time I had become our team's expert on a specific product. If first contact couldn't figure it out it got routed to me. By chance there was a fairly large client that had constant problems with this product. At one point I was on the phone with them multiple times per day for weeks. I would come in and the first thing I would do is call them in response to an email or voicemail from them. That's how I started my day for a while.

I dealt almost exclusively with two people, both of whom lived and worked on the East coast, where their company was based. I lived and worked on the west coast, although my company had general support staff on both coasts. But since I was the designated expert for this one product and was constantly on the phone with them about it, I became ""their"" contact by default. 

I quickly found that their issues were almost entirely self-inflicted errors due to both men not understanding basic principles. So they kept making the same mistakes, trying to correct them, then making more mistakes. Both guys were well meaning however and sincerely trying to do better. I eventually nicknamed the two guys ""Tommy John,"" a play on their first names. They found it amusing since they were both big baseball fans. I would kid one of them about his giant moustache, which he did not have, making him a spitting image of the real Tommy John, who also did not have a giant moustache. In other news my lack of an eye patch makes me a spitting image for Brad Pitt.

One day I was in the middle of a fire drill with both halves of Tommy John. It was some kind of emergency where they had a meeting with auditors in a couple hours. Both of them were panicking about not getting this done, facing some sort of penalty, their boss would explode, etc.

Then we had a power outage. The generator did not immediately come online so briefly we lost phones and our network connections. At that point I knew Tommy's number by heart, so I called him back on my personal cell, breaking a rule of mine and a rule of my company, but he was a nice guy and he did need help. I talked them through what to do. I confirmed that I had called him on my personal cell and asked him not to call that number. Please go through the regular number to reach me. Both halves of Tommy John swore they would NOT call my personal cell.

The next month they called my personal cell. They hadn't been able to reach me yet that day and needed help with another emergency. It was close to their end of day (early afternoon my time) and they needed to fix something before they submitted the result. I said I understood this was a one-time exception and helped them out. They swore they would never call that number again.

Two months later they called again. This was another emergency, and they again promised to never call again. And this time they never did. They had gradually improved and were now almost competent. Thereafter I moved on to other things.

Two years later I got a phone call about 6:30 AM waking me up. It was from someone who had taken over for both halves of Tommy John. He was having an issue with product I used to support and asked me to help. I explained that I used to support that product but didn't anymore, and suggested that he call the help desk. He said that he had and was promised a call back. It had been *almost an hour* and he had NOT gotten a call back. He found my personal cell number in the contact sheet for my company with a note next to it that it was to be used ONLY for emergencies. Well, he had one.

I offered some vague general troubleshooting and asked that he wait a little longer for the resource that currently does support the product. Unfortunately for me, I still knew enough to recognize the likely problem and my basic advice fixed his issue. 

From that point forward he began calling called me whenever he wanted help, always between 5-7 AM my time.  After the first few mornings of this I put my cell phone on silent until I got to the office. Then I would pass on to the person who took over my role that he had called and please call him back. She would roll her eyes and said she'd get to it as soon as she could. He would sometimes call again if she didn't call back quick enough to his liking. Occasionally he'd catch me when I wasn't on the phone and I just answered out of habit. I would always get an earful.

This experience taught me three things.

First, never break the rule of giving out out your personal contact information.

Second, setting your cell phone to silent while you're asleep is fantastic. My parents also lived on the east coast. As my mother got older she started to occasionally call me early in the morning since she forgot about the time difference. Once she called at 5 AM because she needed to know my hat size. This solved that problem too.

Third, East coast bias is intractable. In my current position I attend 6 AM meetings a few days a week. But god help me if I book a meeting past 1 PM my time.",1,1626205269

This is not how I am normally I'm calm and I'm very articulate about what I need and I did myself really off day for me.

As of writing this post I figured out the problem got the problem fixed it was a problem on my end not there and and I called customer service again and talk to a really lovely gentleman will call him T and I apologized because I was in the wrong and I think it's important that whenever you realize you do something wrong that you apologize.

2492,COVIDiot vs WiFi,"This is a shortish one, mainly because I think I blacked out from the sheer stupidity.

C = Customer, M = Me.

C: “My WiFi keeps dropping out”

M: “I’m sorry to hear that. Let’s see if we can figure out what the cause is”

20mins of troubleshooting later, the line is fault free, router is running correctly, set up and positioning is correct and I’m drawing a blank on the cause. As a last-ditch, I boot up a mesh analysis tool.

M: “I’m seeing some signs of interference. It looks like there’s a device broadcasting quite a strong 5ghz signal on the same frequency as your router. It’s coming and going so likely a mobile device. Have you bought any new wireless electronic devices lately?”

C: “No but my neighbours have just had the vaccine”

M: “I don’t see what that has to do with anything”

C: “Obviously the 5G tracking chip in the shot is interfering with my WiFi!”

2493,Outlook isn't Working,"Ok, so this is my first post here and one of the few posts I've made on Reddit. Just wanted to share this story.

I get a ticket from a client stating that he cannot access his emails. He said he could access them last Thursday, but has not received any new emails since Thursday. I say ok, no issue, can I connect to your PC? He says sure. I ask him to open his ""web browser"". He says, ""What?"" To which I reply ""Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge, whichever you prefer."" He again asks ""What?"" I say, ""When you look something up on the internet, can I get you to go there?"" He says, ""I'm going to go get some help. I don't know what you're asking."" Internally I'm screaming PLEASEEEEEEE!!! He brings in a coworker and she is able to open a browser so I can connect to the PC. I remote in and am looking at his Outlook and it is asking for his password. I ask him to enter it, and he's like, ""A password? I don't know any password."" At this point, I'm debating how he is able to use his computer at all. I ask him, ""When you get into work in the morning, what password do you enter to log in?"" He's like, ""OHHHHH, (tells me his password)."" I enter what he told me, but it was invalid. I ask him, ""Are you sure that's the correct password?"" He says, ""Yes! I use it every day. (There's a pause.) Wait it said it expired last week and my coworker changed it to (new password)."" I enter that password and it authenticates him and loads his email. I am like, ""There you go sir, anything else I can help you with?"" He says, ""No. Thank you."" I hang up and just laugh.

2494,how much support do you need? the cost of nines,"At a previous job we had a fairly economical server infrastructure, many services running on older desktop machines with desktop type UPS units.  Critical services were mirrored, DNS and LDAP for example.  There was no line conditioning or fire suppression, not even sprinklers.  The one thing we actually spent money on was an enterprise grade file server.  When we purchased it the vendor offered several levels of support, 24X7, NBD,  and none.  We had upgraded from an older version of this unit and really liked the support offered, so we laid out the cost for the bosses.  The 24x7 was pretty pricey, NBD cheaper, but if something happened on a Friday afternoon, it would Monday before we could get support unless we paid extra, and weekend support was ""best effort"".    Everyone agreed loosing a weekend's worth of production could be lived with, we couldn't afford those extra ""nines"", so NBD was it.  

 This worked perfectly well for many months, but of course all good things come to an end.

I had been camping with my kids and was driving home on a Sunday.  My co worker calls me and says he's been trying to check his email and can't access the mail server.  He then tried accessing some other systems and can't reach anything in our server room, which also has our gateway network switch.  Co worker is feeling sick, can I go in and check?  I explain I can but I have to drop my kids off at home first, so it will be a couple of hours.  He decides he'll go in and check.   Calls me back me in about 45 minutes.  Server room A/C has completely failed, the door knob to the server room was actually hot to the touch, what should he do?    For weekends we contact the security folks, they can call in plumbers, or electricians, or the HVAC folks as required.  Mean time he shuts everything down and props the door open, puts a fan in the doorway.   I join him after I drop my kids off.  

HVAC guy is there, compressor on the A/C unit (we only have one for this room), will not turn on.  Its Sunday afternoon, the Lead HVAC guy will look at it on Monday.  In the mean time he brings over two portable units which we vent into the plenum, total jury rig but we get some cooling and are able to bring up a minimal number of services plus network switches.   We have no idea how hot the room got, our  ""economy grade"" server room is really biting us.

Monday we get the main A/C unit fixed, room is at normal temperature and we return all services to normal.  By some miracle, NONE of our servers has died.  But we are scared.  We don't know how long after end of business on Friday everything was stewing.   We figure out our fancy file server actually has a high/low temperature sensor that will tell us how hot the air input temperature got.  Its kind of tricky to get via a command line interface, but we find it.  Temp reached 140 degrees F.  Now we are really worried.   Schedule a meeting with the bosses, we are on borrowed time, stuff is going to start failing way sooner than we would have expected.  We are going to have to replace hardware, we should budget for an upgraded A/C unit, one with some redundancy.  We will implement temperature and power monitoring right away (all stuff that people said was ""too expensive"").  Bosses say they will think about it.  But everything is working now right?  So we have time, right?

Two weeks later our fancy file server fails.  On a Friday.   Completely.  This thing has multiple power supplies, two controller modules with fail-over, and of course, disks are redundant.  But the module that connects the two controller modules is a single point of failure, and it looks like its dead.  We are on the phone for hours with the vendor, they are very good but they simply do not believe the connection module is bad.  It never fails, they've never heard of it.   They are trying to locate a spare but we can't get it until Monday at the earliest.    We are flat down all weekend, no one can access their files, no email, our website is down.   

Monday we finally get the part in the afternoon and get it installed.  No data loss, so that good.   Big Boss calls us in, new project:  find out how much it will cost to upgrade the service to 24x7, find out how much to upgrade the A/C unit.  Come up with the plan to improve uptime across the board.  Suddenly all the stuff that was too expensive is now possible.   

What I really learned from the entire episode was that folks don't really know how much uptime they need, until they actually experience an extended outage.",1,1626200042

2496,Always follow your change request procedure,"I work for a company that supports a wide variety of products including self checkouts (SCO). A specific store wanted to make their SCOs cashless in order to make it less work for staff working in the cash office to balance the lanes, etc.

Normally in situations like that, we would expect the customer's help desk to follow their own established process for change request. It wasn't. The help desk skipped that step and sent a ticket to field service to make the change. Of course, that ticket gets assigned to me. Rather than outright cancelling the request and telling help desk to follow the proper procedure, I called the store manager directly. I explained to him that any changes to the function of SCOs including making it cashless would require change request to be submitted and approved by their IT department before we can implement the change. He acknowledged that explaination and I closed the ticket and that was the end of it...so I thought.

A few months later, a different technician inquired with me about an issue that was difficult for him. A store reported numerous issues with their SCOs not dispensing money correctly. I looked into it and noticed that it was the same store that had initially requested to convert all of their SCOs cashless. I did some digging around and got ahold of a manager in charge of change management for that company. He said that they did recieve a request from that store and it was denied.

Ok, let's go to the store and find out exactly what's happening. I spoke to the head cashier, he said that there was an incident where a specific SCO dispensed an extra $5 to the customer. During the investigation, they discovered that all SCOs were short on cash and there was no apparent explaination for it. 

I started troubleshooting on the SCO in question that dispensed too much cash and couldn't find anything wrong with it. Performed the same set of troubleshooting on other SCOs, also turned up nothing. Throughout the troubleshooting, I spoke to various staff members and they all mentioned the same issue where a customer got an extra $5. Weird.

At the end of my shift, I had to pack up and come back next day to continue working on the issue as well as do some preventative maintenance. I returned next day and spoke to a different supervisor, she too, the same thing about the extra $5 being dispensed.

Then it clicked.

Everyone's story is exactly the same. They got the SCO correct, how much the customer purchased, how much the customer paid, and how much the customer got back in change. Normally when troubleshooting issues like this, I would get a few variation of the story but in this case, the details was exactly the same. Almost like it was rehearsaled.

So I finished my troubleshooting and ultimately found nothing wrong. I went to the store manager to present my findings. He wasn't happy and stated that if their self checkouts are losing money and we're not able to find the source of the loss, he wants me to make it cashless.

I, again, reminded him that as per contract with his employer, we cannot make major changes without their prior approval. 

Store manager: *Well, I spoke to BrockN and he said you could!*

It just occurred to me that he doesn't realize that the person he spoke to months ago, is me. 

BrockN: *Well, no that's not correct...*

SM: *Yes it is! Quit lying and make it happen*

B: *Sir, allow me to explain. What I said was, we can make it happen, as long as we have your company's approval. I already spoke to them before coming here and they already told me that they denied your request.*

SM: *Wait, you're Brock?*

B: *Yes...*

SM: *And you won't do it?*

B: *Not without the prior approval*

At this point, the manager gave up. I closed the call as no fault found and made it billable at close to $250 per hour. With my 4 hours plus close to a week of work performed by other tech, the store didn't try pulling this stunt again.

I returned to the store sometime later for an unrelated issue, found that the store used black duct tape to cover up cash entry. Looks ghetto.",1,1626191694

2498,The Magical Fucking Self Expanding Excel Spread Sheet.,"So I should start by saying I'm currently in the Army and we use Outlook for Email. I think each Email is maxed at 23mb. Something like that.

This SFC (Sergeant First Class) walks into my office and says ""I'm trying to send this Excel Spread Sheet ,but its stuck in my outbox"". I can't say to much but its just a bunch of Finance stuffs for where we are at. 

I walk into his office thinking probably the internet is being stupid or he has to relog into Outlook. 

I check everything, and its all good. I take A look at the file ands its almost 200mb. Bro. What.  It's like a 30 tab spreadsheet. I told him this wont send through outlook and you will have to split down the tabs into several emails and then have the end user assemble it back together, or throw it on a CD and give it to recipient. He makes a big deal about the CD like it wont be possible and just wont happen. 

So I reassure him break it down, send it in several emails and call it A day. Giving him that suggestion I walk away letting him take care of it.

He walks back into my office about 1HR later and he says even after splitting it each spreadsheet is now about 230MB. What. I go to his office and sure enough each separated spreadsheet is now 230MB. Bigger then the original. I had him show me how he was separating it and sure enough he's doing it right. I proceed to try and figure out how the hell its just expanding, even after splitting the files. I'm going to assume it has something to do with the formulas used in the excel but I realllllllly don't know because I do my best to stay away from Excel. lmao. 

I spend about an hour and a half fucking around with this spreadsheet before telling him this isn't going to work and just throw the original on a CD and he's still protesting, even after I keep telling him that this isn't gunna work. 

(We have A website we can use to send larger files but it takes time for it to process and what not before the other user can grab it and his guy wanted this stuff done now)

Eventually I get him to throw it on a CD and the guy who was receiving this file is legit one story above us. Wasted my life on stupid shit is how I work on a day to day basis in the Army.

So much so that they had no local copy - instead every night they copied their working folder to a write-once live DVD then deleted all the files off their daytime disk and the boss took the dvd home. Next day, copy it all back on and repeat.

The problem is that to make a live filesystem work on a write-once DVD the DVD writer has to rewrite the table of contents after it writes the new files. Until the day it doesn't, they don't notice and nobody knows until they try to load the files back on the next day...

We were a rather new IT consulting company providing all the services for small and mid size companies up to being a mid-size MSP later on. Kind of a success story actually.

So I was talking to the customer about a new setup for the their single on-site server. It was a Dell server with a physically installed domain controller which also served as file server and print server IIRC. Backup was done on a tape which should get exchanged daily but was forgotten about every second day or so - the usual. I was consulting him to a new server machine and splitting up the functions a bit with virtualization, by which we could do the backup using snapshots stored on a NAS - something like that, we were still talking concepts. Of course, the customer figured out the newer setup would be more sophisticated resulting in more $$$.

He then got an idea about backups: ""Mr. FraaRaz, I have a RAID, don't I? It's mirrored, isn't it?""

Me: ""Yes, RAID 1, mirrored.""

Customer, speaking while moving in the direction of the server: ""So I can just take out one drive and put it somewhere safe like taking it home."" Note: Server was just behind the next door - small companies... 

While I was still thinking of a reply, I heard a beep beep beep beep beep beep beep from the server. Customer returned smiling with a hard drive in his hand. I don't know what face I made in that moment but it sure wasn't pleased.  I tried pinging the server - nada. 

Took us an emergency act up into the night to rebuild the RAID properly. Actually I don't know exactly why it crashed so hard, since in theory the customer was right. Of course the idea was still a bad one.",1,1626075026
2503,"Every time power goes out, user gets disconnected from VPN unexpectedly","User called and says: i keep getting disconnected from VPN when i lose power. My power at my apartment keeps going out. My power is on now and im connected.

Me: (confuesed) Okay. So whats the issue? 

User: Its wierd. So every time my power to my apartment goes out, i get disconnected from VPN. But its working fine now.

Me: (still not fully understanding the issue) because the power keeps going out, the router keeps going down.

User: i didnt think i needed wifi. I was told that i would be able to connect to work from anywhere in the world using VPN.

Me: (finally understanding the issue. this mans lack of knowledge) Ah well as long as you are connected to wifi. You can connect from anywhere in the world meaning - if youre traveling, you can connect to work using VPN from a hotel, airport, starbucks, etc. but you still need a widi connection.

User: Okay. (Hangs up)

I thought being connected to a network was just common sense at this point, espcially for work (using applications/websites user’s familiar with by now)

Sorry if its lame, but these convos kinda amuse me. I always seem overestimate peoples knowledge.",1,1626001324

2506,Large bag of water causes internet outage,"At my previous job I worked for a university as a network engineer. It is a large campus with lots of agriculture. Because of some of the distances between buildings and the nature of the ""farm"" on the south side of campus, fiber was not run everywhere. 

This is a story of one such building that was provided with a point to point wireless link. The shot was just over a mile in distance. Everything worked as expected and really only had issues on rainy days. 

1 bright sunny day we get a ticket, Internet is out at farm building. We go out there, everything looks fine. We leave. Few days later, same thing. Ok, odd. A couple of weeks later we get the same report. We think maybe foliage from a nearby tree is causing issues, it was spring time and the link was installed during winter. Trim the trees. Still getting reports of outages.we realign the APs...doesn't help. What gives??

One day in late summer some coworkers are out there and noticed a very large bull laying on top of a hill. The same hill that the wireless link shoots over. LIGHTBULB!! They ask about the bull and are told that is his favorite place to lay down. *face palm* they raised the APs higher in the air and the problem went away. Haha a dang cow was blocking the wireless signal!!

TLDR; Wireless link between 2 buildings kept getting blocked by a bull laying on a hill.",1,1625888847
2507,I'm on vacation. Hold my emails.,"This is my first time posting here, but this call just baffled me and I have to share.

I work tech support for a company that basically services sales people and that's it. A lot of these sales people are a little older and don't really have good computer literacy.

So, it was my last call of the day. I say my cheerful greeting to the man on the other line and he tells me that he wants to not be bothered by emails on his phone while he's on vacation. Cool, I think, he wants me to turn off notifications so he doesn't get constantly told he has emails waiting. I confirm this with him and proceed to tell him how to go on do not disturb for the email system we have been told to move everyone to. He says that the steps don't make sense and that the options I'm having him look for don't exist. 

It takes five minutes and a request for ""someone who knows better"" to find out he is using the system we moved away from. I tell him he should move to the new system and helped him turn off notifications. He asks for a test email. Cool. I get it. I send the email and he gets it.

This was not what he wanted.

What he actually wanted was for me to turn off the email account for him. archangelsbrain.exe has stopped working. I said this was not possible for such a short period of time as a vacation. He weakly accepts the answer and hangs up.",1,1625886259
2508,Users are removing hard drives while the computer is on,"So, a little back story.  We have computers with removable hard drives.  You can literally push a button on the front of the tower and pull the hard drive out.  This is because the users have to lock up those drives at the end of the day.  

Apparently, some users are convinced that they are supposed to leave the system on, and with it powered up and the OS still running, eject the drive and lock it up for the day.  

And it gets better.  They will then leave the system powered up, or of they actually shut the system down before ejecting said drive power the computer up sans hard drive.  This is so it can get updates over the night.  You know, the ones that are patches and software pushes for the computer.  Which at this point doesn't have a hard drive.  So it'll just sit there all night with ""No Boot Device Found"", supposedly getting updates.  I'm not making this up.",1,1625880775
2509,"fuses are great, but","Kind of long post about really silly problem.

I was reminded of another fuse story, this is from back in the 80s:

My company had two customers located in a different area, in cities about two hours apart.  One was an evaluation system we had provided to a prospective customer.  It was located at the customer's R&amp;D center in a suburb of the main city.  The other customer was a large multi branch operation that we were working on getting installed.  Over thirty locations covering the entire county.   

We had not hired a local service tech yet so a group of three of us were taking weekly turns in the area.  Fly up on Monday, rent a car, check into a hotel, get to work.  Friday, check out of hotel, do some work, turn in rental car, fly home.  

On one of my turns, as soon as I land and get my rental car, I call the office to check in.  R&amp;D customer reports system is down, no other info.  I call the customer contact, who's not very helpful.  Isn't interested in doing anything with me on the phone, I just need to get there as soon as I can.  I'm 90 minutes to two hours away, but he has priority, his system is down.  Call the closer customer, sorry, won't be in today, going to the suburbs.

Drive to the other customer site, into machine room, there's the system, no LEDs lit at all, so power issue.  Check voltages at the power bus, one voltage missing.  Could be power supply or a fuse, but the fuse is not accessible, its integrated into the power supply, which is mounted inside a chassis, which is mounted to the equipment rack.  

I call in and update my boss, I'm going to check the fuse but I may need a power supply shipped to me.  I'm loosing one day of work for the other customer but that can't be helped.  This R&amp;D customer is a huge bank and if we sell them what we hope, they'll be our largest customer by far, so they are priority one.  

The chassis with the power supplies is mounted at about the five foot level in this rack.  Right above it is a fan tray.  Need to remove that first.  I kill the power to the rack and start removing the screws that hold the fan tray into the rack.  From one side I can reach in and get good purchase with a screw driver, screws have been put in with power tools and I'm sweating that I'm going to mess up the screw heads, but I get one side out.  Now the other side.  Cabinet sidewall forces me to snake my arm from the back holding a screw driver, get the screwdriver into the screw by touch, then try and turn it.  I can't.  My arm is fully stretched out and I can't get decent torque on the screw driver, I'm just going to mess up the screw heads.  

OK, the cabinet side can be removed, then I'll have good access to the screws.  Oops, external disk drive, shopping cart sized, is right next to the computer cabinet.  OK, carefully check all the cables see if there's any slack, there's a bit.  Fish out some cable and gently slide the disk drive away from cabinet.   Carefully remove the cabinet sidewall, great now I can see all the screws.  

Remove the fan tray,  the chassis has a screen top and bottom held in by small screws.  I can reach the top screws now, pop the screen off the top, and by craning my neck I can seen down into it.  There's the power supply, there's the fuse!  The fuse holder the type with the slot for a screw driver.  There is no way I can get a screw driver into the chassis, the power supply has maybe an inch of clearance between it and the side of the chassis.  

I am really cursing the home office engineers who laid this out.  If they wanted to make more difficult to replace a fuse they could not have.  I'm sure it looked really pretty when they made the drawings.  

So I'm going to have to unscrew the power supply from the chassis so I can twist it and point the fuse holder up.  But the screws that hold the power supply to the chassis attach from the bottom.  I have to carefully rotate the whole chassis, with power lead harness, so I can get to the bottom and remove the bottom screen.  The power harness has no single disconnect, its individual wires connected to various terminal strips, I could disconnect all of these and move the chassis to a desk, but maybe I can leave the harness connected.  Yes I can.  I can get the chassis propped up so I can remove the bottom screen, and remove the screws holding the power supply in.  Pop the fuse holder, check the fuse, its dead Jim.  Dig through my tool bag, I don't have the exact fuse, but one slightly lower amperage.  Well, worth a try.  Pop the fuse in, gently stack the chassis back, and power everything up.  System comes up, boots normally.  

Tell the customer I'm going to grab a quick lunch, looks good, should be done soon.  Run to Radio Shack (remember those?), buy the correct fuse and run back.  Swap the fuse, test, all ok.  Start re-installing the various items.  Power supply has four screws holding it in, I decide two will work.  Bottom screen on chassis seems like over kill, into my tool bag it goes.  Chassis remounted, screws tightened to normal human torque.  Top screen replaced, half the screws will do fine.  Fan tray replaced, cabinet side replaced, disk drive eased back to normal position.  System powered up and runs fine.  Fuse blew for no reason, as they sometimes do.  

By this time its almost 5pm.  My hotel is back near the other customer, so I have a couple hours drive ahead of me.   I hook up with the project manager for the R&amp;D folks, different guy than I talked to earlier.  I apologize that it took all day to replace a fuse, he just laughs and waves my apology aside.  He points across the large test lab room we're in to a group of guys stand in front of a what looks like a fancy card sorting machine.  This machine is built by a really large cash register company, you can guess the name.  There are five guys standing there, four in suites and one guy on the end in a green sports shirt.  He tells me this Really Big Cash Register company is trying to sell them this equipment and it doesn't work.  The guys in suits have all flown in from another state, the green shirt guy is their local tech.   He tells me they've been on site for a couple of weeks and the only one who's made any progress is the local green shirt guy.  So, he's totally not worried about my company. 

Anyway, just some rambling memories from an old guy, remembering a job that no longer exists!",1,1625861896

2511,"sometimes you get lucky, vacuum cleaner vs the computer","Way back in the olden days I was a service tech for a computer company.  I worked out of an office that included sales and admin staff, plus the service folks like me.

My company made a slimmed down version of our flagship system, that was sold as being able to operate in a standard office environment.  No special A/C or power required.  It was a single rack requiring a single 110v power supply.  About the size of a 4 drawer file cabinet.  

We had one of these in a sales office, not in our machine room.  The lady who worked with this system was really cool, and she reported that once in a while she was finding the system locked up when she came in.  Didn't happen every day, not even every week.  Never happened during the day, only at night, when no one was using it.  I told her it was probably going to have to get worse before we could even attempt to fix it, the problem was just too intermittent.  And she was OK with this since she realized we couldn't duplicate the issue.

Anyway, one night I had to come into the office for some reason which I've forgotten.  I noticed the janitors were there and one was running a vacuum cleaner the hallway right next the office that housed the ""problem"" system.  I had keys to all the offices so I popped in and the system was locked up.   It was plugged into an outlet that shared a wall with the hallway, and vacuum cleaner was plugged into an outlet on the common wall.  

I powered the system off, moved the power cord to a different outlet, rebooted it and left.  I figured the two outlets were probably on the same circuit, but maybe I'd get lucky.   Next day I told the sales lady what I had done, and we'd see if anything changed.  I then forgot about it.

Couple of weeks later I remembered and checked with the sales lady, she had not had to reboot the system since I moved the power cord, so all good.  

So, yes, our systems can operate in an regular office, as long as you don't mind dirty floors.",1,1625854166
2512,one of my longest service calls ever,"This story goes way back to '91.  I was a field service tech for a computer company in the Western U.S.  My territory was pretty large, basically half of a U.S. state.  I had one large customer in the city I lived in, a smaller customer about 2 hours drive away, and a third customer 4 hours away in a different city.  Needless to say, I did a lot of driving.

The systems I supported were minicomputers from the 80s.   Computers, tape backup systems, external disk drives (the old fashioned big-as-a-washing-machine type).  Plus telecom devices, printers, dumb terminals, we provided service for everything and got paid pretty well.  This is all pre-internet, and PCs where fairly new.

Anyway, I got a call from my 2 hour away customer first thing one morning.  They had a terrible storm the night before, lightning strikes all around, plus a power outage, the system is down.  Do some troubleshooting over the phone, computer has various LED indicators on the front panel, AC power is on, all else dark.  External disks are in standby mode, fans running but media is not spinning.  I figure one of the power supplies is fried, I have no spares but jump in my car and head up.

Arrive on site, pull out my digital meter and start checking voltages.  All the power supplies are in a common chassis so its easy.   And in less than five minutes I find one of the 5 volt power supplies is dead.  This has no internal fuse and I can see its getting input voltage.  Get on the phone to my parts support.  I need one of these power supplies boxed and put on a plane if at all possible.  Overnight is second best but please try and get it to me.   And (this is a really important part), there are TWO versions of this power supply for different models of this system.  They are NOT interchangable, I must have the newer/larger/heavier version.  No problem, they'll call me back.

I poke around to see I can find any other damage.  Explain to the customer that there may be additional things broken, but I can't troubleshoot until I have the power supply replaced.   Parts guy calls me back, they don't have one in the office, they sent it to Houston, guy in Houston will box and put it on a plane to me.  I call the guy in Houston, who I've worked with for ages, he's totally reliable and tells me he's on his way to the airport, he'll call me when its shipped.  I have a 2.5 hour drive from the site to the airport, so if I leave soon I'll get there around when the package arrives.  Explain to the customer, I'll be back when I have the power supply, they will arrange after hours access for me, just in case.    So far, things going as good as I could hope.  

Drive to the airport, find the air freight office, they have my package, all is good.  Airline guy hands me the box and my hearts skips.  The box is too light, this is the older version of the power supply.  I rip the box open, yep, wrong part.  I find a pay phone (no cell phone in those days).  Call my parts guy and rip him a new one.  Houston customers have none of the older systems, this should have never been sent.  They check with the Houston guy, that's the only one he has.  They promise to find the correct part for me.

I call the customer, sorry, wrong part, we're working on it.  I'll call them back, might be tomorrow before I have it.  Customer is pretty cool, glad I'm keeping them in the loop.  I head home and wait for an update.  Parts guy pages me (remember pagers?), he's getting the part from our East Coast office.  They will overnight it to the customer.  I agree since if they overnight it to me I won't get it until after 10AM, then I have to drive up.  I'll drive up and be waiting for it.   Cool!

Call the customer, there's a wrinkle.  The customer is a government installation, all package deliveries go to the central warehouse, sometimes it takes hours to locate stuff,  arg.  I call my parts guy back, can they overnight it to me instead?  He calls and checks, no its already gone.  Call customer back and explain.  OK, we'll work with what we have.

Next morning, drive to the site, meet with me contact and we head over to the main warehouse.  Guys there ask what the PO number is, that's how they track everything.  Explain that there's no PO number, its a spare part, small box, blah, blah.  Guys kind of hem and hah, after some moaning and groaning agree to look for the box.   After some time, they find the box, its been opened (looking for paperwork I guess), but its the correct power supply!  Hooray!

Back to the machine room, install the power supply, all LEDs light up, all voltages check correctly, now just boot up and away we go.  Except the boot fails, first disk drive which contains the OS faults.  Clear the fault, try again, same thing.  OK, this happens sometimes, disk file system got corrupted due to power or lightning.   There's an alternate procedure to boot into maintenance mode from a tape, from here I can reformat the disk, restore the OS, and then boot normally.  And I'll be able to check the other two disks for damage and data loss.

Find the correct tape, get the system booted up (I'm feeling ok about the CPU at this point), and start formatting the disk drive.  Normally takes about an hour, fingers crossed.  After getting though part of the formatting, program fails.  Too many errors on the media, the format program can not work around them.  This is bad.  I'm thinking if one disk is bad, what about the other two.  Call my tech support guy, he shares my concerns.  He will get our parts guy working on find new media for me while I work.

He suggests changing the addresses on the disk drives so either the second or third is the ""first"" and try to format it.  This will erase all data on this disk so I check with the customer.  They are OK with this, it means they will have to do a full restore from tape, but if it will speed things up, they are in.  I change the addressing, which is really easy, and try to format a different disk.  No luck, fails in a similar matter.  Try the third disk, same thing.  Call my tech support guy back.

Wants me to swap the disk media from the other two disks into the first drive and see if I can at least get one disk up and running with the OS on it.  This a total long shot and we would never do this except getting me replacement media is going to take a day at least.   Customer doesn't care, their data is gone anyway so they are looking at the full multi hour restore.  

Swap media from the second drive to the first and try to format.  Fails like before, media can not be formatted.  Try the third media, same result.  Call my tech support guy back, I need three sets of media, and I need them as fast as I can get them.  I'm also thinking that each set of media, called an HDA (head-disk assembly), comes on a small pallet in a special foam/box, I can maybe fit one in my car, but not three.  Each HDA weighs about 70 pounds.

My support guy calls back.  They are having 3 HDAs air freighted to me, they'll arrive at the airport that night.  Call my wife and ask her to get on the phone and rent me a van at the airport.  It can be a mini van, I'll take the seats out.   Talk to the customer, update them, I'll be working all night most likely, is that OK?  Sure, they give me a key and notify security that I'll be there.  Call my wife, she found me a mini van, rental car guys are cool, they'll pull the seats out and store them for me.  Back into my car and head to the airport.

Get to the airport and park, get the parking shuttle to the airport, catch the rental car shuttle and they have the van ready, so far, so good.  Head to air freight, pickup the pallets, airline guys help me load them up, I'll be on my own at the customer's site.

Drive back to the site, now well after dark.  Back the van right up to the front door (site is closed so no big deal, I'm not in anyone's way).  Unbox one HDA and carry it in to the machine room, install it, power up, start formatting.  And it works!  Get the drive formatted, install the OS, reboot as normal, now have a working system.  Run standard disk check while I'm lugging in the second HDA.

Install the second HDA, power up the second disk drive, fire up the disk formatting program (different program for disks that are not the first one).  And the program is NOT found.  Spend some time looking in various directories then I remember.   Our phone support folks had been instructed to remove the program from all customer's systems because a few were purchasing third party disk drives and adding them to their systems.  So the format program was deleted and all field techs were given a tape with the program on it.  If we ever needed it, we were supposed to restore it from our tape, run it, then delete it from disk when we were done.  I know I have the tape but its in my car at the airport.  I search to see if there's another tape on site.  Can't find it.    Cursing myself I lug the last HDA into the machine room, jump in the rental van and head back to the airport.

Get to airport in record time since its now the middle of the night and there's little traffic, I think it took 90 minutes.  Into the parking area, find my car, grab the tape, back in the van, attendant lets me leave w/o paying since I was there less than five minutes.  Back to customer.

Its now early in the morning, I get the second drive formatted, run the check program, get the third drive formatted and checked.  While this is going on I get the bad HDAs boxed up in the van and labeled for shipping.   Everything now is in the customer's hands, they'll have to restore all their data and have the software support folks assist them getting things back to normal.  I leave a note for the customer since no one is in yet.  I'm pretty wiped out by now, but get in the mini van and head back to airport to ship the parts back.

I'm cruising along the highway, the Eastern sky is beginning to get light, sun will be coming up soon.   My pager goes off.  I can't effing believe it.  I'm in the middle of nowhere but there's one spot with a gas station and convenience store coming up.  There's a pay phone there.  Call into the dispatch folks, my 4 hour away customer is completely down.   I call them, system is down, no LEDs on the front panel.  Great, another power supply or fuse (this customer has older version so the power supply I was shipped by mistake will actually work in their system).  Plus it has an internal fuse that is difficult to reach but I should be able to get them up and running.  I explain I've had no sleep and can't drive, but there's a puddle jumper airline I can catch, I'll call them back.  Call my wife (she's awake), can she call the airline and get me a seat?  Customer will pick me up at the airport and get me a motel room.

I start driving again, get to the airport.  My wife pages me, I've missed the morning flight, there's one in the evening.  Fine.  I ship the bad parts, turn in the rental van, pick up my car, go home and call the site I've been working on for the past couple of days.   They are OK, restore is in progress, things are looking good.  I get about three hours sleep.

That afternoon I head back to the airport, get the puddle jumper, fly to the other city, its now dark.  Customer picks me up and we drive to the site.  Staff gone except for the operations folks.  Yank out my meter, no 5 volts.  Feel like I'm having flashbacks.

Takes about twenty minutes to unbutton things so I can get to the power supply and dismount it so I can get to the fuse (its a bad design, the fuse holder is up against the side of the chassis so you can't get to the fuse).   Pull the fuse, its blown.  Okay, did it blow for a reason or just for yucks?  Replace the fuse and set everything back so I can power things up.  System powers up and boots fine.  Great.  Power off and refasten all the stuff I had to undo to get to the stupid fuse, power up, they are in business.

Customer drops me off at a motel and I totally crash.  Wake up the next day and call the customer, everything is fine, system is up, they are catching up from the outage.  I have a ticket for puddle jumper, call a cab and I'm off to the airport.

I clocked a huge amount of overtime that week, but a large amount was billed back to the customer since power and lightning damage was not covered by the service contract.  My boss was happy because so much of the work was billable.",1,1625846678

2518,Redneck Repairs,"TLDR; I see how long I can keep a computer alive while doing as little actual repairs to it as possible.

I grew up poor. Very little money. Clothes often had wear holes in them. Family sometimes ate what we found on the edge of the road that someone killed with their car. Poor. School's IT guy taught me a few things and I got pretty good with the square peg goes into the square hole type of tech repair. Math and logic were easy so I took up programming even though the school's instructor basically said, ""Here is a book, I know nothing."" Literally.

Fast forward and I'm in college for video game design and development and they give us these laptops that were ours as part of our tuition. Not a loaner that the school wanted back. This was MY laptop. It was severely under-powered for the amount of graphical rendering that we were going to be doing on it, but I couldn't afford the upgrade as I was also paying (about 90-95% of my paychecks) for rent and tuition at the same time from the two jobs I was working. Laptop's came with free lifetime tech support as well as 2 year free repairs and replacements on all parts. They also threw in the OS install CDs.

Six months go by and my laptop battery won't hold a charge. I call up the warranty center and it turns out that the battery is not covered under the warranty due to some stupid loophole where because it's not made by the company, it's not part of it. Whatever, laptop becomes a desktop and always needs to be plugged in.

2 more months and in a marathon gaming session I start to smell what I would later learn is overheating electronics. Computer goes black. I call tech support, they send a guy. Several internal components are melted. He replaces them all, except the battery. I buy a cookie cooling rack to keep my laptop on.

Another two years go by, mouse pad stops working. No worries, call up tech support, turns out the touch pad has a hardware fault, nothing they can do as its no longer under warranty. Whatever, I buy a portable mouse. Still good.

Hardrive failure. Buy a new hardrive, install, re-install OS.

Computer has minimal functionality, no wifi. (first computer, remember?) I call tech support, they teach me about drivers. No way to actually get them on a computer that doesn't have wifi. I go to a relatives house, spend 3 hours on the phone with tech support and they walk me through downloading every driver for every piece of equipment on that computer. Install drivers, everything is working again (except mouse and battery). I inquire about data recovery and they told me best bet was geek squad and an external hardrive for backups in the future.

Buy external hardrive and get data recovered. From now on, very careful about backing up files.

Few more months go by: intake fan failure (found out when talking to tech support computer that the laptop originally had a fan to circulate air though it as well as a CPU fan). Computer now gets hot VERY quick even when on cookie cooling rack. Only way to use computer now is to rest on both knees and keep space under clear for ventilation. If I kept it on a table, would get BSOD in under 10 mins, cookie cooling rack extended time to 1 hour based on season (Wisconsin winters helped extend the use times if I used it near an open window). Computer is still good.

Can't remember when but power supply starts to fray. Due to the way the power supply was made and repeated bending of the cord because I couldn't use the computer without it, the internal copper wires that carried electricity started to fray and I had to bend the cord at ever so slight an angle to get it to work. Bumping it with my foot in the slightest would cause it to instantly power off due to the corrupted battery. Learned to position the power supply strategically.

Two more years, dual internal and external simultaneous hardrive failure. Buy new hardrive, back to geek squad. Now rocking two external hardrives as well as the internal and a few thumb drives for super important things.

Another year, internal network card failure. I buy an external network card, rig it up, all good. Keep on pressing soldier!

Two more years and the laptop screen spring fails. Computer screen will no longer stand up on its own. Cut a strip of plexi-glass, take blowtorch to it to bend it so it will support the back of the laptop screen when opened. Grab string and tie in a loop at proper size to hold back of laptop screen to the plexi-glass so it won't accidentally close. Learn proper position of plexi-glass stand to prevent overheating. Still functional but more of a chore to set up and move with.

Three months, Power supply protective coating fails. Power cord belches 6in wide fireball 12in off of cord when cord is plugged in. Plug removed from wall. Power cord cut, wires spliced, wrapped in electrical tape, then hot glued a protective coating around it. No longer manufacturer safe but STILL functional!

3 more years, OS stability issues, cause unknown. Lucky to go two weeks without need an OS reinstall.

6 more months, motherboard failure. RIP Frankenstein's monster.

I didn't count all the times I had to do reinstall due to OS corruption. Side note, I still have it.",1,1625779749
2519,"third interviewee, my team dodges a bullet","Wow, kind of surprised at the comments, since there's interest in the ""final candidate"", here is the story. 

This candidate, hereafter X, was the actual reason I had checked with HR on whether I needed to interview all internal applications. 

I had attended a few meetings that X also attended.  Probably everyone has dealt with a similar person.  Always has a comment on every subject discussed, always has a story about how hard their situation is, but they manage to overcome all problems no matter what.  Conversation is filled with techno-speak that often does not make sense and you know they are blowing smoke but you don't have the time or energy to call them on it, you just want to be out of the blasted meeting so you can do your job.

Anyway, I see X has applied forthe position.  I check with HR, they say I should interview all the internal applicants.  Sigh, ok.  I happen to know someone I trust that works close to X, not in X's actual group, but knew X fairly well.    I call this trusted person and carefully say that I'm not going to ask their opinion, they don't have to say anything, but I will just plainly state that X has applied for a position in my group.  There's a moment of silence, followed by peals of laughter, that go on for about a minute.  So, I have my answer as to what trusted person's opinion of X is.  When trusted person finally calms down, they carefully state they don't want to comment on whether X would be a good hire or not.  But they do say that ""I think it would be a great thing for my group if you were to hire X"".  Enough said.

But, we have to interview X.  So, X's interview rolls around, and I'm very lucky to have a super smart professor on my panel.  This professor has one of the best BS detectors of anyone I work with.  We go through the interview with X and the professor is hardly asking any questions, he's sitting very quietly.  We finish up with X and I'm a bit worried.  X can BS like nobody's business and I'm worried some on the panel may have fallen for it.  After X leaves the room, professor turns to me with a look of horror and asks why the hell we interviewed X?   X clearly knows nothing, he's totally blowing smoke, am I out of my mind?  Sighing with relief I lay out what HR told me, and I mention the reaction I got from the trusted person I called.  Professor thinks for a moment and says they understand, but do we have anymore of these people?  No, the rest are outside candidates and one in particular looks really good, in fact we probably can't pay enough to get them.  

Luckily the person we wanted was working for a business that was in major trouble and they really wanted to jump ship quickly.  And there was much rejoicing.",1,1625779573
2520,Always keep your system up-to-date,"This is a straight-forward story about an user who had no clue how outdated his system was...

So this one lady complains about her workstation being slow as hell. Nothing special, the PC is about two years old now but was been equipped from the factory with an HDD. Everything else - RAM, CPU, programs... Seemed fine. So we ordered an SSD from Samsung for her, took the PC away for two hours and cloned the old drive onto the new one. Installed the Samsung dedicated software to monitor the SSD and gave the user her refreshed PC.

Two weeks later, we get a complain ticket that we didn't fix anything, the PC is still slow as hell. Alllllrighty then..... I remote onto the damn station and first thing I do is check for system integrity - maybe some Windows files got broken during the cloning (happens sometimes) and do an overall check of the hard drive - everything is fine. Then I do the last thing left - check if there were any new drivers. Lo and behold, I get a list of over 50 outdated drivers that Windows Update is trying to pull in.

This PC did receive virtually NO UPDATES for the past two years. Now, if the chipset is running on two-years-old drivers and the programs that use this chipset to almost it's maximum were written just a month ago... It's obvious everything is slowing down.

I do a quick chiech on the optional updates, install 21H1, and leave the thing to do an update and restart at the end of the workday. Next day everything is fine.

2521,A story from a (L)user,"This just happened yesterday. 

I'm at work, doing my job, and while there's semi-down-time (as customers are in the middle of participating in our service) I am engaging in renewing some certifications (needed for certain aspects of my job). I go to the email I received reminding me that I need to renew and click on the link. It takes me to a login screen. 

Up to now, it is a normally boring training activity performed by someone who has a very boring job. Except when I login, it tells me I'm not authorized to view the page. Weird. I reset my password and login again. Same result. I try a couple of different browsers, same result for all of them. 

Okay, something is obviously wrong on the certifying company's end, so I reply to the original email that I'm having trouble, describe it, and even send a screen shot of the ""not authorized"" page. After ten minutes I get a return reply. 

The reply states that I have to include my site code number with all requests for assistance in the future. That's it. No instructions, nothing. 

I don't know our site code number for this particular program off the top of my head (we have dozens of third-party programs that we use, all with different information used to login). So I go searching through binders and emails and saved files looking for it. After a while, I think I've found it, but it turns out I'm wrong, and so I have to keep looking. 

A quick text to my boss and I finally find the ""needed"" information (to be fair to the guy in the email, they've got security policies that have to be followed, I get it, but at the time I was thinking, ""I responded to ***your*** email, and you don't want to help me without some silly code number?!?!"") and I send it. 

He replies with ""you must be using either Firefox or Chrome.""

Now, I've already tried both of those (and a couple of others), but I try them again. No dice, same result. I email him back letting him know. 

He tells me ""you must be fully signed out before you try to sign in again. Make sure to close your browser and open it again, before you try to login.""

I follow his instructions. I even shut down all my programs and restart the computer. It doesn't make a difference, I get the same result. I email him the news. 

This time he says, ""I don't see any red flags on your account, but I've reset it anyway. You're good to go.""

Nope. Nothing. Same result. Another email. 

After about another half hour or so, I get his reply, ""Please make sure you are using the login: Lastname0#, and not FirstInitialLastname as your username. Please confirm.""

Head-palm. 

Most (actually, ***all)*** of my third-party logins have the username as first initial last name and maybe a number (unless they just use my email address from my company)... except this one. 

I try the different username and voila, I'm in! I email him back, thanking him, letting him know I was using the wrong username, and wishing him a great day. He replies in kind. I then spend the next hour doing a boring recert that is way too many parts (I do pass it and am now qualified to do that part of my job again). 

I am not in IT, but I do provide some level of IT support to my customers (when I'm providing remote services for those customers). Mostly I'm using hard-earned experience, guess-work (because I usually can't see the customer's computer), and plain luck. I don't get extra money for it (I doubt my company has the money for it, even if I ***were*** qualified, which I'm not), but if I don't do it, I can't do my job. 

This tale has been one from the perspective of a grateful user. Thanks, IT guy over the email, wherever you are!",1,1625767904
2522,interviewee has second thoughts,"Kind of long, but here goes:

Another story from days working for a University.  My job was systems administration for a medium sized research and teaching department.  We basically handled everything from servers, to networks, to security.  I was one half of a two person team, which was manageable as long as both team members were fairly competent.  

However as time passed my co worker moved on new career, which meant I had to pick up the full work load, plus I did most of the recruiting work.   As long as I could move things along, it would be OK, we'd get the job posted, collect applications, select candidates and schedule interviews.  All typical hiring activities, except our department was considered a better place to work than other University IT areas, and so we tended to get a LOT of applications from folks with questionable qualifications.

Our main IT group on campus was fairly large.  There were web developers, database administrators, network engineers, and managers.   Lots and lots of managers.  A fair number of these managers where old timers who's skills were pretty rusty, but they were making fairly high salaries and counting the days until they could retire with a nice pension.  This meant there was little room for advancement for folks doing the actual work, so these folks tended to apply to our positions since we paid better, plus it was a cooler job.

Anyway, on this particular hiring cycle, I got several applications from people who had very limited experience in what we needed.  If these applications had come from outside I would have rejected them out of hand, but HR warned me that folks that were already University employees were more likely to protest if we didn't interview them, and this would delay our hiring, and basically it would make more work for me, so better interview them at least.   So, I scheduled interviews for the three internal applicants, rolling my eyes as I did.

One candidate was clearing looking for a management job and it became clear that he wasn't interested part way through the interview.  One down, two to go.   This story concerns the second candidate, the third will have a separate post in the future.   The second candidate had been doing database administration, but had some basic sysadmin experience.  I reeled off the services we  provided, an overview of our network topology, and user requirements.   The candidate got very quiet while I recited this longish list, and then asked, ""how big is the team?"".   No one had ever asked this before but I just raised my hand and said, ""you're looking at it"".  Candidate's eyes got very large and it was clear they were uncomfortable.  We ran through the rest of the interview but it was clear to the entire panel that this person was NOT interested, (frankly they looked scared to death) which was fine with us.  

We managed to hire someone from outside, who turned out to a super co worker.",1,1625766206
2523,School the Principal and their IT,"I was reminded of this recently as my wife was working with Apple support for a different issue. Back when my child was in middle school, all the students in their class were issued iPads as part of some learning activity. This was in late fall and the iPads were turned back in sometime early February when that part of the course was completed. An effort to learn technology. And of course, the school didn’t bother to reset the iPads for the next academic year until late summer. Therefore, the principle was calling us and telling us that we were going to be billed for an iPad because they couldn’t reset it. 

Um what? No, that’s not how the world works. There’s no contract on this. You can’t make an agreement with any minors. Yah, good luck with that Mr. Principle. Why can’t your IT folk reset it? Because they don’t have the password for it. Now for the life of me, I can’t figure out why my child is different compared to all the other kids. Maybe on the day they turned it in, they had to turn it in unlocked or something? Maybe my kid wasn’t there that day? And why the wait of almost half a year after turning it in to refresh it? You would think that would be the first thing the next week while kids are still in school and available. Nope. 

Does my child remember the password? Of course not. Middle schooler brain here. Can’t fault them for that. They do remember being told to make a unique and difficult password though, one they don’t normally use for anything else. Can’t write it down and other password tips. Mission accomplished. No longer in memory. No record of it. Best I can figure things, my kid was absent when the iPads were turned in so any transfer of the password or unlocking the device before turning it in never happened. 

Mr. Principle still insists that we will be paying for it. Nope. Not going to happen. So my wife gets the details of the iPad and armed with my kid’s user ID which was known by the school, off she goes to Apple support who are able to quickly find the information, see the iPad is owned by the school and resets the password to something generic that my wife then turns over to Mr. Principle along with how it was resolved. Gee, maybe instead of threatening folks you can get an IT staff that can call a help desk instead. I was surprised Apple worked with us given we weren’t the owners of that iPad, but perhaps they encountered this a lot and knew the situation. 

My only hope is that other families didn’t get hit with this or were tricked into paying. Also hope that maybe the school will learn how to use technology better. I know, dream big.",1,1625764859
2524,"Standards Exist For A Reason, or, Don't Step On My Toes With That REGEX","So, we run a variety of microservices inside a Docker stack. Rather than expose each microservice's port to the outside world, we run NGINX exposed on port 443 and have it handle the routing. Now, the developers maintain the NGINX configuration for the stack. They add the location block parsing configuration so that when a microservice request comes in from the tomcat application in the Web layer, that location block forces security token processing. This ensures that calls made to the microservice must come from an authenticated session in Tomcat, and that those calls are routed to the correct microservice. The architecture also allows microservice-to-microservice calls to stay inside Docker: if one microservice needs to make a call to another one, it doesn't need a token because it just makes the call directly, bypassing NGINX. This works pretty well, but relies on all of the developers following a standard convention on how the name the URLs for the microservices. For example, a user management service might be accessed with ""/user-management-service/CLIENT/"" but would be called ""user-management-ms"".  


Now, WE maintain the infrastructure. When the developers are ready for a new microservice to go into the user testing environment, they give us a ticket. We put the microservice into the docker compose file and add it to a list of services that the deployment pipeline is going to process. We also add an alive check URL location block to a file that we manage. The deployment pipeline injects the contents of this file into the NGINX configuration. The URL follows a standard: microservice-name/alive. This is important: because the alive check isn't JUST used by the monitoring service to let us know if a microservice has crashed...it's also used by the deployment pipeline. The pipeline ruins through the list of microservices and generates a script which will docker-compose up each microservice, the run a curl against [https://localhost/microservice-name/alive](https://localhost/microservice-name/alive). If there's an issue, the deployment will bomb out.  


And that's where the idiot developers come in. You see, NGINX parses locations from top to bottom. The first match in the regex is the one it uses. The developers added a location for their microservice as ""\^/client-operations/(CLIENT)/user-management-service"" which adds the token processing and the rewrites the URI as ""$1"" (so, the client name) and proxy\_pass it to  [http://user-management-ms](http://client-management-ms). Cool. This works. When a client logs in to the application and goes to the user management portal, it sends those calls to the microservice for handling. The deployment works, and we're happy.  


Until today.  


So this morning, there's a test environment deployment. New guy is running it, and he tells me it's failing. Then he asks if I've ever seen a 401 error on an alive check. 401 is a problem with the security token, and should never happen on an alive check. I run the curl command from inside the microservice container, and it returns the correct ""I'm alive"" JSON data. I run it from inside the NGINX container, same thing. I run it from the docker host and get a 401. That's when I start picking through the nginx.conf file. You see, I was the one who initially set up this microservice, and I know for a fact that it WAS working. And there, in the developer-maintained section of the file, is a new location block. 

Some time last week, development got a request to add this capability to the super secret internal management application that we use. Ignoring the conventions that exist for a goddamned reason, the developers added code to the web application that would make a call to ""/user-management-ms/(CLIENT)"". Some time yesterday, they added a location block to the nginx config for ""\^/user-management-ms/(.\*)"" which includes all of the necessary security token processing. The problem is that this part of the file is BEFORE our alive checks get injected. And ""/user-management-ms/alive"" matches THIS block first, NGINX checks for the security token and doesn't find it, and kicks out a 401 error. Which bombs the deployment. 

New guy submits an emergency change to remove the microservice from the list, and when it's rerun, the pipeline doesn't try to bring this one up, nor does it check to see if it's alive. I anticipate getting a ticket later today complaining that the microservice is no longer available, and can we please fix it. At which point we will happily tell development to fix the location block so that it doesn't step on my alive check first.",1,1625759667

I'm very proud (and a bit drunk) to present the most important point I've ever had to defend.

A while back, I worked at an office that had a lot of users that hated IT. They would ask for things, or request them, and then not get them. I was the IT person, and I just kept saying ""We don't do that"". It just made them mad, because they knew they had a problem and I was just brushing them off.

2528,When the interviewee knows the business better than the business does,"It's always useful to keep a finger on the job market pulse.

&amp;#x200B;

I had an alert come up for a posterchild company that had just gotten out of the garage start-up phase and was making waves through an industry that I'm intimately familiar with. These guys had it all - captive market, really cool product, young and fresh ideas, deep pockets, free reign to build IT as I saw fit, and an awesome office with great views. It was really a bonus when I found out that their office was across the road from a coffee bun place - they are so delicious. 

The role itself was fairly senior and would be integral in defining company strategy and product direction. My personal experience would help them avoid many of the pitfalls of the in industry and my contacts would lubricate many of the challenges they would come up against as they commercialised their product, and they were actually desperate for someone who could do just that.. All this from a Head of IT. lol

Yes please, gimme.

Called up the recruiter, and within about 15 minutes they were begging.

First round interview, straight to the top. You know that feeling when you've gelled perfectly with the interviewers, there's total alignment, and you've got it in the bag. The only thing that made my eyebrows raise a bit was it looked like everyone was in their 20's. I rewarded myself with a coffee bun.

Second round interview was a bit strange.. There was probably about a dozen people in the panel from across the business.. Engineering, marketing, product development, compliance, and half the C suite. And it lasted about 3.5 hours. lolwot. Once again, I'm the oldest person in the room by a significant margin.

And this is where it actually fell apart.

What became very apparent to me is that the company had no idea about the market they were playing in. Everybody was so focused on their own part of the puzzle that nobody had their eye on the bigger picture - in fact they had no idea about the scale of the bigger picture... Including all the CxO's in the room. The compliance activities that they thought would open the door to commercial opportunity in this industry was merely a gate-check prior to being invited to talk to the real certification bodies... And they had no idea about the soul crushing body of work that was just past what they thought the finish line was. Then I started to give them a rundown on things like defence clearances, reporting requirements, ITAR and EAR, the local regulatory regime, how to integrate nationality requirements within the bounds of employment law, the different standards bodies and their relative importance, change management, advanced persistent threat, ASD-8 / NIST800-171 / etc, the various government grants available, etc, etc. 

I already knew this job wasn't for me, but invested the time in trying to prepare them anyway in the same way that a senior will help to teach a junior. I could see the CxO's getting more uncomfortable each time I peeled another layer off the proverbial onion while the engineers were faithfully taking notes. Probably saved them a bunch of consulting costs.

On my way out, I got another rewarding coffee bun. Yum :)

At the end of the day, I withdrew my application, and the recruiter let me know that they canned the position anyway.. The budget was going to be spent on more compliance people instead. lol

2530,Your Job is on the line because I made a mistake!!,"Hello good people! I don't work in actual tech support, but I just needed to rant. Obligatory warning: on mobile, don't speak English etc.

Backstory: I work at a bank, overseeing deferred electronic fund transfers. That is to say, these transfers are not instantaneous. These transfers are pooled together and settled periodically after a time window. I don't suck at my job, but over the last three years I've been subjected to piss-poor performance reviews due to a botched employee review system. Basically, my department has a substantial number of employees, and number of years in service gets a huge mark in performance metrics - that's where I come at the bottom. I've spent long enough time fixing other people's fuckups, and I've seen those same guys - seniors and juniors, not in my department - getting promoted. But I digress.

Recently my bank launched interbank electronic transfer through the official android app (I know, we're still living in the stone age). Therefore, any dispute that couldn't be solved by the point of contact would get escalated to me. Although I usually don't have to deal with yelling customers, reviewing every ""unsolvable"" dispute takes significant work hours. Incidentally, 99% of those disputes are actually non-issues. These disputes arise mostly from poorly informed customers not understanding the new service.

So one such issue was escalated to me today. Customer had issued a fund transfer instruction through the new android app from his account to another bank account on a public holiday (3 days ago). They later called CC to complain that the fund hadn't been transferred to the other bank's account. Upon digging, I discovered that during this holiday, the central bank had taken their switch offline, and loads of xml instructions pile up as a result. Our IT guys had pushed the xmls when the central bank switch came online. But the switch buckled under the pressure (every other bank was doing the same thing!). Therefore, the mentioned instruction did not get through to the receiving bank until the next day. After that, the fund was rejected by the receiving bank due to ""invalid account number"". The fund rebounded to us, and we had in turn refunded to the customer the following day (today). I laid out everything as clearly as I could, and closed the ticket. Or so I thought.

An hour later, the deputy of complaint management cell was on a call with me. These guys are dreaded throughout the bank, because if they got you, there will be no write-up or anything. You'll simply get a termination letter as soon as HR could sign it. Anyways, the complaint cell executive informed me that they've forwarded a complain mail from the aforementioned customer to me. They also sounded fairly panicked, and I understood why after opening the mail from the customer. The mail was CC'd to the central bank's complaint cell as well, and many heads would roll if the central bank got involved.

At this point I have a job waiting for me (ironically it's teaching English!). It's half the pay, but far better job security. So I thought, ""eff it!"" and went to reply to the mail. As I was plotting the best counter attack, I noticed a tiny detail. The customer mail actually mentions that they had issued the transfer instruction to a VISA debit card number! That explained why the receiving bank thought the account was invalid.

So I replied:

Dear Sir,
We found that,

Customer had initiated a transfer request on a public holiday.

The XML was sent to the central bank yesterday, rejected by the receiving bank on the same day due to invalid destination account number.

Refunded to customer account after central bank refunded us today.

It's been our experience that receiving banks usually do not accept VISA debit card numbers as a destination account number for electronic transfers. The cards are usually linked to a checking/savings account. Customers should always use that checking/savings account number for fund transfer purposes, otherwise fund transfers may be rejected by receiving bank.


That's it folks, rant over. Waiting for the fallout tomorrow. But I suspect there won't be any, unless the central bank guys butt in. If you've made it this far, many thanks for reading!!!

Some notes:

The reply mail wasn't meant for the customer. It was sent to the complaint management executive. I hope some of the acrimony in that reply mail will get through him to the customer, and even if it doesn't, well, there's nothing I can do about it. They are a smartass, and they can deal with an annoying customer or two. Especially when said customer is deliberately trying to make life harder for us.

Banks do, in fact, accept Prepaid VISA debit cards as account number for transfer. But I know that the bank in question did not have any prepaid card product.

TL,DR: Customer issues electronic fund transfer with wrong information. Tries to make our life hard for their mistake.",1,1625692382

$ME:  Just want to clarify.  When you say label printer do you mean the large copier or are you talking about a tiny little printer.

$C1:  The label printer next to my desk.

$ME:  Do you mean the really big copier next to your desk? (I know the site well)

$C1:  Yes the label printer next to my desk.

$ME:  Ok I'm going to remote in to see what's going on.  I need you to go to this website and let me know when you're there.

$C1:  Do I click the internet icon?

$ME:  Pretend that you are going to check Facebook and type this web address in when you get there instead of typing facebook.com.  And tell me when you have gotten to the website.

$C1:  Oh ok.  

\---2 minutes of dead air--

$ME:  Did you get to the website?

$C1:  Yes.

$ME:  \*\*in my own head:  MOTHERF#(\*$(#!!!\*\*  type this code into the box and then click ""Download Application"".

$C1:  OK. 

\--2 more minutes of dead air--

$ME:  I see that it has downloaded.  I need you to click the application.  

$C1:  What application?

$ME:  The one you just downloaded.

$C1:  Where is it?  (she clicks the download app button a few more times.  I know cuz our program shows us when this happens).

$ME:  What browser are you using?

$C1:  Chrome.

$ME: it's at the bottom.  

$C1:  I don't see it.  

$ME:  have you ever downloaded a file or anything.

$C1:  Not on this PC.

$ME:  It's in your downloads folder.

$C1:  I don't know where that's at.

$ME:  Search your PC for xxx file name.

$C1:  How do I do that?

$ME:  Click the search bar at the bottom of the screen and search for xxx file.

$C1:  I always click at the top to search my computer (she's referencing google chrome's search function.)

This convo continues for an additional 6 minutes.  

$C1:  I'm going to get $C2

$C2:  Hey $ME!  

$ME:  Hey $C2 I need you to click \*\*while I'm saying this she's already clicked it\*\*.

&amp;#x200B;

So, the problem was that $C1 was clicking print sample instead of print label.  It took me 15 seconds to resolve the problem.  And 11 minutes to get the EU to figure out a way to click a damn button...

Just a note:  $C2 is older than $C1.  $C1 is a sweet lady, but for god sakes I have zero clue how she got hired to the job she is in.",1,1625692038
2532,The job that took a tad longer than planned,"Not mine but posting for a friend (with permission - his attitude is he's damned if he's reliving all this online for pleasure).  We'll call my friend Jim.  He worked for a company that made sales and purchasing software.  The software required an on site upgrade / complete new server.  These are all his attendances / attempted attendances at the company.  

Visit 1 to company 1 was something like December 2019.  He arrived with the new software for about 12 machines - to find an office still on Windows 7.  There was other proprietary software provided by company 2 which connected them to their biggest client (company 3) and spoke to Jim's old software. Jim's upgrade needs Windows 10.  Company 1's Manager had checked with Jim's company by email that the new software would run on Windows 7 and had been told yes (Oops).  Manager was OK, said they were working towards Windows 10 and hoped to have it sorted in about 3 months.

Visit 2 was planned for the day lockdown started (this was never going to be an installation visit - it was seeing what they could do to get more people working remotely in case there was a lockdown.  Cancelled.

Visit 3 - The first break in total lockdown - enough had been sorted that installation could take place at company 1.  So they thought.  Company 2's proprietary software simply would not talk to Jim's software as it did with the previous software.  Can they get a rep from the company 2 down here?  No - only one UK engineer and he's booked solid for a fortnight post total lockdown.  Managed to get old software working on a few laptops for home working and agreed to liase with company 2 and come back

Between visits 3 and 4, Company 2 went under due to Covid.  Everything is on hold.  Jim's company tries (but fails) to bid to be new software supplier for Company 3.  Enter company 4.  Company 4 work with Jim's company to make sure their programs don't clash - they don't (whew).  But for reasons Jim was never told, Company 1 decided to have company 4's software replaced before Jim's software was replaced.  

Visit 4 - turned up, case of Covid in office discoved 20 minutes ago.  Everyone sent home.

Visit 5 - over a year after visit 1 - the install.  The manager of company 1 comes up.  Lovely.  But where is the secondary on-site server as discussed in the additional requirements?  What?  This time the manager goes to check the revised requirements emails and it's HIS mistake.  Instead of discussing with Jim's company and company 4 - he discussed with two separate managers from company 4.  Embarressment but the requirement is now for an additional backup server.  An easy addition.

Visit 6 - there's no free network cable access for the additional server.

Visit 7 was in March 2020, about 16 months after visit 1...  Job complete.

The final irritation: Jim's new software was version... let us say 3.3.  Version 3.2 DID run on Windows 7 and could be server updated overnight without return visits.  He wanted to do this on visit 1.  His boss said no... (Yes, there may have been issues but probably would have been fixed in one month at most, all pre Covid)",1,1625691182

2534,The Joys of an Audit Trail,"On one system my team developed, I built functionality to optionally allow the auditing of data changes for any column in the database. This was built in response to a new requirement from the customer to audit changes to three columns in particular, but thinking ahead, it was obvious to me that this kind of audit trail could be very valuable *to us* in the future. So I built a more general-purpose auditing system, and used my own discretion to turn on auditing for any additional columns I judged could be an issue (which were many).

I am so glad I did, because anyone who's built a custom system like this, and worked support for it, knows how much some users like to blame ""the system"" for their own inability to do their jobs properly, and will take every opportunity to try to throw you under the bus for their own f\*ck ups. We got a lot of tickets from users where the audit trail saved our asses, but the user who really stood out was this one woman I'll call Janine. How this nitwit ended up managing projects worth tens of millions of dollars for a Fortune 500 company, I'll never know.

Here are some examples of the kinds of tickets we'd get from Janine. We got multiple tickets from her for each of these scenarios, and I could be wrong, but I don't think we ever got a ticket from her that was valid:

* ""Someone changed my data! I set field X to value A, but someone's changed it to B! I demand to know what's going on!"" Well, actually, Janine, you created the record with value B, and it hasn't been updated since.
* ""The system's changed my data! Field X was value B, but now it's value A, and no one on my team changed it! I demand to know why your crappy system changed my data!"" Looking in the audit trail, Janine, it appears that your team member, Q, made that change on Thursday at 10:07AM.
* ""Someone's changed my data! I set field Y to value C, but someone's changed it to D! I demand to know who changed it!"" Apparently, Janine, it was value Z, but you changed it to D yourself three weeks ago.
* ""My data changed, and I know you people did it! I demand to know why you people are changing my data!"" You're quite right, Janine, we did change your data. And here's ticket #5732 where you specifically directed us to make that change for you.

So the moral of the story is: always have an audit trail! It won't stop the idiots from complaining, but at least it'll keep them from having you burned at the stake.

Bonus Janine incident: To further illustrate just how truly stupid this woman was, one time she put in a ticket claiming that a specific field was missing from a screen in our app where she was viewing a particular record. Now mind you, this field was displayed in the same place on the page for every record in the system, and was never hidden. And using our system was an integral part of her job: she used it all day, every day, so it's not like the location of this field was something she was unfamiliar with. But OK, sometimes even a blind squirrel finds a nut, so I log into the system as her, open the record in question, and lo and behold the ""missing"" field is right there where it always is. Whatever. I close the ticket as invalid, with a comment that the field is there, and assign it back to the support liaison at the customer's site. The ticket got re-opened and assigned back to me *twice* with the continuing claim that the field was missing. I ended up having to take a screenshot of the page in the app showing her record and the supposedly missing field, with a big red rectangle around the field, a big red arrow pointing to it, and bold red text saying something like ""here it is"". That finally ended it. Jumpin' Jesus on a pogo stick.",1,1625682930

2536,You can't please everyone,"I run a small internal helpdesk that supports a few tools for customer service agents. Since we're customer service, we take our satisfaction ratings very seriously (and our ""customers"" are very understanding). With aggressive response time goals and strong follow-up on bad scores, our average satisfaction score has always been strong.

We've come close to achieving a perfect month before, but something always comes out of nowhere just to end our streak. Like a few months ago someone submitted a ticket to us for a tool we don't support. The other team won't let us transfer tickets or submit tickets on other's behalf, so we have no choice but to reject the ticket and redirect the customer. 1/5 stars.

Or more recently I saw a 3/5 score ticket with no agent assigned. Wait, how can you rate a ticket with no agent? The customer opened a ticket and then realized they forgot to include something. Since they couldn't find a way to edit the ticket, they cancelled it, opened a new one, then rated the cancelled ticket 3/5 stars...

This week we finally hit our streak. 30 days of perfect scores!",1,1625675065

2538,Sometimes the problem is that you overthink it,"So I just finished working at an IT helpdesk for my university, which means I have a few....interesting...stories. However, this was a pretty recent thing and definitely made me feel as much of an idiot as the poor woman I was helping. 

My uni gave out laptops for students at the beginning of the year due to remote learning. They are pretty decent and we had no real issues from students with them. This poor woman though called me at my desk to ask about her internal camera which she said hadn't worked all year. But! it was only ""not recognizing the face, but backgrounds on Teams showed up"", I immediately figured it was a hardware thing and asked her to drop by the desk in person with the laptop. 

You probably know where this is going, (please don't think me too dim).

I had a look at the settings etc to ensure it wasn't a software problem and then gave the machine itself a look over for any damage. At this point I was pretty confused as to what was going on. I messaged my supervisor to get the case notes as she said she had contacted us previously. While waiting for the response and wracking my very tired brain I brushed some fluff off the top of the screen and accidentally hit the lense cap over the webcame...

I felt very dim, and the poor lady felt even more embarrassed as she had not copped this over the past year. It really is the smallest stuff that ends up tripping me up.",1,1625664114

2541,"The toxic boss, the toxic workplace, and the gamble that turned it around","This is a number of years back now, but I used to manage the IT department in a small company that had a fairly niche product. From the outside, the business was great - well known in it's industry, they had picked up a number of massive long-term contracts, and business growth had been exponential.. Think around 1000% revenue growth, 600% employee growth, and we have gone from an 8am-4pm M-F business to 24x7 all in the course of about 4 or 5 years. 

Of course anybody who has worked in these sorts of businesses know that internally, they have either won the business lottery, or they are punching above their weight and hoping they can bluff their way through. We were the latter case. 

And so let's look back on our IT group.. At the start of my tenure, we were 2 (manager and helpdesk dude). And after these years of growth, we were still 2. But at least we had an increase in the IT budget to help build systems to support this growth, right? Lol. No. Actually one year my budget was reduced mid year to below our contractual running costs. 

The actual reason for all this varies over the years, but it comes back to the execs that I report to not particularly caring about IT, and administrative overheads impacting their bonus. ""It's running fine, you don't need more"" is a common theme.. The best one that I got was ""It's an insured risk, so we don't need to do anything else"".  The actual risk that was insured was paltry compared to the compounding impacts of the risk eventuating - but eh, easier to bury heads in the sand.

My last ditch effort to salvage IT humanity was to wind the service back so that we were no longer working 12+ hour days, and I was no longer taking calls on the weekend. To be honest, I was pretty well done at this point and was willing to take the gamble... That is - IT collapses and the business recognises that it's unsustainable and increases resourcing, or IT collapses and the IT manager finds a new job. It should come as no surprise that there were no additional incoming resources, and so I pulled the pin before it got pulled for me. In 4 weeks, I'm planning on kicking my feet up for 3 months before I even start looking for another job.

Now this is where the shit hits the fan.

**The shit:**

My boss didn't actually understand what my job was. Not surprising, because he didn't really care about IT. But because our relationship was fairly sour by this point, he wasn't going to entrust me with any part of my replacements recruitment. Between him, HR, and a recruiter, they built up a shiny new JD for the ideal IT Manager.  And they found someone who would take the job. Since they had a notice period, my boss and I were able to renegotiate the terms of my exit to cover the gap and provide a short handover. It was quite lucrative :)

**The fan:**

When my new colleague started, I had resolved to do my best to make him feel welcome and hand over gracefully. My boss and I had the beef, this dude was not involved. However after about a days worth of handover, he pulled me into a meeting room and had a frank conversation about the role. He didn't understand what I was handing over (i.e. it was too hand's-on technical), so he showed the job ad and JD. Of his 3 page JD, everything that was my job was encapsulated within 2 lines - support business operations, and drive cyber security improvements. All the other stuff in there wasn't fluff either - where I was really doing the work of about 2, he would be doing the work of 5-6... This guy was set up for failure, and we could both see it. My only advice was to ask the boss how the role would be resourced... 

A few days later, he confirmed that it wasn't going to be resourced.... That was his job and his alone. He was effectively employed to do an impossible job.

I did my best for our remaining time, and departed.

**The walls:**

It took about a month before I got a call from my my old helpdesk dude. Despite some very explicit instruction, their public ssl certs had expired, causing all external and extranet services to fall over. I suggested that he point the IT Manager to the documentation for it. About an hour later, and offer for hourly contract work showed up. lol. I had a fairly constant stream of work from my ex-employer over the next 2 months or so. I didn't mind, I was charging eye-watering rates, and as a contractor, I was all care and no responsibility. It was obvious that the new IT Manager was out of his depth and wouldn't be staying long. 

Around that time, I got a call from my old helpdesk dude asking me to be his reference - he was thinking of pulling the pin - the new IT Manager had turned into a tyrant and was taking stress out on him.. Not cool. Interestingly, I knew a senior person in the company he had applied for. I'm sure he would have done fine with the process himself, but I left nothing to chance. He obviously got the job.

About a week later, IT Manager pulled the pin, and as he hadn't passed probation yet, left with 2 days notice. My old boss had an effectively depopulated IT department, and got raked over the coals by the CEO for it.

**The aftermath:**

I did get a call from an old colleague a little while later to giver me an update on the goss.. They had found another IT manager based on a realistic JD, and had increased the IT team to 4. Apparently my old boss learnt a hard lesson about IT resourcing, and now that the IT guys have a better quality of life, everything is running smoothly again. I got paid extortionate contract rates to fund a 4 month break before my next role, and my old helpdesk dude got a better paying job with better career prospects. I'd call that a win for everyone.",1,1625628787
2542,"Looks like one of my users will get the ""monitor != computer"" talk tomorrow.","I work IT at a small medical practice. One of our receptionists was complaining that the scheduling software was being slow and doing strange things. I wasn't in my office at the time, but the receptionist found one of the administrative assistants, who suggested that she restart her PC. The assistant alerted me to the complaint, and I concurred that a reboot would probably solve it.

On my way out today, I stopped by the front desk, logged in as administrator, went to Task Manager, and found that the uptime was 4 days, 23 hours and counting. Obviously, it wasn't actually rebooted.

So, tomorrow, I'm going to ask her to show me how she restarts the computer. Perhaps she just didn't restart it because somebody showed up at the desk right after she got back, or perhaps I have encountered my first user who thinks that the monitor is the computer.

Me: “Thank you for calling —- tech support, how can I help you?” 

BB: F*CK YOU! YOU LYING SACK OF SH*T! YOU ARE GOING TO BUY ME A NEW PHONE!”

Oh, we are having that kind of day are we? Ok. I tried all the general deescalation tactics for well over half an hour before I finally got the dude to calm down enough to actually speak with me. (Believe it or not telling him I was from Texas is what did it. #facepalm.) After talking about how terrible the cow boys are, (I don’t even know how to play football.) dude opens up to me. So he got sugared into the store for a new phone. Guy had been way overdue for an upgrade. So the sales guy happens to sell him on the brand new iPhone 4! But what kind of salesman stops there? No sir. The deal isn’t done until you sell your soul. He also uphold him on EVERYTHING. The protection plan, the screen protector, phone case, EVERYTHING. This guy should receive salesman of the year award, because want to know how he sold him the phone case? He made it very clear how durable these cases are, by telling him “You could take a 12 gauge to this phone case and it wouldn’t break.” 
Sigh….
So BB takes his brand new iPhone and all his goodies and goes back to the backwoods to hang out with his buddies. He then proceeded to tell me about all the beer they were drinking and how we ruined his day. We….
After bragging about how strong the phone case is, his buddies are calling bullshit. So BB is ready to prove them wrong. He proceeds to take the shotgun out of his F250 tool box and show billy John how it’s done.

Needless to say, it’s pretty difficult to troubleshoot a phone in 30 pieces. So BB is now
1: stuck in a 2 year contract
2: has no coverage for intintial damage under his protection plan.

3: has no phone.

2546,Reading comprehension not required,"Hello TFTS! Long time reader, first time poster. I felt I needed to share this story, so that everyone can share in my pain. Put a TL;DR at the bottom. 

Our story starts with a freshly brewed cup of coffee from my wonderful personal coffee maker in my office. I like to enjoy coffee in the morning as it makes issues like the following slightly easier to bear. Before I get to even doctor my beverage, my cellphone text alert goes off. The message on it reads simply, “HELP”.  After working with my colleagues for a few years now, I know that trying to do a back and forth, or calling about the issue will only waste time. Their desk is only about 30 steps away from my office anyway. So once more into the breach I go. 
I arrive at said desk, and ask what is wrong. I can clearly see his monitor, and the current Phishing email training video on it. This following happens;
“Hey Aug, This training is broken. I have restarted it several times, but it keeps freezing on this screen! There isn’t a next button, and I don’t know what to do.”
As he is talking I look at the screen again and take stock of what is actually there. I see that it is at the section that states to “Click the icon above that represents your Email platform”. It has a few icons on it, for Outlook, Gmail, and 365. So I of course give him the benefit of the doubt, and say, 
“Oh ok let me see what is wrong.”
Here I take his mouse and click on the “Outlook” icon. It then goes onto the next part of the training. 
“Oh Aug! You fixed it! What did you do?” 
“I clicked on the icon it asked me too.”
“oh….”
I could tell he was a little ashamed, so I just reassured him and went on my way. 

Now a strange thing happens when I leave my office… people magically have been looking for me and need my help, like they can’t find my office, because of COURSE I have made it unplottable and told NO ONE about it. 
So I am inevitably flagged down the moment I turn away from the first desk. I momentarily contemplate ignoring said hail, and proceed back to my lair where my coffee is slowly losing heat.  I plaster on the customer service face and head over. You know where this is going….. same issue. 

It seems that there was a mass email sent out to remind people they still need to do this training. So there are bunches of people that are watching the video training and a bunch are getting stuck on the part where it literally tells them to click on the icon. I have to walk around to 5 different desks, one after the other. By desk 3, I have started looking at the screen, then just say “Have you READ what is says yet?” I swear I say it nicely. Or as nice as can feasibly by uttered while your eye is twitching. They then FINALLY look at the screen and READ it. Now it doesn’t even stop there. 

Later on, I was at another office that I admin, regaling a colleague that is somewhat tech savvy with this story. Having a good laugh at the fact that apparently our colleagues can’t read.  While we are chatting someone close by calls for him, as he is there “go too” when I’m not there. I am busy doing some updates and installs on a different computer, so I turn back to it and continue on. When I glance over at the pair and the computer between them, guess what I see… Quantum mechanics and the uses there in… of course not! Wishful thinking. It’s the fated training screen once again begging for the user to simply click on the icon to progress. The funny cartoon teacher seems to have lost it glimmer and the smile on the face looks about 1000x less genuine for some reason. Must have been a trick of the light. 
After he is told to click the icon, and colleague 1 is coming back over to me I ask if that was the EXACT issue we were just talking about, a bit more exasperated than I should have been. To which he throws up his hands and says, 
“I’m not throwing anyone under the bus!”
I chuckle, and say “Fair enough”. This does however make me wonder if the training was perhaps a bit too advanced for our users. I mean, there wasn’t pretty colors, or flashing lights accompanying the request or anything! 
TL;DR – Far too many people can’t follow directions on the screen to click an icon to finish a training video.",1,1625601358

2549,My grandmother's stories,"Hope this is OK, I met with my grandmother yesterday (quarantine is lifting) and she got to telling some stories about when she was working for our country's national bank. I'd like to share them with you all:

===================================

Following WWII, my grandmother moved to this country (somewhere in Europe), where she was put in a vocational school learning about computers (think early '60s). Their teachers were from the Army, who had experience with computers, but were horrible at English. At one point, the instructor said that if they input something wrong, they will cause the computer to dump, but he pronounced it ""dumb"". My grandmother says that for years they thought computers could switch to be smart or dumb depending on the input.

===================================

When my grandmother finished vocational school, she was sent to several places to interview, including the national bank. My grandmother knew that with zero practical experience and four kids, she was already playing at a disadvantage, so when the day for her interview came she went with the smallest miniskirt anyone had ever seen. There were four men with three-piece suits and her waiting for their interviews. The manager came out to the anteroom, picked her first, and she got the job. 

===================================

My grandmother was part of the bank's initial computing group, we're talking mainframes and terminals. She was learning as she went along, as was everyone else. She says it was not uncommon for them to be working, and suddenly someone would exclaim ""God, I'm such an idiot!"" or something along those lines. She says that 60 years ago computer programmers had supreme confidence in themselves, because who else would have the balls to tell an entire room of people they were an idiot?

===================================

After several years at the bank, and terminals became more widespread, my grandmother was asked to teach managers and their secretaries/personal assistants how to use them. During her lessons, the secretaries wouldn't write anything down because they were scared the managers would discover that they didn't know anything. The managers wouldn't wouldn't write anything down because they didn't want the secretaries to discover that they didn't know anything. This lasted two lessons until my grandmother told her own boss to split the classes, one for secretaries and one for managers.

===================================

The terminals they were working on had two modes: programming mode, where they were connected to the mainframe, and when they were disconnected, there were some games you could play. Whenever we went to visit her at work, the security guard would call her up to let her know we were coming, so she'd finish up what she was doing and logout. By the time we made it to her office, she'd be playing a game waiting for us (it was a LARGE building with slow elevators). I thought my grandmother had the coolest job in the world, she was getting paid to play computer games.

===================================

Those are all the stories she told me yesterday, hope you enjoyed them. I'll post again if she tells me more next time I meet her.",1,1625576292

Week one rolls around. Issues come up, but I do have experience so I muddle through. I occasionally have to text IT guy about small things but I'm handling it... until it's announced that a hurricane is coming our way (I'm in the Caribbean). SHIT! 

Manglement has a meeting, tell me to shut off everything (was already planning to do that) and they tell the users to unplug ALL their equipment and place any towers that are currently on the floor, on their desks. I'm not sure how putting a tower on your desk when you're on the second floor is going to save it, if anything water comes through your ceiling and takes the machine out anyway, but whatever, managlement will mangle.   


The storm blows through, lots of damage to property but the island mostly lives to see another day. It's the weekend so I go in on Saturday, bring all the servers back online, and wait for Monday. And here folks is where things get crazy. 

These are just a few of the problems I had to solve before 10am: 

1) My phone isn't working - Walk upstairs, plug network cable into phone  

2) My computer has no internet connection - Walk back upstairs, plug network cable into computer 

3) The printer isn't working - Walk upstairs again turn on the power switch for the printer 

4) My computer isn't powering on - Walk upstairs AGAIN - turn on the power switch for computer  
5) I can't hear anything from my phone! - Walk 5 mins to the warehouse to restart a phone after asking them to do it and they said that they had. (Users lie!)   
6) I can't log into my email - Walk upstairs - put in the password I just told her that I had set it to and she insisted wasn't working (New employee - maybe she's nervous, whatever)  


And the real problems:  
Two users can't get a network connection. Their ports under the desks are labeled so should be easy to find them on the switch, right? Well, true for the first user. Pulled her cable from the switch, stuffed it in a different port, phone lights up, at this point I don't care to know why it wasn't working, I don't even have access to log into the switches.   


The second User - I find her port on the punch-down block... it's empty. Oh boy. Maybe IT guy had to troubleshoot at some point, moved her connection, and didn't remember to relabel. This is going to hurt. Grab my tracer, dead battery. Scream that the warehouse has no batteries, boss runs across the street to the hardware store to get me one (I may or may not have threatened to quit whilst asking for a battery). After much struggling in a tight spot that ant-man would struggle in, I find her connection...leading to the empty port. Yes, her cable was punched into the port on the block that had no connection going to a switch...WTF!!!!!! 

Go back to the user's desk, crawl around under there looking for another port cause there has to be one, right? right? RIGHT?????? Nope. None. Asked the user if she was recently moved to that desk. Nope, been there months. Ask if she's sure that this is where her cable was connected. Yup, that's where she unplugged it from before the hurricane. WHAT?!  I even looked around under her neighbours' desks, maybe her cable was plugged under one of those with an extra port. Nope...everybody has only one. 

At this point, I'm cursing everyone who calls asking for my help (under my breath). I  find a patch cable, humour myself, and plug the fantom port into a switch, any switch. Guess what....phone lights up. WTF?! How was she even working?!!!! 

At this point, I stopped caring about how or why. It's now midday and I have had it so I leave for lunch.",1,1625569937
2551,Three for One-Half,"For once this one is fresh out of the oven, ready to go. Barely a week old! That said, it is rather short.

Cast:

Me: ¡Hola! ¡Me llamo Primes! ¡Estoy aquí!

LL: customer's landlord, cool guy.

PM: project manager.

POC: clueless point of contact.

Sup: my supervisor, still no tolerance for bull.

Tem: Temp who works with Sup and me often.

It started out fairly well, actually. The worst part of the morning was that I couldn't finish my Wawa breakfast sandwich because my appetite hadn't recovered from a recent head cold. Anyway, Sup, Tem, and I met up on a customer site to button up a simple job. The customer (a private college) had requested one category 6 cable each in two brand new dorm buildings to give network access to the building automation system.

Tem and I had installed these cables the previous week with minimal pain in half of the allocated time, but I only had a wiremap tester. The customer requested certification results, and sup had the certification tester.

45 minutes including waiting for campus safety, we had our passed test results and were loading up to go to our actual service call that day: decommissioning an office space.

Basically we were contracted to go in, grab almost everything that belonged to IT, box it up, and haul it to any nearby FedEx to be shipped back to the customer's home base. (The only thing we left behind was the printer/copier/fax machine.) We also needed to grab anything belonging to the ISP and take it to UPS to ship back to the ISP.

Tem and I arrived at the building at 9:00 and went inside to find the suite while waiting for Sup, who needed to stop for gas on the way. Once Sup arrived, we showed him what we had found.

A locked door with a ""will return at:"" sign indicating 10:00.

Ok. You can pay us to wait an hour.

We called the PM and informed them of the situation, and he agreed that we were on the clock and it was the customer's fault that there wasn't anyone there to receive us.

10:00 comes and goes with no one in sight. Sup calls POC. Voice-mail is full.

Here we go again…

At 10:45 we call the PM again. He gives us the number of the customer's IT help desk, but informs us that it's on the west coast, so they're probably not in yet. Give it 'till 11.

Once we call the customer's IT help desk, things start moving. We actually get an alternate number to call POC! One more phone call later and…

We are back to square effing one. POC is thoroughly confused, as she thought the decommissioning had been postponed. She told us to wait while she confirmed this was happening with her company. 

While she does that, Sup calls the PM and asks essentially the same question: you sure it's today? Yes, the PM has the email chain in front of him, and can confirm that POC was included in the emails.

It's about thirty minutes before POC calls us back. (For those who have lost track, it is currently 11:30, 2.5 hours on site, and 7.5 billable man-hours.) She did get confirmation that we were supposed to be there, but she's more than an hour's drive away and doesn't want to drive up to unlock a door for us.

She can, however, call the landlord to open the door, but warned us it might take twenty to twenty-five minutes.

(Sup advises Tem and me that we should go get lunch if we want to. Neither of us does. I use the time to type the first draft of ""This is the Job That Never Ends."")

Twenty minutes later, LL shows up and we must have done something right, because he has the keys to open the back door! Once inside we get to work tearing down every monitor, keyboard, mouse, dock, and phone we can find while Sup chats with the LL.

In fifteen minutes, we have all the workstations packed up and Sup joins us to disassemble the switches, router, modem, and cable boxes and pack them up.

Thirty minutes after the LL arrives, we are walking out with a cart full of equipment ready to be shipped out. It is now 12:30, 10.5 billable hours.

We load the equipment onto our vans and I eat the room temperature half of my breakfast sandwich while Sup searches for the nearest FedEx location. Fortunately, it's not far away, and it's even near our home base!

At 1300 we are walking into Wal-mart with two carts of equipment.

At 1330 we are walking out with several shipping receipts and no carts.

At this point, Sup dismissed me, saying that he would take care of the ISP equipment and bring Tem back to his car, as both were on his way home.

Not counting time spent shipping, we waited 3 hours for a half hour of work.

Does the title make sense now?

TL;DR: The title.

P.S. There's another story in the works, I just need to figure out how I want to tell the story.

I don’t actually have a budget for IT equipment, but I can pretty much buy what I need (and occasionally want) if I have reasonable justification for it, I just need the owner to sign off on it, and to be fair he rarely says no because he knows I do things on as small a cost as possible.

Everyday I need to print just over 100 pages to a printer at the other end of the office (only a handful of meters away) but as the printer has a maximum of 150 pages I need to check it’s got paper each time.  The young lady who works right next to the printer tells me to just ask her to check the paper level.

Asking to check the paper level each day gets boring, so I rename the printer ‘Kraken.’  Now instead of asking her to check the paper level I can ask her to ‘Ready the Kraken’ (we’re weird and it makes us smile).

Owner overhears us one day as I yell ‘Ready the Kraken.’

The owner has a good sense of humour and sends me an email: “I don’t remember signing off on a Kraken.  Please can you send me the initial outlay, running costs, and justification for a Kraken.  Please also remember to submit the VAT receipt for a Kraken.”",1,1625233992
2561,Signing out of machines,"There isn't a specific story to this, more of a general trend I've noticed. 
I do T1 phone support for the military. Mostly contractors, but some enlisted folks as well. These are supposed to be our best and brightest. Our defensive lines. 

And yetany of these people don't know how to sign out of a goddamn machine. 

In some of our troubleshooting measures, I'll ask them to do so. I shit you not, the only way most f them know how to 'sign out' is to restart the device. That takes too long for some things. Just...log out. 

I seriously have to walk these people though Start-&gt;Username-&gt;Sign Out. Granted that Won't doesn't make that button IMMEDIATELY obvious, but if you have any experience with electronics AT ALL then you should intuitively know that, when instructed to sign out of something, you look for some kind of a user menu. 

Maybe I expect too much. 

Maybe I'm just grumpy from a long night on little sleep.

And now that you're all caught up- 

This is the one that almost killed me. Maybe. Possibly. At the very least I considered it rude.

So this customer was a clothing store commonly found in American malls. They used a set of sensors above the doors that keep track of how many people enter the store. Employees aren't responsible for getting people in the store, just selling them crap once they are. So, employee metrics are based on how many people actually walk into their location. It's a good system! But those sensors are suspended from the ceiling and need to be powered and networked somehow.

Except they cheaped out, and bought sensors that weren't meant to be ceiling mounted. They had normal power cords, and couldn't be powered over their ethernet (networking) cable. Or so you'd think.

An ethernet cable has 4 pairs of twisted wires, orange, blue, green, and brown. You only need two pairs to make a 100mb/s connection, three for 1000mb/s, and one for what's called ""Power over Ethernet"" - which sends DC power down the brown pair, letting you run small network devices that support it. This was not one of those devices.

I was sent to troubleshoot these devices, and as there's a first time for everything- I wasn't aware of their ""Implementation Standard"", which was essentially a macgyvered power over ethernet system. If Jerry rigging electrical connections isn't enough of a pucker factor, imagine not being told anything about it. So I open what seems like a fairly normal biscuit jack, a plastic housing that contains female ethernet plugs with cables on the back. The wiring inside looks- weird. The jacks inside are wired to each other, but not 1-1, but I figure- hey, lets try easy stuff first. So I take out my punch tool, and go to re-punch each jack. It's a little spring loaded tool you press into the recesses in the jack- each recess holds and clips onto one of the wires in the ethernet cable. The spring suddenly releases after you compress it enough and PUNCHES the wiring back into place. With the sharp, metal, tip.

In a standard POE system this is never a problem. Except- in a standard POE system, only the brown pair is ever live, and is wired to a computerized system that uses very specific voltage and amperage limitations and multiple smart safeguards.

In this ""System"", both wires of the blue pair were positive, and both wires of the brown pair were negative, daisy chained to power one jack. Never before or since have I seen an ethernet cable adapted to an AC wall outlet.

So when I punch down the blue pair- I see a quite alarming quantity of sparks. This, I considered highly unusual. Tracing out the system, I start swearing as I see how it's wired. Dial up my remote support who knows all this.

""\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, level 1, this is \_\_\_ speaking, how may I help you?""  
""Yeah, this is Armwulf on ticket \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ for \_\_\_\_\_""  
""Logging out?""  
""Nope, I need level 2."" (Level 1 does the paperwork, level 2 provides advanced support. They have the documentation on what is where and why. If such documentation exists, at least.)  
""What for?""  
""Answers.""

I get forwarded, wait a few minutes-  
""This is \_\_\_\_\_\_."" (There were only about a dozen level 2's for the whole company. All of us subcontractors knew them on a first name basis. I'd still pick their voices out of a crowd these years later.)

""Did it bite you?""  
""Damn near, but I'm fine. Didn't feel comfortable proceeding without some info. You're telling me this is NORMAL?""  
""We told them it was a bad idea. But they have a contract with the manufacturer, so this is the implementation. There's an AC adapter in the wall outlet with two bare contact posts. Blue pair is on one, brown is on the other.""  
""And at the other end, let me guess, the blue and brown pair are spliced onto a the end of a cut power cable with electrical tape.""  
""Bingo.""  
""God that's stupid. If I plugged my fluke into that I'm sure it'd fry."" (Popular brand of cable testers. $600 model in this case, they can detect POE- but, that aint POE)  
""We've actually had that happen.""  
""You guys need a disclaimer or a warning on these tickets, it'll save us billing you for damaged equipment or technicians.""  
""I'll make another note of it.""

after that, we worked together to find the problem. Turns out something about their terrible wiring had shorted and the surge protector damaged itself when it popped. Because they can't even buy nice power strips. I used a multimeter to confirm there wasn't still a short between brown and blue, good to go- checked the output on the AC adapter in a new/spare power strip, matched it's regulation on the label. Wired everything back up and confirmed function. Charged extra for making me do electrical work. I'm a telecom tech not a sparky!

2565,It has to work! We already sold it and it's being loaded on the truck now.,"I'm going to use a fun analogy in place of equipment details  as my industry is very specialized.  I'm aware that I'm a stereotype and I don't care.  I am on a team of technicians who provide technical training and troubleshooting support to my company's dealerships nationwide and internationaly.  Through a mix of giving polite greetings to the wrong people and solving riddles nobody else could, I have become the nation's leading expert on a product we will call The Rings of Power.

A few years ago I was sitting at my desk minding my own business and doing absolutely nothing unexpected like the good hobbit I am.  Then Gandalf decides it's time for an F-ing dwarf rave.  Gandalf is the head of another department that does all of the custom design and sales for The Rings of Power.  He is very tall, always wears a hat, and is exceptionally competent at what he does.  He has a decent understanding of how the Rings of Power work, but doesn't know all of the technical subtleties.  However this was the day he decided to trust Saruman.  Apparently a customer wanted to mash two receivers into one system and control them from a single control panel which we will call The Lesser Rings and The One Ring which rules them all.  

I thought for a moment on this and determined that it would technically be possible, but it would be difficult to do as you would have switch a lot of files and transfer power all in a very specific order while waiting an unspecified amount of time between steps.  Otherwise there would be chaos everywhere and war would come to Middle Earth.  This whole process would have no diagnostics or confirmation that it actually worked until you turn everything back on again.  The Rings of Power simply weren't designed to work this way.  This maddening process was all so we could make the One Ring switch it's attention from one Lesser Ring to the other while making sure the unmonitored lesser ring didn't just start going crazy and attracting Dragons while it was unsupervised.  

I said ""For the love of the Valar, don't sell that monstrosity.""  Gandalf gets a funny look and says it's already been sold and is getting loaded onto the truck now.  After some internal screaming, I ask him which dealer gets to install the abomination.  To make the day even better, it's going to a guy we'll call Gloin.  He is about as patient and easy to anger as any dwarf in an elven dungeon.  At the very least he is competent with the technical stuff.  

I spend the rest of the day drawing up the diagrams for power switching relays and instructions for the whole switching process.  I document it, make physical copies, and generally try to make this as understandable as possible as I'm the only person outside of Celebrimbor, the original creator of the Rings of Power who can make this work.  I sent it all to Gloin so he can finish the installation.  This fix is pretty janky and is going to be a pain whenever troubleshooting time comes someday in the future.

As you can expect there were issues with the initial start up.  They had to move a single wire and then it worked perfectly.  (Ha! Made you suspect the worst.)  The down side was that I now had to spend a few hours about once a month running the owner through the complicated switching procedure.  My department isn't supposed to speak to end users at all but I'm the only person East of the sea and West of the Lonely Mountain who knows how this thing works.  This goes on for a few years before Sauron rises again and pitches the world into war.  The Lesser rings are no longer responding the One Ring.  

This didn't make a lot of sense as I had talked to the owner a few days before for another operation lesson.  It had still been working flawlessly.  Sure enough, the Ring of power wasn't able to bend it's full will on the lesser rings individually any more.  So I call up Gimli the son of Gloin to go check things out.  Gimli doesn't have the technical expertise of his father, but he is still fairly competent.  We end up finding a very important fuse was missing.  Not a bad fuse, a missing fuse.  It turns out the owner thought it was an extra and borrowed it to fix something else.  One fuse replacement later and The One Ring is back to Ruling them all.  

It's only a matter of time until the One Ring goes into Mt. Doom, blows up and kills us all, but that's not today.",1,1625177425

2567,Computer won't load Windows with DOCP enabled,"Hi all,

&amp;#x200B;

I've got a custom built PC here that won't load Windows with DOCP enabled. The RAM is going to 3600 as it's meant to. It does complete post. It starts to load Windows, but after the first loop when the dots go away, they don't come back to do their circles. There is an error that says some PCIe 4.0 devices may not work which makes sense, but I've had the same RAM before and it worked. Eventually the RAM had errors and after 3 times RMAing because of some bad returns (Thanks Corsair) I've finally got RAM that actually works without errors. But the new RAM won't boot to Windows with DOCP. 

&amp;#x200B;

The real question is, why isn't it working now when it was before? And what can I do to fix this? 

&amp;#x200B;

It definitely seems like it's just the M.2 SSD that failed since it doesn't actually stop the computer, and it keeps working until it stops sensing anything else to load and just holds there. I have updated my BIOS already to the most recent version. This is after this issue started so it's not a cause.

2568,When UPS Won't Deliver (Automation tale),"I work in automation in a machine shop, which means my users are mostly salty old blue collar dudes that hate computers.  This story is not really about their mistakes, but mine.  I had one machine that has internal PC based controls on it(runs off 24 volts), and every once in a while, the windows install would be corrupted.  I have good backups, so this is not a huge issues, but I come in an hour or 2 after production does, and higher ups get really upset with machine down time(I’m also the only one that actually knows how to restore it).  

I decide the solution is to install a UPS into the system.  I talk to my guy from the controls company who is super competent and he gives me an option for a battery based or capacitance based solution.  I know that the battery based solution will be forgotten until the battery explodes in the cabinet and does a tremendous amount of damage so I opt for the capacitor based solution.  This means it really only has enough juice to make sure the machine is shut down gracefully if there’s a power outage, or someone impatient shut the main breaker off too soon.  I plunk down 800 or so of the company’s hard earned money and in a few weeks I have a nice new shiny in my grubby little hands.

This is where everything starts to go poorly…I finally get 2 hours to install it(gotta get that product produced) and I pop it onto the DIN rail and boot the machine up.  The ups lights up and says charging…1%, 20 minutes later it says 5%, 2 hours later it says 35% and I pull it back out and put the machine back to production.  I call up my guy and we decide I should ship it to him for testing.  A week later I get an email with a video of it booting up perfectly after taking a whole 15 seconds to charge.  He can’t find a single fault with it and sends it back.

 I stare at it reproachfully on my desk for a few months hoping that maybe a stern talking to will solve all my problems, and finally there’s a few days break in the production schedule and I now have sufficient time to work on it.   I re-install the known good and working UPS give it a lecture on behavior and exactly what dumpster it will end up in should this malarky continue.  This fixes nothing…It blinks at me balefully charging 1 meager percent every 10 minutes or so.  I am this close to ripping my hair out in frustration, I try every stupid thing in the world I can think of spending almost a full day messing with this thing.  

Then I put my ear right up to it and hear a tiny click like a relay every time the display blinks at me.  I grabbed a multimeter and figured it out…See this pc is inside the operator control, and the 24v power supply is almost 100 feet of 18 gauge wire away.  Big capacitors grab big amps when they charge and the ups was pulling the 24v down to 21v, tripping it’s internal low voltage alarm.  The UPS was caught in a stupid loop going “Oh hey there’s 24v let me charge” to “OH NO! low voltage better not charge anymore”

The final solution was just to put a 10 amp 24v power supply in the operator panel, and as there was ample space and a 120v line already in there it took me longer to grab some tools than to install the stupid @#$@#$@# power supply.  After that it booted after about 15 seconds of charging, I configured it, tested it, and haven’t had to bother with it again.

TLDR: If you can’t deliver to UPS what it wants UPS can’t deliver to you.",1,1625166935

Right now in order to connect to the internet, you'll need to use an ethernet cable for now, or purchase either an internal PCIE Wifi card or a USB Wifi adapter.

PC: What do you mean it doesn't have wifi? It's 2018. I even read online that  90% of all computers sold all come with Wifi. You just sold me a defective computer.

Me: That may be true that a lot of systems nowadays are sold with wifi, it still means that there are some that don't come with wifi built in, which would mean your computer is in that 10%.

PC: *While explaining this, customer was trying to find more articles to prove his theory but only ended up debunking him further* Look, I just found another article that says 77%.  Building a computer without Wifi is like making a Pizza without dough. It's completely useless. Admit you sold me a defective PC

Me: There's nothing really defective about it as not having Wifi doesn't make it defective. Also, Wifi is not necessary for the PC to work as it's more of an add on topping like olives, which isn't required to be on a pizza.

2572,!!! Abandon hope all ye who enter this filesystem.,"I bet a non-zero number of you already have a good guess as to how this tale will end based on the title alone. But for those of you who don't, heed my warning and do not repeat my mistake.

So, like many offices, mine is a realm of those who have rejected corporate values by yielding to nasty emails or violent outbursts, or by perverting their human intellect to fraud or malice against their IT department. You know, the usual stuff. But one day my coworker, who we'll call Virgil, came to me with a very simple problem.

&gt; **Virgil:** YDAQ, can you show me a faster way to find the file I'm looking for in the shared drive?

&gt; **Me:** Sure thing, Virgil! Check this out. Aside from sorting everything by name, you can also start typing the name of the file you're looking for and it will automatically select it.

&gt; **Virgil:** Wow, that's great! Thank you!

But little did I realize the events I had set in motion...

A few days later there came a rumbling from deep within the bowels of the office. YDAQ, GET IN HERE.

Crap.

&gt; **Boss:** I hear you showed Virgil a fast way to find his files.

&gt; **Me:** You mean the typing thing? Yeah, super handy, isn't it?

&gt; **Boss:** Show me.

&gt; **Me:** *types a bit of a filename* Handy, right?

&gt; **Boss:** That's too complicated! Show me something easier so I can access my file faster! I want it at the top of the list!

&gt; **Me:** Well, uh, sometimes I'll put an exclamation mark at the front of a readme so it shows up at the top of the list. As long as you only need one file there it's pretty handy.

&gt; **Boss:** Do it.

&gt; **Me:** You... want *me* to? Okay...

And so I did. Boss was happy her file was at the top of the list. And all was well, for about three days...

&gt; **Virgil:** YDAQ, help! I can't find the file I need by typing anymore!

&gt; **Me:** Oh no, what happened?

&gt; **Virgil:** Everyone's started putting exclamation marks at the beginning of their filenames so they're at the top of the list! Look, this one's got five in front and three at the back! Damn it, Carol just added another one to hers and I dropped six places!

&gt; **Me:** Excuse me, I need to go cry in the restroom.

The exclamation marks spread across the shared drive like locusts through a wheat field. There was no stopping them until some paths ended up exceeding the 255 character limit and even then, it only stemmed the tide. The eventual ""solution"" was that only my boss was allowed to use exclamation marks outside her own folder, but there was no victory that day. I don't know what that company's folder structure looks like now, but I suspect my life is better for that fact.

2573,Tales from $MSP - Language Barriers,"Greetings TFTS! It's been a long time.

Much has changed in the land of $MSP, including parent companies selling us off to stay afloat, adjusting to working from home permanently thanks to the pandemic, but most importantly - I finally got promoted from Senior Helpdesk Guy to Applications Guy.

Gone are the days of rota patterns and taking phone calls from irate customers - now I do on-call rotas, and my interactions with irate customers are in Teams meetings instead, where I can \*see\* how angry they are!

But I digress. I was inspired to post this bite-sized tale when my wife noticed a peculiar Google search in my open tabs. I told her this story, and now I'm sharing it with you all. Enjoy!

\---------

""Hooray for set working hours,"" I think to myself, noting the time as 5.15pm and relishing the fact that there are fifteen minutes til I can finally escape the madness that is working Applications for $MSP. My kids are screaming at each other in the room beyond my home office, audible even over noise-cancelling headphones with the volume up loud, but there is little I can do to save $MrsOzy from their aural assault until I finish work.

I wasn't playing Fallout 4 for the umpteenth time - honest.

Anyway - I'm distracted from my ~~ghoul-slaying~~ hard work by the chime of the Teams ringtone. I look over at the Caller ID and note it as being $HelpdeskGuy, the new hire I'd trained as my own replacement. 

My eyes flick down to the clock below the prompt. 5.17pm. Damn it.

I swap my headsets over and answer his call, quite reluctantly. Now that I'm out of the Helpdesk for good, I suddenly understand why folks got cranky with me calling them just before they finish work for the day - far too often, you wind up working well past finishing time on something that could probably wait til morning.

""Ahoy hoy,"" I say into the mic, ""How's it going, $HelpdeskGuy?""

We small-talk for a bit - the usual complaints about the pandemic, isn't it crazy it's been *x* months since we've been in an office, et cetera, et cetera.

""Look man,"" $HelpdeskGuy says, clearly wanting to get off the phone, ""I'm sorry for calling you this close to finishing time, but I've got this really weird issue in Exchange that I can't figure out. Normally I'd call $ExchangeGuy but he's not on-call.""

I don't blame him. Exchange is not my strong suit - I can do bits and pieces, likely more than the average grunt, but $ExchangeGuy is a wizard. He's also my direct superior, but that's a different story.

""I mean, I'll see what I can do to help,"" I say, eyes flicking back to the clock again. 5.23pm. 

""So, I've got this user, who's complaining that his calendar permissions are all wrong. Folk seeing entries that they shouldn't, people who should see all details only seeing free/busy. He's given me a list of permission changes to make, but here's the thing - he doesn't have a calendar.""

I blink.

""What do you mean he doesn't have a calendar?"" I say, fearing the worst - profile corruption, some kind of weird bug with the user's mailbox perhaps? Worst of all, something that will take longer than seven minutes to fix?

""Well,"" says he, ""When I run the command to get calendar permissions, it tells me that the folder doesn't exist. But I've seen screenshots, and he definitely has a calendar. I can't figure it out.""

Screaming internally, I quickly jump into the Exchange server and fire up the management shell. $HelpdeskGuy kindly obliges when I ask him for the user's email address, and I run Get-MailboxFolderPermissions as I normally would.

&lt;UserA&gt;@$MSP.bin:\\Calendar does not exist.

""That's... really fuckin' weird,"" I mutter into the mic, ""Why doesn't this guy have a -""

And that's when I look at the email address again, and it clicks. That's not one of our UK users - that's a European user.

A quick Google search confirms my suspicions. I amend my Get-MailboxFolderPermissions command and boom - result.

""Got it,"" I say to $HelpdeskGuy, ""He does have a calendar, I've just got it when I run the command.""

""What? How?""

""Do me a favour - do a quick google search for ""[Dutch word for Calendar...](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-d&amp;q=dutch+word+for+calendar)""

There is a brief silence, followed by the faint tapping of a mechanical keyboard, followed by:

""You have got to be *fucking* kidding me...""

I look at the clock. 5:29pm, and the day is saved.

2574,Dang printers! If you keep hitting print It'll work eventually right? (another beer for work tale at my local market),"So My local market is great.  Great deli.. also a liquor store and all the stuff you need .. local vegies.  It's great.  I go in there and load up on some stuff .. check out.. and the owner (my buddy) comes in and says 'hey my printer won't print.. but it will copy..  I need to print out employee schedules bigtime .. what to have a look?' (no I really don't as I've got shit to do and FUCK PRINTERS but wtf right? he's a buddy)

SO I look on this epson multi function sucker which is showing an error 'out of paper', but he hits the 'copy' button which scans and copies whatever is on the scanner bed and it works.  Hmm.  I open up the paper tray door and notice his plant has a leaf stuck in it.. like when you close the door this plant is in the way so it's shoved in there.  I move the plant away a bit.. slam the door shut 

then 10000 of his print jobs come spitting out.. he's like OH NO.. so I get in the spool and kill most of them.

I'm like dude.. if it isn't printing don't keep sending it more print commands ;)

And move your goddam plant (which must have screwed up the sensor or something.. not sure, but after that it worked)

2575,Never go fully hipster,"In my company we have a special attitude to people buying non-typical equipment. Everyone is buying Latitude 5510 for work and you ordered a Lenovo Y540 ? Fine, but we'll keep an eye on you. You insisted on working on an OKI printer, instead of a traditional Brother? Don't expect service to be as smooth as usual, parts DO NEED to travel form across the world.

This one guy ordered a Lenovo Legion 5. With a GTX 1660Ti. For work. His explanation was ' I'm a trainer, I'm creating a lot of presentations in different programs,I need to have a powerful device, while stil being mobal as I tend to travel across the country. '

Fair enough. The laptop took one week to arrive, the basic configuration was simple. BUT. His programs took yet another week to install, as we have a very strict policy about licences, which btw. were over a decade old, the activation codes where stored somewhere on the manufacturer's server, and what's even worse - finding the installation files was a nightmare. Sadly, this is just the beginning.

Three months in, the customer complains that the thin plastic frame around the screen has cracked. He sends us in a picture, and there cleary is a crack. We have two options - either take his only tool for work away and send it to the manufacturer for a replacement, or order the part and repace it ourselves. He chose option number 2. That simple part, just a screen frame, took ONE MONTH to arrive. In the meantime, another crack appeared on the original frame.

Finally, I've got both the laptop and the frame on my desk. I start popping the damn thing off and realize it's glued to the screen itself. Obviously, this is yet another hindrance, but I manage to remove most of the glue and apply the new frame. Now, being a bit lazy, I decide not to glue the new piece in, as it might crack again in the future (or even better - the glue held it so tight, that some forces form slight bending the screen as you closed it - stubborn hinges - might have caused the initial crack).

Next day, the customer arrives. He is a very much pedantic man and would like to know everything about the repair. So I go on to explaining what I've done, and he rudely interrupts me with a 'Why on earth would somebody glued the bloody thing in? What a stupid idea!' and looked me in the eyes as if it was my fault. I immediately parry this with 'You see, this is not your typical business laptop. This device is ment to be used by gamers and normally gamers don't care much about tiny cracks on one piece of plastic, that they dont even notice"". That shuts him up for good. He takes his laptop, gives me a stare saying 'sorry to trouble you' and walks away.

Fast forward another two weeks and... There is a new crack. Now, I don't know much about material science, but this type of plastic must have been made to last very short and crack like leather exposed to sun for a long time. And guess who got politely told to bugger off with his non-important issue with the laptop?

TL;DR. Dude bought a gaming laptop for work and complained the parts and the repair weren't as fast and easy as on a business laptop.",1,1625117108

2577,Backups are important!,"Hi there.

Been lurking this subreddit for some time, so I have decided today to make my first post.

My background:   
I work in retail, 16 years and counting. I have the sole responsibility for the hardware/tech department (office equipment, laptops, monitors, printers etc) as well as returns and complaints. This might sound like a lot for some, but considering our store is in a town with ""only"" about 30k inhabitants I'm not drowning in work. I don't have any formal education related to computers, mostly been facing a problem and learning how to solve it as they show up.

This story takes place in 2012, so I have a few years of experience troubleshooting various PC problems.  
Enter stage left: female with a laptop-case on her shoulder, and a smile on her face.  
Center stage: Me with all the spotlights directly on me.  
Fleeing stage right: All my co-workers.

FC - Female customer

Me - yours truly.  


Me: Hi, welcome to &lt;storename&gt;, how can I help you?

FC: Hi, I've heard from a friend that you sell and computers?

Me: Yes we do, are you looking to buy one?

FC: Maybe, but I have my problem with my computer. Do you repair computers that are bought somewhere else?

Me: That depends on the problem, and wether or not your computer still have a valid warranty.

FC: Oh, it's more than 4 years old so I'm not so worried about that. I bought it from &lt;otherstore&gt; but they could only reinstall, and since I don't have any backups of personal files I can't do that. My friend also spoke very highly of you and how you solved their problem.

Me: Can you describe what problem you are experiencing?

FC: I can't log in. It worked fine yesterday but today it just won't work.

Me: Ok, we can atleast take a look and see if its a quick fix.

&amp;#x200B;

FC hands me the laptop, and I place it on the counter so we both see the screen. Press the power button and hear the fans start spinning, getting 1 bios beep and then see the brand logo light up on the screen. After 2-3 seconds it disappear, screen stays black longer than usual, and at this point I start to realize whats wrong. It's not a quick fix.

Me: have it always taken this long after showing the logo?

FC: No, normally it have brought up the log in screen after a few seconds. 

At this point I'm starting to suspect a corrupt windows install or HDD failure.

&amp;#x200B;

Me: Do you know if your computer installed any updates last time you used it?

FC: I turned it off last night, I didn't pay attention but it did take alot longer than usual to shut down.

Me: Ok, so I suspect there is one or more updates that have corrupted the windows install. The only thin I can try to do is the same as &lt;otherstore&gt; and reinstall.

&amp;#x200B;

Having said that, I looked up from the screen. Tears are streaming down her face.  
Now I don't know about you, but me - facing a crying woman - I did not know what to do or say.  
I just stood there looking at her, afraid to say anything or do something wrong.

FC: Is there absolutely nothing you can do?

Me: Based on my knowledge and the equipment I have\`right now, I'm afraid not. Based on your reaction I assume there is something really important on your computer?

FC: Yes, I have a lot of pictures and some documents. But most important is the research I've done on my family. 

Me: Genealogy? (&lt;- Google translate norwegian-&gt; english, hope it makes sense)

FC: Yes!

At this point I realize why she is so upset. My dad spent several years doing the same thing for our family, going back hundreds of years. Knowing how much work was connected with this kind of research, I couldn't let FC leave our store without atleast some hope of getting her files back. Especially since her friend (also a customer at our store) had sent her to me.

Me: what software did you use?

FC: &lt;softwarename&gt;

Me: I'm not familiar with that myself, but my dad uses the same software.  I tell you what, I don't have the neccessary tools here today. But if you want you can leave your laptop here, I'll log the service case as usual so you get your service reciept. Tomorrow I'll bring in tools from home, but I need yours and my managers go-ahead to use them. I'm fairly certain they might help atleast recover the files you need. I have used them successfully before on a friends laptop, as long the HDD in your laptop is working fine it should work.

FC: yes yes yes please do it, whatever it takes!

So I finish up the papework with FC and she leave the store. My manager passed us while FC was crying and asked me what was going on. After giving him the short version and asking if he was OK with me using personal tools on customers PC he said ""you don't need to ask me about that, do what it takes!""

I finish work, go home and check that my tools are actually working on my computer. Works fine.  
I call my dad, catch up a bit and tell him about FC, her laptop and the software she used. He could tell me the software used a database file stored on the HDD to store all the data from &lt;softwarename&gt;.

Nice, all set. Now I just need to figure out where that file is located and we're good. Right?  
I'm so glad Google exists, wouldn't be able to figure it out without it.

Next day, I arrive at work and immediately start working on FC's computer. I insert my tool - USB flashdrive with knoppix live - and press the power button. Same procedure as when FC dropped her laptop, all fine until screen is black again. Now I'm starting to sweat a little. 

Palm - meet forehead! I forgot to check the Boot priority in BIOS...  
Sure enough, USB is dead last on the list.

Having fixed that knoppix starts booting. Takes a while. I'm starting to sweat a little more. Screen goes black. Stays black for an unusual amount of time. I'm gonna need a new shirt soon.

Knoppix desktop finally decide to show up. I navigate to the point I can access the HDD contents, and double-click the HDD icon. 

All the folders show up, as far I can tell the HDD is working normally. I find the folder for &lt;softwarename&gt; and copy the entire folder to my USB drive. I also grab the documents and pictures folder as they are small enough to fit on my USB drive.

I turn off the PC, take the USB flash drive to my work desktop to verify the files are actually on the flash drive. They are.

After resetting the laptop with the built in factory reset, I reinstall &lt;softwarename&gt;, place the database file where it should be. Also put the Pictures and Documents folders where they belong. Call FC and tell her I'm done and for her to return to our store to pick up her laptop.

Not even 15 minutes later:

FC: Hi!

Me: \*turns around, sees FC\* Oh, hey. You got here fast!

FC: Yes, I couldn't wait!

I bring the laptop and let FC turn it on. Boots like it should, and automaticly logs in since I didn't set a password. From this point on I move away so I don't see whats on the screen.

Me: please try to upen your documents and pictures folder and verify it's all there.

After a few clicks FC can confirm her pictures and documents looks just like she is used to.

Me: excellent! please open &lt;softwarename&gt; and verify all the data is there.

After a few more clicks, I see her cover her mouth with her hands. Tears start streaming.  
She looks up from the screen.

FC: it's all there! OH MY GOD IT'S ALL THERE!

Me: are you sure?

FC: YES! COME HERE!

FC then grabs one of my arms, pulling me towards her and wraps her arms around me giving me a hug. Not wanting to make it awkward I hug her back. For a good 10-15 seconds she is crying, I'm getting emotional myself and there's 2 coworkers and some customers nearby wondering what the f### is going on.

FC: How much do I owe you?

Me: \*rough estimates calculations in my head\* Lets see, I spent about 2 hours total so lets say $50.

FC: \*staring at me\* are you serious? thats way to cheap! I'll pay double! I insist!

Me: Oh, thats very generous of you but.....

FC: Double it!

End of story: She did pay twice what I asked, and after finishing the paperwork and giving FC a crash course on how to use USB flash drives and online storage as backup she left the store.

TL;DR:  
windows wouldn't start, managed to recover files, reset windows and made a happy customer.",1,1625085552
2578,I Love the Smell of Hot Paper in the Morning,"I'm sitting in my office, pretending to do work, when a coworker stops by my office. They tell me that a long report has been printing on the main printer for a few minutes and isn't stopping. I take a look at the print queue, but the job's gone already, so we both head down to the printer to see what's up.

Sure enough, there's what amounts to a hot ream of paper sitting in the out tray, with more pages coming after it. I cancel the print (there’s a big button on the printer screen that says CANCEL JOB – this will be important for later) and I take a look at some of the printed papers. It's customer related charges (info that is usually secured), and there’s a lot of it. No one is coming out to claim their newly printed tree, so I begin the process of finding out who it the culprit was.

I ask a few of the offices around, but no one fesses up. I’m worried no one will at all, until I round the corner of our newest Program Manager’s office. He’s red, embarrassed red. I’m sure he could hear me asking down the hallway, getting closer and closer to him.

Me: “Hey, did you print something from the system?” I ask, pretending like I can’t feel the heat coming off of him.

Him: “Yeah…I printed it by accident.”

Me: “…okay…”

Him: “Yeah, and uh, I didn’t know how to cancel the job.”

I blink and in a few seconds of silence, I scream in my head: “You didn’t see the large CANCEL JOB button OR think to ask someone? You were just going to let 400 pages of quasi-confidential information print out for no reason?” 

Instead, I said, “Please let me know as soon as possible the next time something like this happens. The job can be cancelled right on the printer.”

He nodded, I dumped the stack of paper in the shredder bin on my way back to my office, and I mentally removed him from my ""People Who Have Two Brain Cells to Rub Together"" list.",1,1625084873
2579,Circular reasoning works because circular reasoning works because...,"Came across this gem today while trying to clean up some old tickets that have been lying around for far too long, and haven't stopped laughing about it yet. Figured it give everyone here a good laugh too.

User calls the service desk, reports having issues connecting to Citrix. Agent does standard troubleshooting, still not working, so it gets sent to Tier 2 for further assistance. Except, there is a key piece of information missing. *A very key piece.* Perhaps, the most important part of all - **the F$!%\*&amp;G name of the user!**

Now, our ticketing system is a hot piece of jank, so if you don't put the user's name in the correct spot, it defaults it to the agent who made the ticket (because reasons, I don't get nearly paid enough to make those decisions). So naturally, Tier 2 sent it right back, because they have no way of contacting the user having the issue, and to re-escalate with the correct information. Agent realized their mistake, updated the ticket properly, and the end-user got their help, right?

Come now, it wouldn't be a TFTS story if it ended there!

When the ticket comes back, *a different agent* picks it up, and ~~looked at the comments and reached out to the initial agent to add in the end-user's name~~ **immediately** sends the ticket back to Tier 2, without ever looking at the comments!

Luckily, I grabbed it the third time around, so we can get off this ride now. Well, except for the inevitable conversions those two agents are going to need about proper documentation. 

But those kinds of conversations require a special kind of drink, and I'm pretty thirsty right about now.",1,1625082273

2582,toys that interfere with the internet.,"it's been a while since I postet the last story. I actually wanted to make it a weekly thing, but let's just say I am too deep into the coding section as I am a bloody beginner and eager to learn. anyway, let's start with 2 short stories.

these are both not mine, but stories been told during training as an example of crazy ass things that can happen during the job. 

I am going to tell them the way they have been told us. So actually as short as possible, lol.

&amp;#x200B;

First story:

This story was told as an example of how vigerously we must search for possible devices that interfere with the functionality with the internet. 

some time ago before our training, in some part of my city, people called in routinously to tell the company their internet, TV, and home was either seriously slapped to the point of nearly dying or was dead already. the issue took place over several minutes a day, more often than once a day. nobody was able to find a fault.

it took some weeks, until our techs found an interference was distrubing the whole fricking area constantly. 

it took more weeks, even months, to close onto the culprit: it was a 20-something dude that was a regular gamer. With a microwave oven. next to his router. And he made food every now and then between raids, so he doesn't need to get into the kitchen.

In short, everytime this man took a raid break, he made himself some food from the ingredience of his mini fridge (that thing was a normal small fridge, that also stood dangerously close to the router, adding to the problem), threw into the microwave and zapping the signal in his whole neighbourhood and beyond.

he got slapped with a hefty fine from the company for the amount of work, compensations and some other fees. 

TL:DR: lazy gamer dude took a good part of a 400K large city off their entertainment.

&amp;#x200B;

Second story:

A bit like the above, but oh boy....

So, people calling in of their wireless stopping to work. After some time, it turns out, all the people calling in had their wify stopped **at the exact same time during the day.** So they had swarmed out some of our tech to check wth is going on.

And it is hard to say this, cause I am still in disbelief..... It was a drone. Yes. a drone. Not a bee, but those toys. for some reason, every day at the exact same time a drone flew buy. and the signal the drone got to be operated kicked the wifi into desubscribing function.

I really don't know if it's that bad, but if it was a long range drone, it's possible. And I think, if they followed the trail of malfunctioning wifi, they'd been able to get the person responsible dor this and slapped them with a fat sticker of fines, too. But I don't know the outcome of that.

they prolly got the tech a shotgun to get it down once and for all.

2583,The server of the damned (possibly NSFL for sysadmins).,"Basdically, this is a tale from the darker corners of the network. In the time when wiping a HD cost money, and you needed it done well..... 

Other ways were taught.... ways more powerfull, but heretical. 

It started with a server for the trainees, to run test things on. Within weeks, the server was filthy..... 

Then one person noticed how wouldn't it be real nice to set up a proper training equipment for the trainees, where they could be taught about raids and such? 

So,m the base setup that was agreed upon was to take two servers, One and two, and set them aside from the rest of the room. Take the most shit performing servers, and stack them up with old drives. Stack them up with old drives, because we had enough of those, and the resale value is shit anyways..... 

Next came the question, how to raid them? The answer was to let the trainees set this up, so they had something where if it burst on fire nobody would be surprised. 

Then came the idea. 

We have so many HD's that we pay good money to have professionally erased.... is there no better way to make sure the data can no longer be read? 

This is when this took a turn for the worse. Because you see, those Servers were formated as a massive raid 12. Two times a six raid, one on each server. One acting as a fallback of the other. 

YES, we went there. 

Now, what does it do now? 

well, when you have a HD that needs to be absolutely positively cleansed, it gets send there. The trainees will feed it into the array, and it will stay there untill it needs to be carried out. I have seen those drives. They don't even pass the sata check. They have been continuqal;ly running, being rewritten, untill the drive devellops a mechanical fault. 

The trainees use this as their personal server. Download podcasts, linux, steam library.... The more often the servers contents change, the better. And if there is the situation that we have too many HD's that need to be securely deleted..... 

They just Pull the oldest drive, put it at the bottom of the stack, slot in the new drive, and watch as the RAID begins to rebuild itself.

My boss has been away on sick leave for a while, and it was just extended further. As such, I delegated his approval tasks to myself so we could get the low-impact stuff moving. Part of that was approving people for access to this ancient ordering system. I approve the 30 pending requests and go on with my day.

Today I wake up to a few messages from the new people. No license available! Wait, what? Oh right. We're limited to 4000 licenses.

There is no way we have 4000 active users.

After digging up the database info, it turns out that we have licensed users that last logged on in 2011.

Is there any automated method of cleaning out licenses for offboarded users? No.

Is there any manual way that I can trigger? No.

Did anyone at any point create some way of handling user licenses? Adding/removing licenses in bulk? Anything at all?! No.

Oh, and is there a test or dev environment for the system? Also no.

After double checking that I still have the email from my boss giving me full authority to do whatever I deem necessary with this outdated system, and absolving me from any consequences if it breaks due to the lack of training in the system, I get to work.

SQL Update. All users with a license that have not started a session since 1/1/2020, remove license.

2912 records updated. 1088 users still have a license. Every user I know has logged on recently still has a license.

Servicedesk informed. No issues should arise, but if they do I'm to blame. Post-mortem sent to my boss and scrum master.

2587,"Thanks for the heart attack, I guess","I work at a large car dealership. It's 5:40PM, 30th June in Australia as I write this.

It's the end of the financial year, a very important time in the car industry.  Earlier I was trying to wrap my head around a weird problem with our wireless, while our admin clerks were furiously tapping away at their keyboards, trying to process the deals the branches have finally sent through after 5PM before end of financial year rollover of our system can be performed.  Outside, the wind and rain beat against the roof of our building. My boss had just left for some holiday time, I was the only sysadmin left in the building.

My train of thought was suddenly derailed as everything went black and I heard the contact breakers for the generator power panel thumping closed.  We'd lost power.  I was already hearing the plaintive cries of the admin team crying over the cubicle walls.

I've been in this situation before.   Thankfully, [due to another power incident years before,](https://old.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/axgd9p/sometimes_the_only_way_to_get_a_dr_budget_is_for/) the computer room and switches were powered from the generator.  Even though it was just after 5PM, a few of the staff with laptops around the group were still in the office. A bit of quick rewiring, and we had enough laptops going to keep the admin team busy while I tried to find the reason for the blackout.

A quick call to the local power utility gave me no clues, so I wandered over to the other side of the warehouse we call an office.  The other side of the warehouse is rented to a different car dealership, and the main transformer and plant room is located on this side.

I wandered over in the driving rain to see the other dealership manager hanging out of the door and having a smoke.  I asked him if he had lost power, he affirmed he had.  I told him the local power utility said there wasn't a problem in our area. He says to me ""Could it be something to do with those guys in the plant room?""

We were in the process of getting solar panels installed.  My boss was the project manager for this installation and kept me in the loop about the project, but he didn't tell me anyone was working tonight.  I walked into the plant room with the manager in tow to find two of the electricians elbow deep in the main switch cabinet.

I asked them what the (&amp;% they were doing.  They tell me they're preparing for the solar panels they are installing.  I asked them why the %#(&amp; they cut the power without telling us to receive a shrug and a verbal guarantee that the power would be back up in 20 minutes.  The manager asked them why the $*@) they cut the power without telling him, to receive a ""oh, sorry"".

I was thinking there was no way my boss would be that stupid to authorise a power cut on the most important night of the year, and called him to confirm.  He wasn't told about any sort of work being performed tonight, and said he was going to call the person in charge at their end and tear them a new @*$$%*(^.

Anyway, 30 mins later and the powers back up.  I'm sitting here typing this story backup and waiting to hear from the admin team about any potential database problems before they roll the system over.",1,1625040090

2589,Hard drives are HARD,"A little short story.

Working in a public school isn't the easiest IT gig. Budgets are tight, and there's quite a ""make do and mend"" and ""Don't fix what isn't broken"" attitude to IT procurement.

That ""make do and mend"" philosophy had me retrofitting SSD's into machines that were otherwise acceptably specced (3rd gen i5's, 4GB RAM, enough to work with). This left us with a stack of 3.5"" HDD's of various capacities, mainly 320GB and 500GB.

Well, time comes to clear out some space. The 320GB's are just a bit too small and slow to be of use, but the 500GB's probably still have some life on them. So we pull the several 320GB's off the shelf and go ham with the ""Data protection officer"", also known as a ball peen hammer.

&gt;""You call that a hammer? THIS is a hammer!""

Our site manager comes rolling along with his 6lb sledgehammer. despite the progress we're making beating the living crap out of these drives, site manager wants to show off his might.

&gt;The rep was fine. There is, however, an issue with the Website. The fields for routing number and account number turn off paste (ctrl-v), and instead require manually typing and then retyping the number. This serves no purpose, creates a security hole and actually makes it *more* likely that the customer will make a mistake. I keep my account numbers and routing numbers in a password vault. I tap on the entry, hit ctrl-C, click on the field and click ctrl-v. Net time, two seconds. Zero possibility of a mistake. At no point is the number visible to an observer. If ctrl-V is disabled, then I'm forced to make the account number visible *while* I'm looking at the form (a security hole in case my screen is visible to anybody else), then type it in manually (with a non-zero probability of a mistake), and then type it again (and if I make the same mistake twice, I've entered the wrong number). Turning off paste does *nothing* to increase security, but actually introduces security vulnerabilities, decreases data entry reliability, and greatly multiplies the time and effort to enter the information.

2595,Do you have a time machine?,"(Sorry I’ve been out of the group for so long, life happens, work happens and you realize it’s been weeks since your last post)

Backstory: I worked for a beer distributor for 9 years (not anymore). Here is a conversation with one of the on premise (bars, restaurants, taverns) supervisors. 

The players: 

Me (hey that’s me!) 

Sup (Supervisor) 

Ring!! 

Me: IT, this is bambam67

Sup: Hey B!! (He would never call me by my fist name, just my first initial. I think he thought that made us close friends. It did not)

Me: Hey Sup, how can I help you? 

Sup: Okay, you know how we are supposed to do a survey of beer signs and merchandise every time we go into an account? 

Me: Yes, you can’t start doing inventory or orders until you fill that out…or skip it leaving it blank. Are you having issues with the survey? 

Sup: Well, kind of…

Me: Are the surveys coming up correctly? 

Sup: Yes

Me: Does it move you over to inventory after? 

Sup: Yes…

Me: Then what’s going on? 

Sup: I took ‘salesman name here’ route this month…and I was also trying to do my job as well…

Me: And… (I knew this wasn’t going to be good)

Sup: I didn’t fill out any of the surveys for the month. 

Me: You skipped over the surveys?

Sup: Is there a way I can go back and fill in those surveys? 

Me: Unfortunately, I don’t think so. 

Sup: But there’s gotta be a way! 

Me: Look, every time you send in the EOD (end of day) that survey, along with the inventory and orders go to the server and is processed. The survey is sent to the Beer Company. They determine if we need more signs, more merch. GM gets a report each month. 

Sup: But you’re in IT, you have to know a way around this! I could get written up for not doing the surveys. I ride my team to do it every time. 

Me: Sup, the only way I know how to fix this is to build a time machine, go back a month and tell you directly to do the surveys and don’t cut corners. 

Sup: (quiet on the other end) 

Me: And no, I’m not building a time machine. 

Sup: Alright, I better go face the music. Are you sure we can’t do anything? 

Me: Positive. You better go talk to GM now and tell her what happened. It will go better if you tell her first instead of her finding out on her own. 

Sup: Okay, thanks for the advice.

Sup didn’t get written up. He did NOT take my advice and simply let fate take a crack at it. GM never noticed the empty reports for those accounts and Sup got away with not doing the job. This was not the first nor the last for him.

Mix of in person and phone support, and lots of other equipment besides a laptop - GPS, Blackberry, tablet, all in one printer, etc. So we needed people that could handle a mix of things. 

A standard interview was all day and involved time slots with several people besides the hiring manager. Of course HM gets the first slot in the morning.

SuperPorp comes in for his interview looking like the job is already his. We spend a few minutes making small talk then I ask one of my standard openers- What would you do if you encountered a problem that you didn't know how to solve? There's a few acceptable answers- Google, ask a colleague, check a forum, etc.

Not good ol SuperPorp though.  He is so well versed in all of these areas that a problem would NEVER come up that he wouldn't be able to solve on his own. I sat for a second and kind of rephrased the question to give him another chance. He basically repeated the ""never"" mantra.

2600,RV tech support,"TL;DR at bottom.

After working in IT for about a dozen years, I would occasionally do a little tech support. Mostly easy, but this one time...

So a relative of mine had moved into my area with her RV. She was staying in an RV park that was also a trailer park.

The spots came with cable TV and we went to the cable company to get internet from them.  They hand over a cable modem and away we go.

In the RV, there's an alcove with a TV. The alcove is wider than the TV and at the back is the wallplate. I unplug the TV from the wallplate and plug the modem in. Does not connect to the interwebs.

Get on the phone and got a great technician. Since this was a new RV and it had only been in 2 places that provided wi-fi for everyone before, I didn't know if the cables and connections worked, so I took the laptop outside and connected there. Did not work, so the tech did some stuff on his end and I fiddled with cables and detached and reattached.

Then I had to ask him to wait because a train was coming by. Okay, he says. Then hears how very very loud it is and is impressed. This RV park was pretty much on the train tracks. I have no idea how it's legal to be that close to the tracks. Looking at the map, there's 50 ft between the actual track and the first row of RVs. We were in the 2nd row.

So after we can hear ourselves think again, we manage to get the connection working. I say, okay, I'll see if it works inside again, but if not, it's not your problem, since it does work outside. He's pleased with me, I'm pleased with him, it was cool.

Go inside and of course it does not work. The RV did have a manual, but it wasn't actually for the right model. Looked online, nothing helpful, just some info that didn't make sense.

I was stuck. Lady goes to the local RV store the next day and asks them. The guy behind the counter says the same b.s. the manual says. I can't remember all the details, but it was nonsense. I mean, ""that's not how any of this works"" level nonsense about wi-fi not working unless you pay for additional services and stuff. Thankfully, another guy at the store has the real knowledge: there's a button on the wallplate that switches the connection between cable and the antenna.

I'd looked at the wallplate, but not with a strong flashlight. It was dark in that alcove and I did not see the black on black tiny button at the bottom of the wallplate.

The button was pressed and the internet flowed throughout the RV. Trains were still really loud, though.

If there's a moral to the story, I guess it's that when dealing with unfamiliar equipment, use bright enough lights to make sure there's not something wacky and/or tiny going on. I just now googled ""rv cable antenna switch"" and almost all the ones I found were white with a black button or black with a red button. I got the special one! I thought there was another connection from the tv to the antenna, but if I'd pulled the tv out and looked at the back, I would have seen that there was only one connection, which might have helped.

TL;DR: Trains are loud, RVs are weird, flashlights are helpful, documentation could be even more helpful if it were even in the vicinity of correct.",1,1624987456
2601,Hard drives are hard,"I've supported NAS products for many years, and occasionally you get hard drive failures.  This is 2 short stories.

First one takes place with a university.  They had a NAS at every site that stored a lot of geological research data.  One site seemed to be cursed.  The storage would often be sluggish, and it had a much higher rate of disk failure than all their other sites.  We even replaced the whole unit, but they kept on getting frequent failures.  We finally had them swap the unit at the remote site with one from their main office, and the failures continued to be at the remote site.  Something was going on at that site.

We got on a conference call with the remote site and the main office to discuss the issue further.  System was in a secure rack, this is their only storage, and they have always had a history of high disk failure at that site on all equipment.  Strange.  I discussed the issue with a friend that worked at IBM (this is back when IBM made hard drives).  He asked me ""at what elevation is the site, because most hard drives are rated for a max of 10,000 feet.""?  Turns out the site is at an observatory at the top of a volcano, and the elevation was well over 12,000 feet.  Hard drives need to ""breathe"", or at least the head needs to float on a cushion of air.  The thin air at the high elevation caused frequent head crashes.  Their only solution was to switch to very expensive (at the time) solid state storage.

Second story, different storage company, different customer, similar symptoms (also geological info).  A site had frequent disk failures, and the failures were only at that site - shipping the unit to a different site made the problems go away.  I got pulled into the case and I said ""ah ha, is the site at a high elevation?""  I was told ""no, it is at sea level"".  hmm, interesting.

We had them ship the unit to us and sent them a different, well burned-in unit.  We couldn't get theirs to fail, but our tested unit started crashing with disk errors within a week.  I was truly stumped.  The issue didn't happen all the time, but it was rather frequent.  I got on a long conference call with the customer home office and the site to fully discuss the issue.

A few hours into the call, the site said that they will have to disconnect because a storm was coming.  I started asking questions such as ""is this on a UPS, is auto-shutdown enabled, etc"".  They let me know that consistent power isn't an issue because the site runs off a generator that is rated for sensitive electronics.  They have to go and ""seal hatches and strap things down"".  Hatches?!?!

The NAS in question was on an oil exploration rig.  I learned that oil rigs float, and they rock with the sea when it gets choppy.  When they told me ""sea level"", they were 100% accurate.

I've learned that sometimes, it's best to get on the phone with the customer and not assume anything.  Even the smallest detail might be a clue into what the issue is.",1,1624985176

2605,The longest tech support call I ever took - by a large margin,"This happened many many many years ago. I did level 1 tech support for Earthlink for dialup customers for about a year. For the most part, most calls ended up with us setting up a new local area connection, or transferring them to billing because their account was suspended due to payment issues. There were usually around 200+  tech support people employed with high turnover, and I was usually in the Top 5 as far as metrics that they used to track us, mainly average call time. 

Here is the longest call. An 85 year old man called in trying to get the internet working so he could email his kids/grandkids. After verifying his account was still active, I proceeded to setup a new local area connection for him. On average this would usually take 6-7 minutes, but could be done in 3-4 if the caller was more tech savvy. 

The problems started from the very beginning. He had very poor vision, and he didn't know how to use the mouse. Every step I had to repeat to him slowly 10 times. At one point I told him to right-click on an icon, and he thought I was asking him to click with his right hand.

After about an hour my supervisor started listening in, which they did on occasion to audit us. Around hour mark 2 he walked by and patted me on the shoulder and apologized and laughed at the same time. Shortly after we finally got the connection setup. Usually this is where I could stop the call and tell him to hang up and then try to connect, but this guy was one of the 10% of people who actually had a second phone line installed in their house. If they had questions after getting connected we were supposed to answer them. We got connected and of course I had to tell him where his web browser was and where he could send his emails. 

In the end it was a 2 1/2 hour call compared to my average of around 6 minutes. Luckily it finished about 15 minutes before they closed for the night or that guy would have had to call someone else in the morning.",1,1624946326
2606,First IT Job - They never wanted to spend money on anything...,"So, my first non-internship IT role was the sole actual IT person for a small community clinic. The layout was like this: Main building had a 10Mbps/5Mbps connection. Office building had a dedicated fiber run from it to the main clinic building. Small satellite clinic had a dedicated T1 to the main clinic. 

One domain controller on the entire system. One. It was a pizza box system, because VMware was new and expensive (not really that expensive, but that's what they kept telling me). Server 2003 R2 (2008 was a new thing at the time). This was right about the time Windows Server 2000 SP4 went EOL. 

The issue? Slow login times at the satellite clinic. Five people worked in that clinic, and every morning, at logon, it would take the users anywhere from 15 -30 minutes to successfully log on to their systems. Continually received help desk tickets on the issue. Every time I went to test with the user who submitted the ticket, login time was long, but not 15 minutes, more like 5. Finally, I got fed up with it, and I put an old desktop computer in between the router and the switch at the remote clinic, running wireshark. Surely there was something amiss here....

Next morning, come in and check the logs. Well, that's weird... Why is SMB pushing a ton of traffic when they logon? Check the domain controller - Well that'd do it. Roaming profiles. Every morning, those users would login at the same time, and try to push MASSIVE amounts of user documents across that 1.5Mbps T1. Every morning, those users would call help desk ""It's taking forever to log in."" And every morning, I would work with a user, and the login time would be far less, because the system wasn't powered off, and therefore the profile would stay cached. 

Alright, go to my boss, who's the Director of Finance:

Me: Hey, Boss, I figured out why they take forever to log in every morning.

Boss: Yeah? What's that?

M: They're using Roaming Profiles

B: What's that?

M: \*sigh\* \*proceeds to explain roaming profiles in as close to an orange crayon method as I can\*

B: Ok, so what's the fix?

M: We either disable roaming profiles, or they need a local domain controller. We should have two anyway just in case something goes awry with one or the other.

B: We don't have money for that, and we can't disable their profiles being backed up to the server. What else you got. 

M: A lot of unhappy users, that's what we've got. I'll explain what's wrong to them, and then you can explain why we can't fix it.

B: Can't you just do it? You're the IT guy. 

M: Sure, but I'm going to tell them who told me we couldn't fix it.

Next step: Go to her boss, the clinic director. That conversation goes as well as the previous one. Same response: No money, and we can't change settings.

Ok, so back to the drawing board....

Go to our Boneyard (a room in the basement of the Office building where we store old, washed up PC's before they get recycled.) Find an old PC with a half-way usable processor. It's an AMD Athlon XP 3200. Bioware motherboard with four memory slots. Manage to dig up 4 2GB DDR DIMM's (yes, they were old then. Ancient now.) Dig around and find four 250GB 5200RPM 3.5"" hard drives. Motherboard has SATA on it, and a built in RAID controller (life saver). Set up the four drives in RAID 5. Continue digging, trying to find a Server 2003 license. Unable to locate. Find Server 2000 SP4. Screw it. Install that. Promote to DC, replicate remote user's profiles to it, change their targets. Take the server to the remote site, install it.

Call from that site the next day:

User: Oh, wow! You fixed it! It took almost no time to log in today! Thank you so much!

M: You're welcome. Let us know if you have any more issues with it, ok?

U: Will do!

Call boss:

M: I fixed the satellite office.

B: How? 

M: Using old equipment that should've been recycled years ago. It's a band-aid fix. We need to have a new server in the budget, period. 

B: I'll forward your request on to Big Boss

Budget time rolls around: No server. Justification? ""It's working now, so why do we need it?""

Left that place within a month after that.

2608,"""Is that burning smell normal?""","This happened back when desktop monitors were CRTs and LCDs were limited to laptops &lt;=13"" because the corners were already exceeding the maximum viewing angle.

A coworker and I were doing a lot of PC installs that quarter and this was maybe the dozenth site we had done. Most of it was just physically removing the W98 era PCs, setting each user up with all new everything, install printers, and make sure they could login. Simple stuff, on-site for less than an hour.

We're at a smaller site, I think it had a whole 4 users that were getting new PCs that day, 2 in one room and 2 more in an adjacent. The first 2 were finished and users were back to work. We're in the next room working on the second pair when one of the user from the first room calls out to us. Like most of the users at these sites, she's an older women who was likely a few years from retirement, also courteous and grateful for the new equipment.

{USER}: ""Is that burning smell normal?"" she asked in a completely calm and innocent tone, as if was something like the desktop being a slightly different shade of blue.

Both of us in unison: ""No! No, burring smell is not normal!""

We can't see her or the computer, but we can smell it too. One of us goes for the fire extinguisher and the other jumps back to the other room to see what we're dealing with. The new-out-of-box Compaq monitor was faintly smoking from an internal high voltage arc. Unplugging the thing was all it took to stop the incident.

Since we we had other sites to do that day, we had another monitor to swap with back in the truck.

Supervisor-AssHat wasn't too happy since instead of hitting the other sites, we came back to the main office early to get another monitor and leave the toasted one with him, and he had to update the asset tracking changes for both, then also had an RMA to deal with.

For the rest of that PO batch, we started taking an extras, which was a good idea as we ended up with a few more DOAs in the following weeks. That final era of Compaqs before the HP buyout were garbage.

&gt; $Manager - Sorting emails by conversation, or show as conversation, has been a security mandate in *our company* since 2016. IT has mandated this since before I started here. Can you confirm this for me?  

It is at this moment I realized he was not talking to me, but talking down to $User loudly so I could hear it.  

&gt; $Me - Im sorry were you talking to me or $User?  
&gt; $user - He was talking to me.   
&gt; $Manager - well both of you. I need you to confirm that this is a security measure. 

Teams message comes in from him. ""Just agree to it."" Well my sound was muted so no ding came over the phone. I didnt actually click on the message so the eyeball did not appear on his side in teams. 

&gt; $Me - No its not. Thats ridiculous. Password, 2FA, *security program* and *A/V Firewall program* are the only security measures for email. Well... only ones for client side. Server side has significantly more.   
&gt; $Manager - So... its not a security requirement?  
&gt; $Me - Nope. In face we recommend against Show as Conversation as it leads to confusion.   

Teams popup ""Is this the same $Me I have on the phone?"" 

&gt; $User - So we don't have to use it?  
&gt; $Me - Well IT doesnt mandate it for security purposes. I cant speak to your direct supervisor's policies. 

I waited an hour before replying on teams on my phone. ""Apologies. I guess Teams crashed in citrix before you called. I did not see these popups until I checked my cell phone just now."" He didnt reply.",1,1624905236

2614,User needs “a new email address”,"Short one:

Had a comment on our Outlook page saying “I couldn’t find out how to get a new email address”

Ended up reaching out to the user and their reply was I need newgeneric.shared@company email address, but also need a personal one. 

As the form is a bit fiddly for exact email requests (got a ton of shared mailboxes that are office.office team rather than office.team) I ended up submitting it for them to approve.

Then got on to the second part of the user needing a personal one (bearing in mind I was contacting them on name@company)

After some questions user just said they need to keep the one they have.

Realised they took the “you only can have 1 email address” a bit too literally.


User called me a saviour for getting them sorted and we add 1 more shared mailbox to the list we need to license.

Tldr: user thinks requesting a bee shared mailbox will delete their personal account.",1,1624886020

2616,Please don't literally punch in...,"Short background: I work a non-IT office position in a retail chain where I am relegated tech issues which I either resolve on my own with basic troubleshooting (definition varies) or enlist support from the help desk. This is a tale from my old store last year.

Our time clock was scheduled for an upgrade in the coming months, and it was needed because one button had partially sunken into the casing and had to be pressed 'just right' to actuate, and this number happened to be part of everyone's ID. Because of the scheduled upgrade and a shortage of replacements at the time due to *worldwide things*, we had to make do with this until the new one arrived.

I came in to work one Sunday morning, an hour before everyone else to help with the overnight transition, and went to punch in, except... The button was completely sunken in and wouldn't activate. Of course this happened on a Sunday, and of course it also happens to be the end of a biweekly pay period! There is another way for associates to punch in and out but it involves a computer (gasp) and it would take an entire day to both train associates to do it and convince them that it's in their best interest instead of filling out a paper that I have to come back that night to key in manually. I've done that before after a system outage (also on a Sunday at the end of a biweekly pay period hahaHAhA) and it takes about an hour to do 50.

There was one hour before associates started arriving for work, 45 minutes for the earlybirds, and I decided to try to fix it myself. It's already working zero percent so I can't really make it any worse, although in hindsight maybe we could have escalated a ticket for replacement in this condition; I would just have to deal with one day's worth of papers. What can I say, I was young and reckless and panicked instead of considering all my options. I took the thing off the wall (unplug and lift up) and took it back to my office to open it up on the counter (grab socket screw with fingers and pull). I can see where the real button and plastic are supposed to be, and where they actually are, and they are not the same. I also know that helpful mechanical engineer's flowchart about what to do when things move when they aren't supposed to, and grabbed a roll of electrical tape from a nearby drawer. The circuit board was screwed down pretty intricately and I couldn't completely remove it; best I could do was lift one side and try to get some rolled up electrical tape in position with a screwdriver and press it back down.

While doing this, I'm also repeatedly stepping away to touch a large metal object just in case some staticky shenanigans happen. My office shocked me, a lot, enough that I developed a fear response and had to will myself through it in years prior. Thankfully a new manager had recently transferred and whatever poltergeist I had on me jumped to him, and the shocks stopped. He needs therapy, though. I don't know if static discharge would damage this time clock but I didn't want to find out the hard way so I kept touching largemetalobject just in case. 

The surgery was a success and the timeclock went back up on the wall before anyone else had even arrived, with a note for associates to press the buttons gently. My workmanship must have been pretty good because it stayed functional until the new model came in a month later!",1,1624823983

Chad:OK

Op:unfortunately we don't have that information (its true) 

This goes on and on until he just gave up without us even to start anything, I just provided him our feedback page went on with my day.

Then my mind created a freaking list of tips for tech support
Or this is just me ranting, hope people with the same situation can find it funny or useful.

Tips when speaking to a tech support

1.We don't appreciate the question ""now what?""

The f*ck you want to hear? Is your ass going some where? 

Freaking appreciate the time that we need when we're analyzing your problem and thinking of two steps ahead in getting your ass unscrewed.
this question will freaking trigger us and this results us to battling with our conscience if we get to decide to screw your device even more.

2.Avoid ""Hello??"" 

Again are you in a fu**ng hurry? if you are then don't waste our time scrambling for answers for your problems that we don't have details yet because of your so called ""lack of time"".

We absolutely can hear you, but we're simply wracking our brains due to the pathetic piece of information you've given.

There's a living human on the other end, We're not fortune tellers.

3.Definitely avoid saying ""so you can't do anything?""

Again, we're only human not a wizard/magician or even jesus christ.
You f**kng need to accept the results, it is what is and move on, you want to complain? go find the company website and don't bother us.

4.When we want you to try something, don't argue and say it's ""inconvenient"", why even bother calling for help if you don't want it? Simply get back when you're ready to have your problems fixed otherwise you're only wasting our time.",1,1624782799
2621,I need READ-ONLY SSH ACCESS to the admin user!,"So I support middleware infra in a pre-DevOps support model at an enterprise-scale corporation. We have automation that manages application teams' SSH and web console access for prod app servers (as one reasonably should!), such that their RSA keys are only present on the server during scheduled change windows and they can't just hop on whenever they want and mess around with things they shouldn't.

We've recently onboarded a new team to this service, where previously they had managed their own app servers. I've shown them how to use our access automation and set them up with everything they need to succeed.

Or so I thought.

This last week, one of their engineers opens a request to give them ""read-only access to the prod servers."" I initially take this to mean read-only access to the app server web console, which I confirm has already been done. So I ask him to clarify what he means by this—maybe he's having trouble getting into the console or something and I can give him some documentation to help him out.

No, he hasbread-only access to the web console just fine. He wants read-only access to the *admin UserID.* On Linux. He insists that they had this kind of access control on their old servers and it's not working on the new server. I explain why this isn't how UserID's work, and suggest that maybe what he's looking for is to add a separate service account to these servers for his team and set permissions on all relevant directories so that that UserID can read them.

Nope, that's not what he wants. He wants read-only access to the admin UserID. He wants all of his teammates to be able to log into *that* UserID whenever they want, and have read-only access to all files for that application server. He insists that he has logged into the server with the admin UserID and had permission denied errors for files that the admin UserID owns (and in fact *writes to*), and he needs the admin UserID to be given read-only access to those files, for all of his teammates.

At this point I've given up explaining that this is not how Unix UserID's work (and am feeling honestly a bit uneasy about the fact that this is an engineer who is responsible for installing and managing prod upgrades to their app server) so I decided to change tracks. 

""Okay, can you please show me a screenshot of when this issue last occurred or give me the path of the files you believe the admin user doesn't have access to?""

Now, I have no reason to believe the admin user is missing any of the required accesses. My team builds out all the directories in a contained directory structure owned by the admin user, and we have pretty strict access management controls in place. The intent here is to get him to show me how he came to the faulty conclusion to begin with, of course.

His response is ""Sure, I'm a bit busy but I'll show you later.""

It's been a few days now and I haven't heard back yet. Not holding my breath for a satisfying conclusion on this, because usually what will happen with these things is that he'll do a bit of reading or consulting with his senior teammates and figure out on his own that the issue he's running into is something completely unrelated. 

But admittedly a part of me is actually kinda invested now in finding out exactly what the actual issue is that this guy has misconstrued as ""we need read only access to the admin Linux UserID.""",1,1624743274

2623,The Reply All Heard Round The World,"Someone recommended I post this to Reddit so here we go. About 5 years ago I was working as a supervisor at a major ISP in America. Our HQ had just hired a new executive who was trying to schedule a meeting invite BCC for a *company name HQ* Dist list. However, in his infinite wisdom, he misspelled the dist list to *company name all*.

At first it was quiet. Our center started chatting about it and a few of us sups went to check on our agents. Sure enough everyone in the office was invited to this meeting. I call up our NOC and say “hey we got a strange email from Hq, it looks like it was Bcc’d to the wrong district, just a heads up we may need to spin up some additional servers.”

I get off the call and head back to my office when I see the first reply. “Hi, please take me off this list”. I check a few desks and confirm it was a reply all.  That’s when it began. At first it was the auto replies. Then came the “me toos”. Over the horizon a large wall of “OMG” and “I can’t work stop replying” hit. At this point our NOC is in full panic mode. We had over 115,000 employees at that time and every single one could reply all.

 We were getting 1000 responses a minute. Our task management system went to crap because it couldn’t deliver responses via email. SLAs went to hell in a hand basket. Our company couldn’t function basically. Sure the front line could work but everyone else who relied on emails was essentially cutoff. It died down after 7 hours and we thought everything would be ok.

Then an international employee responds: “hey what’s going on I have a lot of emails”. Every. Single. Employee. Responded. Saying. Don’t. Reply. All.

From what I understand they had to spin up a bunch of VMs just to host temp databases to store all this garbage. It lasted 3 days of hell before everyone got it out of their system. I still shudder to think that people handling more money than I see in a life time or capable of doing this.",1,1624676964
2624,Opening your mouth just means getting more work,"I've been asked to take over someone I'll call Sue who is going on an extended leave. About 2 months probably. And she may not come back.

While she's out others on our team will cover for her. I was given the report creation duties.

Last week we met and reviewed her process. The first 10 minutes was spent in confusion by me asking her which tables she queried, what criteria she used, what time she kicked off the query, etc etc.

She doesn't do anything like that:  
1) She watches for emails that have a certain phrase in the subject line.  
2) She tracks the ticket number listed in those emails via a spreadsheet she keeps open all day.  
3) At a certain time every day she grabs the list of tickets from the spreadsheet and opens our ticketing application.  
4) She browses to each ticket and verifies the information is still current.  
5) She copies and pastes the information from various sections of the ticket into an email.  
6) Repeat steps 4 &amp; 5 for each ticket.  
7) She formats the information and adds some boilerplate language for each ticket in the email.  
8) She sends the email to a coworker he manually reviews it for errors.  
9) She sends the result to our manager who gives it a brief onceover and then sends it to the CEO of our fortune 500 company. 

She also includes a few charts/tables she gets by running a couple queries, but 90% of the time/effort is in the manual tracking/review/copy/pasting.

I listened to Sue for the first 10 minutes of her explanation before deciding I wanted nothing to do with this. I'm a little embarrassed that I ignored her the rest of the meeting and instead focused on developing my own method. I couldn't do this before working from home and one day it will get me into trouble.

Anyway, I created a report that will capture all of the relevant information, filtered by a few things that will pick out the relevant tickets. 

The report results are then fed into a template that formats and presents all of the ticket details. All I have to do is copy and paste the result into the email and convert it from table to text. Creating this took about an afternoon.

My process from when I run my query until I'm ready to send is about 10 minutes, including all charts/tables/etc. I think my coworker was spending 2 hours a day on this. At least. And my process is a lot less fallible. So far our coworker has found no errors in my results, only little formatting nits that I corrected in the template. Our coworker's review probably adds another 30 minutes.

Today a colleague and I had this exchange. 

**Dave**: I cannot believe that someone in our company was using such an absurd report generation process. Especially for something that goes to the top. It still blows my mind.

**Stan**: Dave, you know that group is infamous for this sort of things. Or should I say *your* group.

**Dave**: Don't lump me with the rest of the people here. You know we had that reorg. This has only been ""my"" group for a few months.

**Stan**: Whatever. So what did Sue say when you showed her the report and the template?

**Dave**: I haven't showed it to her yet. We both report to Chuck now. It occurred to me that she will probably show it to him and if she does he will become aware that what took her 2 hours now takes me 10 minutes. I think he will simply cheerfully send me more work. I've never done this before, but I'm thinking of keeping this to myself and telling no one.

**Stan**: Dave, the real tragedy is that it took you 25 years to figure that out. Always, *always* keep your mouth shut.",1,1624675477

Other tech: Thanks for joining, saint\_of\_thieves. We're finding that there are over 200,000 files in the \\out folder.  
Me: Oh! Okay. Well, let's check that out. &lt;I start looking through the files&gt; So, it looks like these files date back as far as 2019.  And just spot checking a few of these, I see that they're intended for a destination called &lt;third party&gt;.   
Customer: We stopped using &lt;third party&gt; three years ago. Why are these files still here?  
Me: Well, the most recent date is from today. You've been trying to send these files since 2019 until today. What happens is that our software will write the file to the \\out folder and then send it over the socket. If the other side of the interface isn't accepting  the connection for whatever reason, we'll report an error and the file will just stay in \\out. If they'd been sent over the socket, we'd put &lt;pulls up the interface settings&gt; our copy of the file in this archive folder you have specified here. I notice that the interface is turned off on your side. When did you turn this off?  
Customer: Oh, we were troubleshooting something earlier today and turned it off then. But we haven't used &lt;third party&gt; for three years. Why are the files here?  
Me: Because you've had the interface running all this time. You may have stopped using that company but you never told the software to stop trying to send files. And it's been failing to send for three years. It looks like whoever is supposed to be monitoring the activity and error logs have been ignoring this for years. This would have been logged in the same place where you would correct other errors like files that came in but couldn't find the correct patient. Those errors are normally resolved on a daily basis. And these connection errors would be seen then.  
Customer: So, what do we do with these files?  
Me: You can delete them. You haven't wanted to send them for 3 years, so there's no reason to keep them. And now that your side of the interface is turned off, you shouldn't see any more being created.",1,1624671066

2630,Security Camera displays in HPSmart??,"Background: We are a Managed Services organization that takes care of our clients IT needs by providing and implementing solutions for them. We have a client that has Security Cameras and they use HP Copiers. 

Story: I got a call saying that one of the users weren't able to print and sent photos of HP Smart giving errors. I remote into OP machine and started off with simple print test page and... it went through. I tested through chrome with a online test pdf page and that went through. I tried it through edge which is what OP was using and that worked as well. 

It didn't make sense because I was able to do this both from Edge, Chrome, Adobe and even download a local PDF document and still sent right on through. 

I went ahead and looked in HP Smart to see if there was anything noticeable there which it was giving us an error notice the whole time. I went into settings and advanced settings to see what might be in there and to my surprise a Security camera popped up, ON HP SMART?! I was even able to sign in with Zero issues lol. I thought it was an IP issue which I checked both the camera and the Copier and both were two completely different IPs.

If anyone doesn't know with HP Smart when you click advanced settings it generally takes you to the web page for that said device inside the HP Smart app. Somehow that Copier either was at that IP of the camera then was moved and now it thinks the IP is still the same, not entirely sure.

I ended up telling OP that if you use HP Smart you'll most likely have issues but if you print as you normally do you should be ok. Of course if they run into problems again we will take care of them but I didn't see the need in fixing something that had zero issues while on the phone. 

I'm not entirely sure as to why this happened so any ideas would be fun. Also who hates HP Smart?",1,1624645458
2631,Thank God For DNS Time Expirations,"So... let me lay the groundwork here.  At the time, I was working in operations but by and large I did 99% of the DNS work for my organization.  DNS failed? I was called.  But you ask, ""weren't you in ops?"" 

Yes, yes I was.  It didn't matter that I didn't own it (thanks network services).  Somehow I was the DNS guru... 

Anyway, fast forward and somehow I also was responsible for Big-IP and GSLB (also the guru).

So between the two, I am working for a VERY large healthcare and university center.  On the order of, if I was in Taiwan, said the name in English, they would know....

Stage is set....

I am working in DNS to implement our new GSLB on the Big-IP platform.  I'm monkeying around in DNS creating cnames and aliases for our new load balancing implementation.  One of my buddies, who I will call $clueless from here on out, is over my shoulder double checking my work.

As I said, VERY large organization.

$me - Hey $clueless, I am going to edit this record and remove this one.  Are we good?
$clueless - Looks perfect to me.
$me - *Brainfarting* ... Perfect, l'll push the update.  Can you clear your DNS cache and do a lookup?

*pushes update*

So please remember, I'm an ops guy.  I do DNS work for breakfast and eat lunch while owning the Big-IP.

$me - We good?
$clueless - Umm, the cname is good but the A record doesn't resolve?

$me- *last man to shit pants standing up since Custer* - What?
$clueless - Yeah, the main site isn't resolving

So the main site is a portal for our ENTIRE medical system.  It receives hundreds of millions of hits per day.

$me - *shits pants again* - FUCK
$clueless - What happened?

So, thank GOD for DNS expirations.

As it turns out, in what was a brainfart on my part, I marked an A record for deletion instead of a change.  $clueless didn't see it either.  

(In fairness, not $clueless' fault... he didn't do this every day.  He's just $clueless because he's a friend and was meant to double check my action... and if dumb shit happens, he does it 99% of the time)

So thank the stars for logs.  In about the span of 30 seconds, I take a look and see that I deleted something I shouldn't.  Wouldn't you know it, I have a recycle bin and am able to ""undo"" the DNS delete.

I restore the record.

If I recall correctly, our external records were timed to expire every fifteen minutes.  So in that one to two minute interval, if a major ISP had not cached our record (unlikely) we might have been bunked but otherwise, in the clear.

I looked at $clueless and basically said, we're gonna sit here for 15 minutes.  I'll monitor the VIP for traffic and monitor DNS for hits on the site.  Have the phone ready to call a major incident cause.  I might not have a job tomorrow.

A full 30 minutes later? Not one call, text, smoke signal or carrier pigeon.

I told him we had no choice because I can't send a device in for repair with absolutely no information. 

So he calls her, puts her on speaker, and after he explained I had some questions about the device, she immediately started yelling. I was listening to her 2nd hand; through the speaker of that guy's cell phone into his work phone's microphone and then out through my headset earpiece. Needless to say, her yelling was almost unintelligible. After she stopped yelling and I could get a word in, I asked her what the specific problem was and she again went on another tirade, except I heard her say the device wasn't connecting to the software properly. And I sigh to myself because I know more problems are going to arise from here. 

I tell her due to it being a connectivity issue, there are several troubleshooting steps we need to take before determining that repair service is needed. She then just cursed once more, says ""I don't have time for this"" and hung up. Its silent for a few seconds and then the IT guy goes ""a real treat, isn't she?"" and asked what we can do from here. I ask him if its at all possible for him to get access to the specific terminal she was using so we can troubleshoot and of course he says no, due to him working at the central office for the entire network of hospitals, an hour away from where she was calling from. I tell him the only option is to send it back to her and tell her to call our support line directly so we can investigate the problem with her. Again he reminds me that that will only make things worse. 

A few days pass and I'm hoping and praying that I'm not the unfortunate soul to get the call from her when she finally calls in. Begging the gods to inspire her to submit her ticket via email so I can talk to her that way. But no, bright and early Thursday morning, my very first ticket of the day, I get the phone call from her. This is (vaguely) how it went: 

Me: This is *HoungryHoungryHippo* from *indescript medical company*. How can I help you? 

Doctor Bitch: *after a few seconds of silence, she finally speaks in the most bitchy, condescending tone you can imagine* You told me to call you so I assume you know what this is about. 

Me: Are you calling regarding an existing ticket? *I didn't know who I was talking to at this point, we get hundreds of tickets a day* 

*she then rattles off the ticket number as fast as she possibly could. I had to ask her to repeat it slower. She sighs and repeats the ticket number except this time, as slow as she could, obviously mocking me. Which I just ignored. I pull up the ticket, realize who I'm talking to, and my heart sinks* 

Me: Oh I see it. You were having connectivity issues? If you could just... 

*she cuts me off* 

DB: How long is this going to take? Calling you for help is always a fucking nightmare. 

Me: Well if you'll let me diagnose the problem, I can get you on you're way. 

I remote in to her computer to check a few things. The device isn't showing up in the device manager (it connects via USB). I ask her if its currently plugged in and, in her signature bitchy tone, she says ""yes"". So I ask if she can try a different USB port. She asks ""do you mean one of the ports on the computer?"" and then I instantly knew what the problem was. I asked her if she was connecting to a USB hub and, if yes, to make sure the USB hub was connected to the computer. Sure enough, it wasn't. She was blowing a gasket over her device not even being plugged in. She plugged the hub in and the device was recognized instantly. Of course she didn't apologize for her behavior or anything. She just said ""its working now"", hung up, and I closed the ticket. 

And to put the icing on the cake, she gave me a 0 out of 5 satisfaction rating... what a bitch.",1,1624634044

2637,"You've been doing this job for over 2 years, how do you not remember the correct website?","I initially just shared this with some friends but they said I should post here so let's see how this goes. First time posting on this sub so forgive me if this isn't how I should put this.

So for background I work at a call center with the client being a popular standardized testing platform in the US that supports for example, Virginia's SOL testing, as well as, relevant for this story, Arizona's AIMS and AZELLA testing. This is done on the backend by the school staff through a platform we'll shorten to PAN to keep it mostly anonymous.

I had a call from who I legitimately believe to be our DUMBEST customer. She's been doing this for over 2 years now and yet she seems to have no idea what she's doing. She's called enough to have gotten me at least 5 times off the top of my head, she has over 60+ cases under her name and she can't even remember the website URL. Our exchange went a little something like this.

Her: ""I think I'm locked out or something. It's telling me my username or password isn't working""
Me: ""Can you read me the error message?""
H: ""It just turns red y'know?""
M (internally): ""Very helpful"" -_-
M: ""Try resetting your password with the 'forgot password' button on the sign in screen. That will send you an email with a link to reset your password.""
H: ""It's telling me my email can't be found. Did my account expire or something?""
M: ""Can you read me the URL?""
H: ""It's the (company name) site...""
M: ""Ok but can you read me the URL?""
H: ""The URL?"" (not questioning what that was, just asking if that's what I said)
M: ""Yes.""
H: ""Uhh login.(company name)?""
M (internally): ""You're a moron, that's not even close...""
M: ""Is it az.(PAN).com?""
H: ""No, let me try that."" (proceeds to use the forgot password link on that page instead of even attempting to sign in)
H: ""It says 'Success: Changes saved'. Now what?""
M: ""It sent you an email so you can reset your password with the link in that email""

At this point I get through my entire mandatory closing statement while she's trying to get off the phone and she asks ""Wait, can you check something for me?""

M: ""Sure, what do you need?""
H: ""I need to know if this student passed the test or not""
M: ""I'm sorry, that's not something I can check for you.""

Testing scores for students, even as vague as pass or fail are highly sensitive info to the point that of all the states we support on this platform only 2 or 3 of them even let the help desk staff see them and we absolutely cannot under any circumstances directly provide that sort of information to anyone. The most we can do is direct a customer on how to access that information for themselves. (Which is all we're ever allowed to do for anything anyway besides sending the customer a password reset request but still.)

At this point I have to give the entire closing statement again before I can hang up all while silently praying that she doesn't need something else before I can hang up.",1,1624585709
2638,Customer contacts me 3 times for encrypted data over 6 month period.,"A customer came in with a dead ThinkPad 6 months ago. It had a dead motherboard. 

He said there were some files he really needed off of it, so I popped in the drive and... BitLocker. 

I spent 2 hours on the phone with him working trying to get him to locate one of a dozen Microsoft accounts he has to see which one has BitLocker key, and none of them did. Well he gave up in abandoned the laptop here.

It just so happened that I have all of the old junk laptops that aren't worth anything, in a big cabinet.

While I did reuse his hard drive, since it was a really nice drive and he abandoned it, I did make an exact system image of his encrypted volume and put it on a crappy 1 terabyte spinning rust and popped back inside the laptop..

I forgot about it for quite a long time

Well he just contacted me now, saying that he absolutely needs the data back, and after spending 15 minutes trying to figure out which one was his, I told him that if the drive is encrypted there's no way to get the data off without the key. he said he would try someone else, and I said I doubt they'll be able to do it. Then he said he would bring it directly to Lenovo. At that point, I handed it to him and told him that I hope he has luck somewhere else, and I'm sorry I couldn't get it. I still think his best that is to look on his Microsoft account, look on any that he might have. Windows will not enable BitLocker without explicitly asking you to save either a file, or the key, unless you have a Microsoft account enabled during the account creation process. Which means he must have typed it in. It was a work computer so I told him to check his Microsoft account from where he used to work and he says he doesn't work there anymore. So I don't know how to help him.
If the data is truly that critical, it's likely that he will be able to retrieve it through his old employer on their Microsoft 365 if they still have an active subscription.",1,1624582928
2639,Sometimes the Universe uses your mistakes to cover your back!,"So, I was having a bad day. Got a sudden high priority ticket. One of my teachers was moving to a different classroom and wanted her computer lab moved with it. Like TODAY. 

Fortunately I had spare hardware on hand. I just needed to configure it. Two PoE network switches.

Configured them both and took them to the room to hook them up. One comes up just great. Green blinky lights all around. 

The other one flat out refuses to talk to the network. I drag my laptop out and console into it. Not as easy as you'd think. This campus is enormous. Easily a quarter mile end to end and of course this room was on the very opposite side of the campus from my office. And like an idiot I hadn't brought my laptop with me because ""Hey, what's the worst that could happen?""

I go in and look at my config. In my defense I did the config on Monday morning. The coffee had not reached useful levels. It was a simple fix of just tagging a port. But right as I was about to do so I saw my OTHER error. The one that had this machine actually started delivering data would have knocked out about a third of this wing. Is it still an error if nobody sees it but you? I dunno, but its fixed now!

1. User unable to use Laptop, sends me a whatsapp message at 07:15.   
Solution: Call him at 08:00 and advise that pulling the power cable from the laptop won't turn it off and he needs to hold the power button for a few seconds to force a proper restart.  

2. User has application open on wrong screen  
Solution: Show user how to drag apps between windows (User has worked here on two screens for around two months)  

3. Two missed calls from persistent pesky user who refuses to raise tickets, leaves voicemail to the effect of ""Hi, my e-mail isn't working so I can't raise a ticket please take a look""  
Solution: Remote in and user advises me the true issue is that all sub-folders had 'dissapeared'. After a couple minutes of:  
""Can I take control to fix this issue for you?""  
""Ok"" \*user continues to move mouse  
""I will need control of the computer to remedy this for you, please do not move your mouse""  
""ok"" \*user continues to move mouse  
""Do you want my help or not?"" (in a professional manner but read between the lines)

2642,Extra space(s),"I supported a school computer lab for several years, and this particular issue happened a lot. It was always a quick “fix,” but I still recall the sheepish realization that the first offender and I both shared early in my tenure.

Help desk student came to my office to inform me of a user with a login issue. I reset the user’s password and told HD to have the user try it again.  A few minutes later they were back, stating that the new password didn’t work. I confirmed that the new password DID work at a machine in my office. Maybe the lab machine was off the network?  Nope—pinged fine. Lost its domain binding? Nope—still listed.  Strange. I went to investigate. 

User was sitting there, trying different passwords over and over. They verified their username again, and everything looked right.

U: “I’ve tried every password I’ve ever used, plus the one you gave me. None of them work. I also tried it on that computer, but it’s broken, too.”

Me, turning to computer #2: “Let me try a different account.”

It worked. Checked networking and domain settings for good measure and all were good. Checked the user’s account with the temp password I set, and…it worked, too.

U: “What? How? My login still won’t work over here, though. Let me try the computer I sit at for class. I don’t want to be locked out again later.”

I watched as they moved down a few seats, tapped the space bar to wake the screen, then proceeded to attempt to login.  No luck. Then they slid down another seat. *Tap tap tap tap* on the space bar to wake it up. Still no login…

I checked the first machine again, and that’s when I saw that, in waking the machine, they’d managed to type a single space in the username field, before their username. They felt pretty silly about it, and I felt like a dummy for missing such a simple error.

HD now has a help doc that instructs users to completely clear both the username and password fields before trying again, and I’ve habitually only used CTRL, SHIFT, or the mouse to wake computers since then.",1,1624519124
2643,This is the job that never ends...,"Hello, everyone! Gather 'round, for I have a story to tell. A story of a job that was scheduled for six hours, but ended up taking much longer.

Relevant characters:

Me: Aqui!

PD: super cool city police officer.

PM: project manager.

POC: Point of Contact, basically a walking, talking site map and set of keys.

Sup: my supervisor, retired army with a low tolerance for incompetence and stupidity.

As I've mentioned in my previous posts, I work for an IT infrastructure company. We install the cables that make the network function. (For those familiar with the seven layers model, our work is ""affectionately"" labeled layer 0.) Well, one of the other services we offer is ""service calls."" For a contracted rate, a national management company requests one or two of our techs to be the on-site eyes, ears, and hands of techs several states away.

For this service call, sup and I were to go and exchange the customer's POSbrand switches for Cisco ones, then stay onsite while the customer engineer halfway across the country configured the new switches. The ticket said we were allotted 12 man-hours to complete this work.

We arrived, checked in with the PM, and went inside to get to work. After waiting for 30 minutes, we called POC to see what was up. Turns out, she had a flat tire and was going to be two hours late.

Ok, we can get paid to twiddle our thumbs for two hours.

Finally, POC arrived and we got to work Physically swapping the switches went smoothly, surprisingly. 11 switches spread across 3 racks in different suites in the building, about five hours.

The issues started when the time came to configure. We powered up the first stack, connected the dual routers to the indicated ports, and waited.

According to the customer engineer, the switches weren't stacking right. Or if they did stack, they didn't configure right.

Oh, boy.

What happened next was three hours of hard rebooting the switches. If the customer engineer changed anything between reboots, we never noticed.

The engineer got on a zoom call with one of his colleagues and finally sorted out the issues with the first stack (4 switches) at 6:00 pm. We had been on-site for eleven hours at this point.

(During this process sup advised me to ""make a nice comfy pile of boxes and take a nap, as we'll be here for a while"")

The next stack (3 switches) was also choosing to be a problem child, and two Cisco engineers were roped into the zoom call, as well as another customer engineer. Some firmware conflict between the config and the switches was preventing any of the switches with fiber ports from grabbing the master role.

At this point, someone on the call had a thought.

""Wait, what's the local time? How long have the techs been on-site?""

*crickets*

Sup: ""It is currently about 2100 hours local time, and we've been on-site for 14 hours.""

""OK, let's troubleshoot the web gui configuration later. For now, we need to get this done so the network is operational tomorrow. Has anyone started stacking closet 3 yet?""

Sup: ""I can send my junior tech to closet 3 to work on that one while we manually configure these switches, sound good?""

Everyone agreed to this course of action and I went down one floor and awaited a call from the customer engineer to power on the stack. (Cardinal rule of service calls, you do not plug in or unplug anything, even power, without explicit instruction to do so.)

At around midnight, I get the call to power on the last stack. To everyone's amazement and relief, it stacks and configured correctly by itself, so I just need to patch in all of the existing ports myself.

As I finish with that, I get a text from sup. The three-stack is working! He'll meet me in the main closet to collect our tools and leave.

Yaaaay!

I close the closet and open the door to leave the suite.

*BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP*

Yep, the alarm auto armed at midnight, and both POC and building security have gone home for the night.

Lacking a code and not wanting to smash the keypad, I leave it and meet up with sup. He agrees that there's nothing we can do about the alarm, so we should just pack up and leave.

We walk out of the building at 2:30 in the morning, looking forward to four hours of sleep before we have to come back and get some final paperwork.

Just then, a black van with blue flashers pulls up to us.

PD: ""we received an automated call from this address, is everything alright?""

*quietest groan ever*

Me: ""yeah, that was me, we got locked in and I tripped the alarm as I left.""

PD: ""OK, can I see your license so I can record that I made contact on my paperwork?""

Me: *silently pulls out wallet and fishes out my DL*

*sixty seconds of waiting for PD to radio my DL# to dispatch*

PD: ""Here you go, sir, thank you and have a good night.""

Fast forward to 7:00 am…

We come back and, once again, POC is late. Sup calls the PM with an update.

Sup: ""yeah, we're back on site to get our completion signature and box up the old switches, but POC is late again…""

PM: ""What are you still doing there?!? We'll fax them for signatures, and the local IT had better be capable of putting 11 switches in 11 boxes and slapping a shipping label on them. GO HOME. Get some sleep. And I want an email explaining your story on how a 12 man-hour job ended up costing us 39 man-hours! Bye!""

I don't know the full fallout of that day, but this exact operation was put on indefinite hold in all of the customer's locations while a postmortem was done on our job. That hold is still in place at time of writing, almost three weeks later.

TL;DR: I don't even know what happened, but I've been here almost a full day and we're still not done!

2644,Headphones don't work,"So I am one of two people at my MSP that works on Macs. One day this customer comes in with a 12 year old Mac laptop that has a laundry list of problems (screen is messed up, keyboard doesn't work right, touch pad is intermittent, not booting, etc). Naturally the first thing I tell her is that it would be more cost effective to just buy a new one. She has sentimental value in this machine, so she wants us to do it anyways.

In talking to her, she mentions that another company has worked on it (one that almost everyone knows but I won't name here, the main point is almost everything that comes in after they worked on it is worse off than before). I open it up and begin to diagnose it. Keep in mind, one of her chief complaints is that prior to it dying the headphone jack didn't work and it felt loose. On initial inspection I find a swollen battery that has vented a bit onto the TouchPad, keyboard, and logic board. I am just getting ready to order her parts when something catches my eye and I remember her headphone issue. There were plenty of signs that whoever was in this machine before me had no clue what they were doing, or just didn't care (battery was damaged by what looked like a screwdriver, screws were missing and/or stripped, etc). Well on this particular model the headphone jack is a tiny separate piece that plugs into the logic board. Where this part was supposed to be THERE WAS JUST A HOLE.

I know exactly what happened too. This tiny piece looks like it should just slide in after you get the logic board back in (which is about an hour task by itself). Well, it doesn't... there is about exactly one millimeter of logic board which prevents you from doing just that. Whoever worked on it previously must have gotten the board back in, realized the headphone jack wouldn't fit, and just gave up and put the machine all the way back together.

When I told the customer, she was furious at first, then proceeded to laugh for about five minutes. 

Moral of the story: if they put a purple label on it, don't take your computer to them (some people will get this).

TL:DR: a client's computer didn't have audio out and the headphone jack felt loose. The reason being that the previous ""tech"" didn't put it back in.",1,1624498598

We started getting the error doing different things, so I kept opening tickets every time another variant of the issue happened. 

They would always ask for a log file, so instead of logging on to the computer that originally reported the issue, I would recreate the issue on my computer and send the log file.

Finally after about the 15th ticket I opened with the variant of this bug, I was told they had a solution.  They said, the problem is on the computer.  All the issues they are seeing is coming from the same computer.  They then closed the ticket as fixed.

2654,"I'd tell them to stop, but I'm afraid they'd manage to screw that up.","So to recap my background for those that haven't read my previous stories; I'm a server implementation engineer now.  I travel the country installing the server back-end that supports my company's products and train the customers on how to use it all, I also teach the local IT person(s) the proper care and feeding of the new server.  

So to briefly break down the workflow; Sales sells the product, Factory builds the hardware, project coordinators schedule the installs, and I roll on site to make it all work.  However, this week has seen a huge break down in the project coordination.

I was scheduled for several weeks ago for a customer I would have flown out to Monday morning.  When I reach out to the customer Thursday to confirm they were ready, they weren't.  The project coordinators had put on the documentation that the customer purchased a new server through us (We work with a Whitebox vendor selling commodity hardware on the server end).  Except, the customer didn't purchase a new server.  The Project coordinator wrote down the customer's existing server (we do a bit of repeat business).   Unfortunately the customer was hoping on upgrading this system to our newer software product.... except that can't happen on the same iron since the new software runs on Linux and not Windows.  Even if I could, the 4 year old server doesn't even meet our minimum spec.  Sales should have told them it wasn't possible, but the sales guy (who is no longer with the company, nautrally) said whatever the customer wanted to hear.  

So I tell the project team, no server, no install.  They need to kick it back to sales to figure out how to save this fustercluck of a deal.  I cancel my travel arrangements and prepare for another week of doing work I self scheduled for upcoming customers (makes my time in the field a bit less stressful).  I go to bed Friday anticipating another week working from home with the dog at my side.  

Monday morning rolls around.  ""Hey, are you going to \[Other customer 100 miles away\]?"" I saw this job on my calendar, but did not get the assignment e-mail from the project coordinators.  So I book last-minute travel to *that* customer.  Because the project managers didn't want to have to reschedule them for August.

So I try reaching out to this customer. They're BYOServer, no problem. We do physical, Virtual, our server, your server whatever.  No answer, but the OGM matches the name on the documentation.  I leave a voicemail and e-mail my travel arrangements.  I take off around 4 because I have an ass'o'clock flight in the morning.  Doze off to find an e-mail from the customer in my Inbox when I wake to pack my suitcase  ""We didn't know you were coming tomorrow.""  

The whole point of our project coordinators is to document the installs, settle on SOW, and make sure I'm not doing something else.  The dates they assign me to do a task should be knowledge to the customer before I even pick up the phone to speak to them.  At least I can complete this customer even if they have as little preparation in advance as I have.

To add insult to injury, between the microchip shortage and global shipping in all tons of disarray my install for next week has been cancelled.  The server and SAN will not be delivered this week and probably not next week either.  But when the project manager for that project discovered no server next week asked me ""Can you do anything?""   My reply was ""No, I can't.  No server, no install."" I also wanted to add ""All I'll be able do is sit around and look impressive.""  

The good news though, I'm actually a few steps ahead on a server migration for a customer near my hometown where some kinfolk of mine still farm.  (Yes, I use kinfolk. I may live in the city, but I'm still country-fried)

Being rather familiar with issues like this, I forewarn him it is most likely a failing hard drive and we will have to install a new one and try to recover what we can. He immediately gets defensive saying ""well I don't think it's the hard drive, the last tech told me that and did something and it worked fine until now"". He goes on to tell me that this has happened at four other tech shops.

I assure him we will look at all possible issues and let him know. Out of curiosity I call one of the shops and ask about this client. They laugh and say he refused to buy a new drive, so they just installed windows on the partially dead drive and went on with their lives.

Now with this information, I was determined to get something visual to show him his drive was bad, so I pull it out and put it in a ""toaster"" and run a surface test. Keep in mind, some of the worst drives I have seen have only shown a couple of red, or bad, blocks in this test. Well I run it and walk away, only to come back to HALF OF THE SCREEN BEING RED! I have no clue how this drive was still spinning and BOOTING WINDOWS 10. Armed with that, he finally bought a new drive. Needless to say, nothing was recoverable.

TL:DR: An old man refused to believe his drive was dead, so other techs kept installing over it to band-aid the problem. Drive was over 50% gone and no data to be recovered.",1,1624420913

2658,Good tech support vs. Bad tech support,"LTL FTP

Today's tale centres around a graphics tablet and for me, perfectly demonstrates the impact of quality tech support in the work place.

As a bit of background, I'm a teacher by trade but also serve as resident tech support for friends, family and colleagues (probably why this sub resonates with me like it does). I recently started a new job at a large university and as I received a laptop my manager has had locked in a cupboard since the start of the pandemic I have had a lot of calls to IT to install various software. My final call with the same wonderful tech has left me quite impressed overall, highlighting the difference that good tech support makes. 

Before I detail the good tech support of which I speak, I want to share an anecdote from my previous employer for whom I was originally intending to use a graphics tablet I had purchased for remote maths lessons:

I went to my head of department to explain that I had a graphics tablet for the eventuality that we would be teaching from home - the school had stuck to in person teaching for various reasons but would have to close for a few weeks if enough students tested positive for the 'rona. The response I got was that it wasn't happening on a school machine. Last time we needed drivers installing, it took the school's parent company a year to send someone out. 

This brings me quite nicely to the last call I had with IT at my current employer:

Cast: user (me), tech (the amazing tech I dealt with). 

*Towards the end of a long week troubleshooting and installing various software from the university website, I had one last thing I wanted to set up - my graphics tablet. All previous software installations had been fine so far but the .exe for my graphics tablet was requiring an admin password as it wasn't from the university website. Reluctantly and slightly worried I was tempting fate with how smooth things had gone thus far, I put in one final call to IT...*

*To my surprise, the tech who had been dealing with my queries all week once again picked up the phone:*

User: ""Oh, hi again. One last thing hopefully, I want to install some software for a graphics tablet but I'm being asked for an admin password.""

Tech: ""No worries""

*User's heart skipped a beat, could it truly be this simple?*

Tech: ""I've sent an email like last time, can you click on the link and I'll walk you through so I can have remote access.""

*Tech walks user through and in no time they are both staring at the desktop.*

User: So, it's just this .exe file here. Looks like you need to enter an admin log on to install it.

*Tech had grown wise to such tricks however, or maybe they were just doing their job properly. This will never be known but User - with his limited and haphazard aproch to amateur tech support - was certainly impressed by what came out of her mouth next.*

Tech: ""Looks good, can you show me where you got this file from first please?""

*The penny dropped. User pinched himself, he was living a minor and very mundane fantasy. HIS VERY OWN TALE FROM TECH SUPPORT!*

User: ""Sure, hang on a sec...""

*With butterflies in his chest, user navigated to Chrome where he had sourced his driver - directly from the manufacturer's website nonetheless.*

User: ""Here look, this is the manufacturer's website. This is definitely the correct model.""

*User scrolled down, highlighting the product image and holding his graphics tablet to the camera.*

Tech: ""Great, I'll get it sorted then.""

*Tech may have missed a trick in not asking User to download the file again to double check. We won't go to hard on her for that as she may have worked out the calibre of user she was dealing with here. She works her magic and in no time everything is set up.*

Tech: ""You just need to restart now. Can you save anything you have open and then reboot please?""

*User did just that, reclining back into his chair. Riding the immense high from finally finding good tech support after all these years. Once the high faded, user noticed a blue screen. There was a windows update and it was taking some time. Realising Tech was still on the call, he decided to let her get on with her day and hopefully not encounter any incompetent academics or students.*

User: ""Ah, sorry. Just realised there's a windows update. I'm happy to call yuu back if there are any issues after it's done, wouldn't want to waste your time.""

Tech: ""Okay, thanks. Don't hesitate to give us a call if there is anything else you need.""

*After such a pleasant call, User pondered for a few moments on the slight shake in Tech's voice has she signed off. Looking back, he hoped he hadn't just ruined any sort of talk time metric that she is being monitored on...*

TLDR: A user tells a story of amazing tech support. For him it has made an aspect of his job so much better. Please remember this next time you are finished dealing with an awkward user!",1,1624403861

2661,"""Unsolvable Trouble Ticket""","This happened back around 2000. I was working as a swing shift server admin for a large bank. Our location was one of three data centers.

Most nights were nut to butt. This night was slow. So, I took the opportunity to look for something to do.  I decided to check out the Day Shift Desktop ticket queue. There was a ticket open for over a year. This users monitor image would randomly shake. The team could not duplicate it. they replaced the monitor several times.

Challenge accepted. There are almost no employees there at night so I went for a walk. Found the users cube and the monitor looked fine. She had a very large CRT. This wasn't normal. Most had LCD's at this point. I took a look at her coworkers and almost immediately.

The user on the other side of the cube wall (who had a LCD Monitor) Had a electric desk fan sitting 6 inches from the back of the large CRT with only  cloth cube wall between them. I turned the fan on and the monitor wigged out. I left the owner of the fan a note asking her to relocate it.

I closed the ticket. The following day I was told that the day tech's were given a hard time all day over how simple solving the ""Unsolvable Trouble Ticket"" was.",1,1624394753
2662,No ma’am your password is…,"I used to work at a very standard national contact center. Most of the work we performed was also standard practice customer support. 

One day the phone rings and on the other end picks up a company employee across country. She’s nice enough but you can hear in her voice that she is losing her patience. She explains that is the 3rd-4th time that she has had to contact us regarding this issue. For some unknown reason the lady just cannot login into her back-office computer. Simple enough fix. I pull up her password on my end and ask her to verify what username and password she is using. She butchers it.. but close enough. I can tell she’s likely just entering the *right* password *incorrectly*. 

“Alright ma’am so I’m going to read off your password to you okay?-” I proceed to quickly ramble off the password followed by the obligatory “-and remember this password is case sensitive so those letters must be capitalized.” “Ooooh okay!” She sounds like she gets it. I hear her typing in the password followed by a very annoyed “it still didn’t work!” 

I ask her to try one more time for me, and by this time I’m dialed in remotely. I begin to notice the little black dots appearing where the password should be is clearly longer than the password we just discussed. “Hold on, hold on ma’am”. I explain the situation. She rebuttals “Well I’m typing exactly what you told me!” 

As a last ditch effort I pull up the actual password on her display. I quickly move the cursor back and forth over the password highlighting it. “Okay ma’am THIS is your password. Can you see it?” She explains she understands with a drawn out “ohhhh” once again. Right before she starts typing I reassure her “and remember it’s case sensitive so the capital letters HAVE to be capitalized.” She begins to type and I immediately notice it’s way too long again. 

At this point I’m frustrated. “Ma’am. I just showed you your password on the screen and your clearly typing something else. Can I ask what you’re typing?” 

In an angry voice she yells at me “Well you told me my password was **casesensitive**!”

TL;DR: Customer who forgot their password thinks their password is literally “case sensitive”.",1,1624394350
2663,It's in your name,"I manage a computer help desk for an independent hospital. One of my techs sent over this call they just received. We get referred to as the help desk even though our technical department name is Computer Support.

2664,Let me teach you about a little thing called “the alphabet”,"Hi TFTS, long time lurker, first time poster. 

Obligatory disclaimer: on mobile, so formatting.

I don’t work in tech support per se. I program industrial machines and SCADA systems, but of course, I have to support the systems my company installs. With one particular customer, this has led to a great many tales worth telling.

To give a little context to this customer, they _have_ an in-house IT department of about three people. Early on in the project, they openly admitted to having no idea about OT and told me to just let them know what I needed from them to do my job. I wasn’t entirely sure, so, they just gave me domain administrator privileges for their entire company, which I still have to this day. Anyway, on to the story!

Back in around 2014, my company designed and installed an automated production line for the customer, including a basic historian and reporting feature. Once it’s all up and running, the French project manager (who we’ll call Pierre, because he’s about the most stereotypically French person I’ve ever met, and Pierre is the most stereotypical French name I can think of) decides that he and several other people want four reports emailed to them every morning, showing trend data from the previous 24 hours’ production. OK, no problem. I open up the reporting software and create trends showing the required data, then create a job to print this report to a folder at 5am each day. Test it out, everything works fine. Every morning at 5am, four files appear in the folder, looking something like:

Doofenshmirtz_Machine_yyyy-mm-dd_05-00-00.pdf
Skyhook_Machine_yyyy-mm-dd_05-00-00.pdf
SomeOther_Machine_yyyy-mm-dd_00-05-00.pdf
Widget_Machine_yyyy-mm-dd_05-00-00.pdf

Then, the customer’s IT department took care of automatically emailing them out to the relevant people.

Unfortunately, a few months later, Pierre needs a couple more reports added, and this breaks the email script. Also, the person who wrote the email script has moved on, and the remaining IT department have no idea where to even find this script, and when they _do_ find it, all they manage to succeed in doing is breaking it even further and then losing it again.

After weeks of back-and-forth, during which I try to make it clear that I’m working on it, but that the hold-up is with their own IT department, while at the same time trying not to throw their IT guys under the bus, I decide to just map a shortcut to the reports folder onto Pierre’s desktop, to at least get him off my case for a while. I remote into his machine and set up the shortcut, open it up, and show him how all the reports are in the folder, and he can just grab whichever one he needs, whenever he wants. I assure him that I will eventually get his emailed reports happening again, but in the meantime, this should work just fine. Pierre is happy.

Until the next morning, when I receive a phone call from a very irate Frenchman. As soon as I answer, Pierre immediately launches into a tirade about how all his reports are missing.

Me: “What do you mean? You remember we set up a folder on your desktop so you can access them directly?”
Pierre: “Yes and there’s nothing there! All my Widget Machine reports are gone! All that’s left are the Doofenshmirtz machine reports! What’s going on with this useless crap of yours?”
Me: “Hang on, let me take a look.”

I log into the reporting server and open up the reports folder. All the reports are there.

Me: “I’m looking at the folder now Pierre, I can see all four reports from this morning right now. You didn’t copy the reports to somewhere else or anything?”
Pierre: “No, I just clicked on the folder you put on my desktop and there’s nothing there! Only the Doofenshmirtz machine! No Skyhook machine, no SomeOther machine, no Widget machine! They’re all missing!”
Me: “Can I remote into your machine and take a look? I don’t understand why they wouldn’t be showing up.”

I remote into his machine, open up the folder, and immediately see the problem.

Me: “Pierre…Pierre…the reports…they’re in _alphabetical order_. Scroll down.”

TL;DR: User sorts files by name and then has to be reminded that files sorted by name will appear in alphabetical order.

P.S. It was at this point that I decided to write a new email script myself, which led to one of the most satisfying moments of my career, but that’s a story for another time.",1,1624343348
2665,"I'm sorry, we've billed how many hours on this customer??","2 years ago I took a job at an MSP that promised me loads of training and all kinds of salary improvements as I proved myself with certs. They never delivered on either end and I left that job. Here's my favorite story from working there

&amp;#x200B;

$me

$L1- level 1 tech that somehow made as much as me at L2

$L3- level 3/engineer/tech boss, #2 in charge of MSP

$Customer- medical company owner, very cheap, and in this case, very impatient (rightfully so)

&amp;#x200B;

When I started working at this MSP, I remember that $L1 was working on a laptop and backing up a massive PST file from outlook so he could repair and possibly wipe the computer for some unknown reason. $L1 and $L3 were talking about how this was the final straw and they would just tell the customer that there was nothing else to do shy of buying a new computer if this didn't work. Something also got mentioned about the hours spent on it to the tune of 15-20 so far. Thankfully the customer was contracted and this wasn't billed hourly for him. 

The customer was however notorious for not having any spare inventory and only buying himself a decent specced computer (everyone else was 4gb ram and 256hd in 2019).

$L1 finished whatever he was doing and returns laptop, nothing is heard from $Customer for a few weeks. Flash forward and I get a call from $Customer who is upset that his Excel Macro is once again not working for his POs and that it works on everyone's computer except his (which was true because one of his tech savvy employees wrote the macro). 

Since $L1 and $L3 had taken a look at it, now it's my turn to suffer this customer. $L3 tells me that he has done everything he can think of for this customer and has no clue how the Excel macro gets wonky on this guy's computer only. I talk to $customer and we setup a time for me to look at remote.

Later:

$Me: remote into $customer's computer and see that he has 2 monitors, one with terribly small resolution and the other (native display) which is much better. I select the native display and he shows me the error. The macros will run, but they're behaving oddly (buttons aren't where they should be and dialog boxes display at the bottom of screen instead of next to the buttons). 

$Customer: see??? it does this every time

$Me: hmmm... lets close it out and re-open. Excel now opens the sheet on the native display instead of the external monitor and things work normally. 

How's this?

$Customer: oh yes! this is perfect! thanks!

$Me: hangs up, thinking customer must just be the type that attracts weird errors

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*15 minutes later\*\*

$customer: hey it's doing it again

$me: remote in to native display, customer drags it over and shows errors, close and re-open. 

There you go

$customer: thanks! \*click\*

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*5 minutes later\*\*

$me: Hi $customer, is it doing it again?

$customer: yeah

$me: I look over the errors and start giving excel a once over. See that Excel shows that it is in a mode for compatibility rather than display. 

""Do you always look at this sheet on your external monitor?

$customer: yeah, why?

$me: ok, let me try something. (switched excel to display mode instead of compatibility mode and allow it to launch on external display). Now it works

&amp;#x200B;

Never got a call for the issue again

Apparently there was a generic driver installed for this super old monitor that the customer picked up and since we didn't purchase it or set that monitor up, no one knew it didn't have the right driver (or the best driver). Since it was a generic windows driver it seems to have not allowed Excel to display the macros properly when in compatibility mode, which, from what I can tell, it launched in because he always used Excel on this monitor and never his native screen.

$L1 and $L3 could never replicate the issue because they saw him do it, then had him email the file. When it worked fine on their machine, they thought it must be something else so they had him bring the machine in, only to not be able to replicate in office. They got so far off the trail that they thought something with the way outlook handled the attachment when the employee e-mailed it had caused the issue, even though the same file was emailed to them, by $customer. Each of them spent close to 10 hours working on this man's computer, when a quick remote session would have sufficed.",1,1624342827
2666,“The End is Near”,"I work for a large university in their over the phone tech support team. I was on a simple installing Microsoft Office 365 apps call with a nice old lady who decided to come back to finish her education. 

The installation was going good and she had about half way left on the progress bar so I decided to make some small talk so that my dead air (time not talking with the customer) wouldn’t go to high. I asked her “so how is the weather right now where you are?” And this is where this crazy story begins. 

The response “it was nice and warm but it got cold... this is it the end is near” then she proceeded to explain how she started a following of people who “are preparing for the end”. I then simply asked “so how is that download going” and I get back “if you don’t need my warning you will be the same as the rest lost and forgotten when the end time comes”.

2667,And the magic blue smoke appeared,"Not it, but I dabble (also on mobile)

Today at work we had one of our pos computers fritzing out.  All of our PCs are leased with a good service contract.  I reported the issue this morning, and the company had a service tech out at 2 pm.  As I was the one that discovered and diagnosed the issue, I told the tech what I found, and what I believed the problem was.

The problem: fine aluminum dust entered the not environmentally sealed enclosure and got past the dust screens in the itx case and was playing hell with internal contacts.   Tech went to check and bumped something.  There was a soft pop and the joyous smell of burnt electronics.  The magic smoke started rolling out a second later thick enough to be seen from the 20mm exhaust fan.  He said a replacement unit would be delivered in the morning.

He did ask how I knew.  My response was that the extrusion saw I use that makes a lovely pile of aluminum glitter, and when a new fan was installed to help cool a work area it blew some of the dust at the pos enclosure.  Tech is now trying to get approval for additional filters for each enclosure.",1,1624331748
2668,"Demons and Cantrips, a user POV","In this tale I'm the end user, I have no qualifications in anything relating to IT and must seek the guidance of an IT sage. 

We have one IT sage on site who supports about 100 users and has to jump to do the bidding of the owner or whichever person in manglement demands his attention. 

I've had an ongoing printer issue for the last month or so. I suspect that when it was last moved no one paid the blood sacrifice or undertook the appropriate rituals so now it has decided to cause hell. Essentially it stops responding to my requests and I used my limited knowledge and power to Remap the path to the printer until the power of Group Settings banished my efforts and I had to begin again. 

I did this over and over for about a week before contacting the IT sage because I'm an end user and I fear the righteous wrath of an IT sage (In reality I didn't want to bug an overworked IT employee). After that week I summoned up enough courage, detailed a missive to the IT sage covering the problem, my suspicions about the lack of a blood sacrifice and my extensive use of Remap. 

Then 3 weeks or so proceed to go by. I see the IT sage out in the wild and approach him. I see instant recognition (and perhaps a touch of haunted dread) in his eyes as he knows I'm going to mention the printer. After discussing it, he tells me to remind him next week and he'll get it sorted... or as I was about to discover he would attempt to empower me with the knowledge required to fight the demonic influence head on. 

He sent me an missive with a portal to realms I hitherto this point had never attempted to access. It was a link of sorts that would connect me to the elder gods that had created this fiendish machine. He also provided an image, highlighting the cantrip, entitled ""Universal 2"" that I would need to find in this realm and recite in order to potentially banish, or more likely temporarily subdue the demon inhabiting the printer. 

I set out on my quest and due to the expert navigating provided by my IT sage I was quickly able to locate the cantrip he had highlighted. I returned from the realm, cantrip in hand, ready to enact the spell. But wait! The spell had no starting point! All the words were there but the elder gods had played a trick on me and there was no way to execute the cantrip. 

I slumped over, but then suddenly sat up as I remembered a path I had long ago ventured down in my youth. The Device Manager! Surely it would be able to help me with this cantrip and execute it where I had failed. So off I went, pointed out the problem printer to the Device Manager, showed it the cantrip I had stored on my Desktop and begged for its aid against the printer demon.

The Device Manager, long tired of fiendish printers was more than happy to help and away it went!... until it too failed. For you see the elder gods had one more trick up their sleeve, the cantrip was unsigned! The Device Manager was powerless to continue reciting the cantrip and all was thought to be lost. 

I slumped in my chair. I thought long and hard. Surely the IT sage hadn't led me astray. He had often fought printer demons and was a seasoned warrior on this battlefield I had only just ventured onto. So I gathered my courage and decided to again venture into the realm of the elder gods. Maybe they had hidden the correct cantrip or disguised it to trick me into recovering the wrong spell. For if printer demons are so common, must it not be the elder gods themselves who imbue the printer with demonic energy when it is created?

Again I followed the link that the IT sage had provided to give me access to the hellish realm of the printer elder gods. This time I stopped and took stock. Yes, over there was the Universal 2 cantrip I had found before. But this time I avoided it, knowing it to be a trap for the inexperienced. I delved deeper, seeing monstrosities that I shall not mention for fear of bringing them upon myself. At last though, I found what had been hidden, a new cantrip ""Universal v4"". I exclaimed in joy for this must be the answer to my problem. I hastily claimed the cantrip and fled the realm of the elder gods, back to the safety of my desk. 

This time when I opened the cantrip, the point from which to execute the spell was immediately apparent. Thus I begun the incantation, targeted the correct printer and let loose the spell! Suddenly, with a binding flash of light the printer demon was subdued! The cantrip ended with a request to ""print test page"". With bated breath I confirmed this action and waited.... then the printer sprung into life with a squeaky cry of joy and happily churned out a single, solitary test page.

I gleefully told the IT sage of my adventure into the elder god realms and the battles I fought. He responded promptly, thanking me for regaling him with the tale and praising me for my ability to tackle the demon head on. 

Thus the printer demon has been defeated. How long this new found peace will last I do not know. However I shall stand vigil and attempt to protect this printer from future demonic incursions until the next time I am called to action. 

Tl,dr; printer is possessed by demonic influence and the end user seeks the aid of an IT sage to enact a cantrip.",1,1624330782
2669,No PT information,"I work in a clinic I am the only person in my department and I set it up. They decided to hire me and get me started prior to the department being operational, so in order to keep me gainfully employed they had me help out though various departments. This is not an issue as I've worked IT, Administrative, and pretty much every job that you can think of inside a clinic at some point, but this story takes place in our records department.

For those of you not familiar with healthcare, we need to keep records on all patients that come though the front door unless we transfer them completely to another facility (in which case then we need to keep records of where we sent them as well as evidence of their receipt), or if a certain amount of time has passed after a patient has died. When I first started I had ended up helping out our IT department with a complete network changeover (nothing major, checking ports, running cables, etc) and had received glowing reviews from my work so management decided to put me in with records to assist them in their change over from all paper to all digital with all patient records. They had made it though approx 100 of close to 10k. It took them two weeks.

I arrived to their department and I was greeted by a team of about 5 ladies, the youngest looked to be about 60 (I have nothing against someone's age but having to learn computers is different than growing up with them). I greeted them and made friendly chit chat at first. Before showing me how they had been working I learned that they were not in favor of going to an all digital system and that they wanted to stick to paper records.

When it came to scanning in files, they showed me how to work the scanner. They opened the top, put the page on the glass, hit scan, hit add doc to PDF, flipped the page over, and hit scan again before swapping it out. This PT file was on the thin side and had well over 50 pages. After about an hour and a half, it came time to save the thing off. I was told not to name the pt files and to leave the file as ""Untitled"" as it couldn't have any patient information on it, but just set it face down in an ""Inbox"".

After watching all this, I asked why they didn't use the auto feed and I was told that they didn't like having to reorganize the pages. Confused (and being a little intimidated by being the new guy) I just nodded and said, ""oh, okay"".

At that point they all decide it was time to go to lunch and invited me along but it was a salad place and I like my burgers so I politely declined, went to BK across the street, and came back figuring I could let it scan while I ate.

I took the first file, set it in the auto feeder, checked the settings, enabled 2 sided scanning with blank page elimination and hit go. I sat down and made it though about 1/3 of my burger before the doc was done. I checked it on the preview, no issues so I saved it off and set up the next one. 

By the time they got back I had scanned close to 50 records and the inbox was so full that I had to make another stack. They were shocked to say the least. When they asked how I did it so fast I showed them. None of them knew that you could set the machine to scan pages 2 sided. What would have taken them years to do now was able to be done in a few months. 

I was removed from their section before completion due to my section coming online, but they still reach out to me for help before they ask our actual IT crew and they still bring me brownies once in a while.

TLDR; Eliminated close to two years worth of work because I like to mess with settings.",1,1624312155

Someone from corporate saw my post and made arrangements for them to be shipped to a company that does end-of-life disposal for most of our tech, and left me all the necessary details in a PM. Excellent! Let me just box these up and take them to our shipping and receiving department so they can handle it from here.

$Me: I have eight pinpads here ready to be shipped out to \[company\] and here are the details.

$OverworkedCoworker: Alright. Is the whole pallet getting sent out or just those?

$Me: The whole what?

$OverworkedCoworker: \*points to a pallet in the overhead with one huge box on it\* There's about twenty more just like those on that pallet from over a year ago when they did some install on the front end.

$Me: Please drop that pallet for me.

Sure enough, that pallet had probably twenty more of the obsolete style pinpad, as well as six new ones unopened, with all the brackets and hardware to go with them. Not wanting to take up space on the floor, I whipped out my phone and started taking pictures of every relevant paper I could see before letting my coworker get it back in the overhead and running back to my office to ask more questions to the helpful woman from corporate on that forum. It turned out they already anticipated a pallet's worth of pinpads being leftover from the refresh and the shipping arrangements were for that pallet entirely. Double excellent! I relayed all of this information to my coworker and the assistant manager above me. At first she wanted me to just keep the six new ones, but changed her mind when I said we might get billed when they receive the pallet with X less than were shipped or marked as complete by the original installers. Things seemed fine, until a month passed and we still had the pallet. I also had more time at this point to ponder things, and I realized the following:

By my count, the pallet had three fewer new pinpads than it should given how many were supposed to be installed around our store, and there existed three registers that had been so neglected, scrapped for parts, and used as storage shelves that they were unrecognizable as registers at the time of the refresh and did not get the pinpads replaced. They did not even have plexiglass put up last year for distancing. Those three pinpads were definitely removed from the pallet, but not installed, and nowhere to be found. Now knowing that this project wasn't completed and there are incomplete registers, it didn't seem right to try to send them all back. I went back to my manager to discuss this further.

$Me: Hey, remember that pallet I told you about with the pinpads I said we might get charged for if we don't send them back?

$Manager: Yeah, I do

$Me: I changed my mind. I want to take three pinpads and the corresponding brackets off the pallet to use to finish the installation from a year and a half ago for these three registers.

$Manager: Do it

Music to my ears! Even if we hadn't gotten charged yet for those extra three and do because of this, it's easier than deciding later that we need to get these registers up and running and placing orders for new stuff that could get lost or just be the wrong thing. I shamefully go back to shipping / receiving and ask my coworker to drop the pallet for me again so I can take what I need and get to work. It was pretty simple to do: a few screws to remove the old bracket and put the new one on, and the new pinpad clicks right into place. Old pinpads are already on the pallet and I just toss the old brackets and cables in the trash since none of the ones from the original install were saved either. Making the shipping arrangements over again, on the other hand, didn't go quite as smoothly. The company changed social media platforms and all my PMs with the relevant information got wiped, and I learned a valuable lesson about writing everything down. The phone number in the last page of the 2019 project just rings forever, the carrier requires a BOL, and the company we're shipping it all to can only provide me with the destination address. I had to get with a supervisor who worked in that department previously to help me create one and schedule a pickup. They missed that appointment, by the way.

In between installing the new pinpads and calling to arrange for them to be shipped off, two more old pinpads were 'rediscovered' and given to me. One was dug out of the manager's office during cleaning after leadership changes; the other was buried in a tool chest on a shelf I somehow missed when trying to organize everything at the end of 2020.",1,1624300577

2679,My modem stopped working due to 9/9/99 bug!,"Background: In the late ‘90s, I worked for a software company that wrote software for backend offices of primarily fast food restaurants. I was a software developer, but when lines backed up, we were sometimes asked to help tech support.

The bug: Before the Y2K bug, there was it’s lesser known cousin the 9/9/99 bug. Some really old systems would use 9999 as a halt command, and they would also code the date 9/9/99 as 9999, so these two issues would lead the the “9/9/99” bug. I do not know of any instances where this bug actually happened, but the media hyped it a bit as an early stress test for the Y2K bug. While we did have to make changes to our code for Y2K, our code never used 9999 as a stop command and would’ve coded 9/9/99 as 990909.

The cast: CSR = customer service rep, client = client. I was working that day, but not on the call. We all heard about it right after it happened.

The story: Client calls in complaining that the 9/9/99 bug has caused their modem to stop working. None of their stores were polled! (Our software would use external modems so that the back office computers could poll each store’s registers to see what was sold, etc., the previous day.)

CSR: Sir, can you tell me what the lights on your modem look like?

Client: Modem?

CSR: Yes sir, the box with lights that probably sits on top of your computer.

Client: Oh, that! It was making a funny sound last night, so I turned it off.

CSR: Sir, I think we’ve located the problem.

It turned out that the client was so worried about the 9/9/99 bug, they stayed late, which they don’t usually do. Self-fulfilling prophecy achieved.",1,1624205108
2680,"""I CAN'T RESET MY PASSWORD! (literally)""","As an independent consultant, I see all kinds of tech support issues. But, the best stories never seem to come from my regular clients. Instead they almost always come from contract gigs I use to fill in some of the slow times. Here is a quick story about one such incident.

**Scene**

I am on a 3 month contract, essentially on call as overflow phone support. It was an easy gig. I just sat at home and when the call center got too busy, they would start switching over tickets to some of us remote guys. All I had to do was be available between certain hours and have a quick turnaround on the first touch. 

This was in the beginning days of the pandemic when everyone had just started working from home. Most of my tickets were easy such as VPN connection issues or provide quick tutorials on video conferencing solutions. I was happy to be at home and have work that would keep me there for a little bit as the entire world went to hell in a hand basket.

**Ticket - Password Reset**

The call center must have been getting slammed early on this particular day because I woke up and immediately had a ticket. That almost never happens. However, no big deal. Just log on, check the status, do a quick update, and contact the user (I will call him Jim). He picks right up. 

IT Guy (me): ""Hello, I see you have a problem reseting your password to access the network via the VPN.""

Jim: ""Yeah, I have tried the reset password features about a dozen times now and every stupid time it just errors out.""

IT Guy: ""OK let me check a few things.""

I browse his user profile and everything looks OK. He is not suspended or locked out. Figuring that he must just be typing the wrong password over and over again, I do reset his password in the admin portal to start troubleshooting..

IT Guy: ""OK I reset your password on the network. Try to login in but use the password XXXXXXXX.""

Jim: ""Gotcha, just a sec.....Great that worked!""

IT Guy: ""Maybe you were just typing the wrong password over and over again, sometimes it happens....""

Jim: ""OK now I need to sign out and reset my password though.""

IT Guy: ""Do you mean you want to set it to something other than the one I just gave you?""

Jim: ""Yeah the one you gave me isn't my password.""

IT Guy: (a little confused) ""Well I reset your password to that, but I can set it so next time you login you can set your password to whatever you like.""

Jim: ""Yeah I need to change it back to my password so everything works.""

IT Guy: (still confused) ""Everything should work if you use that password, but if you want to change it that is not a problem.""

Jim: ""Look I told you that is NOT my password. I need to set it back to MY password.""

IT Guy: (confused, but giving in at this point) ""OK I've set your user profile so the next time you login it will prompt you to input a new password. Do you want to try while I am on the phone?""

Jim: ""Yeah let me give it a try....""

I wait about 90 seconds hearing Jim pounding away on his keyboard cursing. Finally, frustrated he gets back on the line.

Jim: ""See now it won't take my password. What the hell is going on here?""

IT Guy: ""Let me reset your password back to XXXXXXXXX and try it again.""

It works with the same result so clearly Jim must not be entering the password confirmation correctly.

Jim: ""...But I still need to change the password back to my password.""

IT Guy: ""OK let me set it so you can reset the password at your next login once again. If it doesn't work can you send me a screenshot of the error?""

Jim: ""Yeah no problem. Let me try this all again.""

Another 90 seconds pass with Jim cussing in the background.

Jim: ""This \*bleeping \* thing simply will not let me reset my password!""

IT Guy: ""Jim, send me a picture of the error please if you can through your phone or another device.""

After stumbling around for about 10 minutes, he finally gets around to a picture of the screen to me via his iPad.

The error says ""password is not valid, enter new password.""

Now I understand what Jim is doing wrong. The error for this credential management system, when a password conflicts with the security policy, will generate an error of ""(password that was attempted to be entered) is not valid, enter new password."" (So if your attempted reset was ""dollhouse123""and that violated the password policy the error would say ""dollhouse 123 is not a valid password...."") Here all this time Jim was trying to trying to type in his password as the word ""password"" which created the confusing error message.

I explained that ""password"" was not a valid password under the new security policies to Jim, who objected at first because he was also under the false impression that only his user name and that password would give him access to all of his files. So I also had to explain the concept of how a network user profile also works to Jim in addition to reminding him of the new policy.

Total call time - 139 minutes. Good thing I was getting paid by the hour.

**TLDR**...User calls up because he cannot reset his password. Problem is he was trying to use ""password"" as his user password which was creating a confusing error.",1,1624176875

2686,"Missed a troubleshooting step, client makes sure the mistake is branded on my soul.","Client emailed in with a screenshot of an error they were getting when trying to use a feature in the system. This particular feature is something maybe only six clients out of our entire userbase still actually utilize, and I haven't seen a question come into our queue on it in a year and a half.

I check the feature they indicated, and couldn't reproduce the error. I email the client back asking what steps they were taking to produce said error. This was after double checking his screenshot - he only sent a screenshot of the error, not the actual thing he clicked on to produce it.

About fifteen minutes later, he calls in and asks for me. Tells me that the error is being produced on the *other* tab that controls the feature that had apparently blanked itself out in my brain (no, I don't know why this old-as-fuck feature is split up into two entire sections). He goes on for a bit about how he wished I'd taken the extra step to see it, but isn't necessarily nasty about it, just disappointed.

I apologize more than once for the error and now that he's indicated where it came from, I'm able to reproduce. I let him know I'm on my way to submit a bug report to our development team. He reiterates that it should have been easy for me to see and that he again wished I'd taken the ""next step"", but that ""it happens"".

Later, after notifying him of the bug being created per procedure, he sends an email back in reply saying thank you. And again, that he wishes I'd taken the next step in troubleshooting, but understands that it was an error. More apologizing from me.

A couple hours later, there is a CSAT rating of ""satisfied"" in my inbox (it goes Happy, Satisfied, Unhappy). I'll give you three guesses what his rating description said and the first two don't count.

I will wholly and 100% admit that I could have simply not been a sleep deprived idiot and clicked around a little more to find the error. Yet, I also maintain the stance that this guy unnecessarily went out of his way to ensure the mistake was hammered into my brain.

TL;DR: I ask a client for extra info instead of digging further on my own. Client goes above and beyond to note the mistake verbally and in writing.",1,1624028085
2687,Grandpa's digital camera doesn't work at all,"This story is from before I really was in IT, since I was still in high school. This story takes place around 2002 - 2004 iirc. I was the go-to tech support for my maternal grandparents. My grand father had just bought a new a pretty early digital camera and was having fun with it, trying to figure out how the machine worked using the manual.

&amp;#x200B;

He got pretty far with it, but kept running in to an error so he phoned me. It sounded pretty strange to me, every time he snapped a picture his Sony would tell him there was an error. But the picture was there and it was good. So, on my bicycle I hopped to pay them a visit.

&amp;#x200B;

Once I had the camera in my hands, I was able to take pictures and didn't notice anything wrong with it. I didn't even see the error message my grand father had been having issues with. So I hand it back to him and the first picture he takes displays the error message again, according to him. So we repeat the steps now both looking at the display to find out what goes wrong. So he snaps a picture and directly says: ""There it is!"".

\&gt; ""Storing""

It clicked for me, the camera had been setup to use the Dutch language, not the English language. Though somehow this message was still in English*. I didn't register the discrepancy but there it was. ""Storing"" in Dutch means Malfunction / Failure. Not to write a file to memory and store it there.

2692,Im an Engineer!,"This happened back when I was in my last year in college and I was an intern for a textile company in their IT department.

My senior, who was a chill dude was the one that kept me company during my stay and he was the one who I picked up most of my skills from. We'll call him ""Jay"". 

Now, one day we had this one request that came in from one of the officers in another department, who we'll call ""Max"". So Max complained that his Desktop PC (an Intel Pentium 4) would not turn on. Jay and I went to his office to check it out. The computer wouldn't turn on. We tried all the standard troubleshooting stuff from changing the PSU, reseating the RAM, CPU and video card, but nothing worked. Finally, Jay told me to grab the test motherboard of the same brand and model (It was an Asus board from what I can remember) we had from storage and so I brought it to him. We swapped out the motherboard and lo and behold, the PC turned on and started to work

So Jay went over to Max and told them he had a faulty mother board. Max asked further what could have caused the board to fail. Jay said, he wouldn't know unless more testing was done, but he said it could be anything from a bad chip, blown capacitor or a factory defect of some sort. Now, Max was an Electrical Engineer by trade, so he thought it could be easily fixed by resoldering some parts. He had a tester so he can figure out which chips, capacitors or whatever was blown and just simply replace it by resoldering a new part onto it. Jay explained that it wasn't as simple as that but Max said he can probably fix the motherboard on his own. Jay did try to dissuade him to no avail. In the end, Max asked us to hand over the defective board so that he could ""fix"" it himself and save the company a few extra bucks. 

A few days later one of my co-interns brought in Max's PC and there was a label on it that said ""for repair"". I was curious as to what had happened. Jay came in later and when he saw Max's PC in our work desk, he just rolled his eyes. When we opened the PC we saw some solder blobs on some capacitors near the video card and there was a faint burnt smell coming off it. I never got to work on it, but I heard from my co-intern that Jay tested it later in the day and found out that the CPU was dead and the RAM had become faulty causing Windows XP to crash to a blue screen almost every time when he tested them on another motherboard.

Our head IT boss never re-issued a new desktop computer to Max ever since and gave him a used Laptop instead. From time to time when me and Jay would pass by Max, he would just give us a blank look and ignore us completely.",1,1623973197

2699,Tech support = Emotional support,"This is a story from a few years back when i worked tech support. It was in a legislative building in which nearly every one of the people we helped (especially the secretaries) believed they were head chief of the planet, And one of them calls for help. He had lost what was essentially everything hed set up for the next legislative session on accident, and didnt notice until when that session started (so 6ish months of normal computer use between these points).

He was very respectful and nice about it, didnt blame us for his actions in a surprising twist of the norm, and was extremely co-operative in trying to solve the problem. I did the usual checks, it was a flat dead empty personal drive. no backups, because in the name of 'security' (which i quite appreciate the thought of, but i suspect it was actually just because he wanted to be able to use the drive on a mac instead of a state laptop) he had intentionally put everything on his own drive he brought in and not one of the ones we make regular backups of. Not even a hint of his work on the backups. I suspected he either brought in the wrong drive, or had it wiped by security, as there was no evidence of any data being formatted over or the drive having been used much (though there wasnt the usual stuff on a new drive either). No recovery software detecting anything useful. The proposal that he had the wrong drive was taken as an insult, and he assured me that he knew what IT was capable of, that we could reconstruct it. I showed him what the recovery software was showing, and he the lost any of the previously kind demeanor at this point. He began describing what he 'knew we could do' and it was apparent that he expected me to law and order this shit. A request ive heard quite a few times, but made this incident stick out was how he insisted he had seen this in real life, and i just didnt know what i was doing. He did not want me to escalate it to someone higher up, or bring in anyone else. instead he kept me in his office for over 2 hours describing 'things he knew we could do' to see if i could magic that up, and talking intermittently about how screwed he was and what this would effect while being on the verge of tears. Given his insistence on that being the drive i think he did get it wiped by security, though he wouldnt specify, just said he 'lost it'. (you are supposed to get drives wiped at the end of session if you used a personal one for state stuff, im not cybersec and dont know shit about if this was enforced or what they do exactly.) I was really just providing emotional support and reassurance at that point. There have been many times in my 2 years of tech support where my job ended up being 'reassurance and grief councilor' about broken tech or lost data. I think that skill is underappreciated by most team managers. As that was one of my last tickets before i got transferred to a different job, its the one i think back on the most. I was just really bored the entire time he kept me there. I was sympathetic to his plight but there was nothing to do but either let me talk to others or drop it, compared to how tense i was dealing with the first time someone acted like that. I wonder if all the 'deal with peoples emotions' jobs get like that after a year or two.

( this was a few years ago so i might be remembering a few specific details wrong. and a note: i was specifically not allowed by contract to invite or escalate or talk about any situation involving a specific representative or legislatures data without explicit permission, unless it was to HR. I could go ask questions and find out generally how the wiping process works and if it could be undone and get back in contact myself and what not, but as he didnt specify thats what he did and i wasnt particularly invested in this issue, i didnt care enough to do so.)",1,1623945500

User: ""great I only need nondescript cloud platform anyway...""

I hand User a web only device for the day.

30 minutes go by, new ticket from same user. still hate seeing tickets sitting so I jump on it, easy fix anyway right?

User: ""Hey I since I don't have my regular computer, and we just had the password policy change can you reset my password pretty please.""

me: (thinking ok, I get it we just flipped the switch today no worries) ""Yeah no problem"" I change it and write out the password on a sticky (on login users are immediately asked to change it) and walk down the hall to User's office, but I see User and User2 driving away in User's car. ""Ok, I guess User can wait until they return""

I come back and sit down at my desk and look at my queue, there is a response in User's ticket ""Hey me, nevermind I remember it now"" which I don't see until after I do the change.

I sigh and wait for user to come back so I can hand them the sticky.

I get another ticket from User ""Hey me I am locked out of my account when I asked you to not change it.""

I message my coworker ""Hey Coworker, can you take this password ticket please?"" as I was back at my other tasks. just as Coworker was typing out their response, User walks in the door to Ops and says ""I can't login to my account!"" I was on support chat with another user and I said ""can you come back in 5 minutes?"" User said ""I'll be in room #%$"" I sighed and said ""Ok I'll come to you in 5"" I Printed out the password on a full size letter piece of paper and handed it to them. 

It is not my fault you can't remember the password you just created.",1,1623888137

2711,The Mysterious Black Screen,"I work at a small electronics store in a smallish city, a customer buys an item from us and while I am finishing up the transaction they asks me if they can inquire about an issue they are having, which isn't uncommon, we get these questions everyday.  
With a sufficient background in computing, I agree, and they explain to me that their desktop is unable to boot, as it only shows a black screen.  
Go through the usual issues, busted cable, broken monitor, etc.  
Narrow it down to a hard drive issue. When I ask them as to how much they write to and delete from their drive, they reply to me that they mod their games pretty frequently, quite common, nothing out of the ordinary.  
Then casually they mention that they **format their hard drive** around **once or twice a month** to uninstall the mods.  
Needless to say, I informed them that they need a new hard drive, and to not format the drive and to just uninstall the games.",1,1623851965

Then she went on to tell me how she wasn't going to be talked to like some child.

'This is gonna go great ' I moaned internally.

Her computer was running slow. We ran through a few things and I asked her to shut down her pc and let me know when it was off.

About 4 seconds later she tells me 'okay its off '

Impossible . 

I ask her to turn it on again and let me know when we get back to the desktop.

3 seconds later 'okay its back up.'

'Ma'am can you tell me exactly how your shutting down your computer ?'

Here it comes... she launches into a tirade about how she works on a computer every day at work and blah blah blah for about 5 minutes.

' I understand ma'am and I'm simply asking the steps to verify you are taking the proper procedure for THIS computer'


'Of course I am.i push the button on the computer.'

'Is that the computer where you see the images or under your desk ?'

'What do you mean ? Thats a stupid question.  The computer where the information  comes up

I take a deep breath.

'Ma'am thats not the computer. That's your monitor.'

'What ? Your not making sense. Thats how we all shut down our computers at work.'

I explain that at work she doesn't have a computer, but a workstation on a network. I explain that turning off the monitor does not affect the pc at all. Then I walk her through proper shutdown procedures and we reboot her pc.

When it reboots it installs several updates including multiple driver updates. 

'Hey ! You fixed the colors '

She never mentioned video issues

2715,Don't rule out the environment.,"This tale goes back to the early 90s. I'd been working for an IT consulting company. Back then it was Novell LANs and PCs with 386 and 486 processors. 

One of the new clients decided  they would upgraded their older computers. We went with the popular brand and considered the best back then, of Compaq desktop computers. They had purchased about 6 of them through us and we installed them with no issues. 

About a week or two after the install, one of the users reported they were randomly loosing their mouse. Someone was sent on site  to troubleshoot. This occurred multiple times over the course of a month or so. Each time the standard troubleshooting was done and the next step beyond each time. Some of what was done; replace the mouse a few times, reinstall mouse drivers a few times, reinstall the OS at least twice, replace the mother board, until we replaced the entire PC and still randomly lost the mouse function. 

We were at our wits end and out of ideas. We were baffled how we could replace the entire pc and still have the same issue. We were beginning to they the user was being haunted. One of our employees who did software support mostly chimed in and asked if we knew about the FCC label. The wat? He stated nearly every device that emits signals gets FCC approval. Now back then there were no wireless mice, just wired mice so we were still confused. He clarified we need to look at what's around the PC that could be causing EMF interference. 

On the next visit when the issue was reported, I looked at his desk. I see the mouse cable going from the back to the right side of the pc to the front. On the right of the PC is his phone, and within a couple of inches of the PC. An old style that was likely installed back in the late 70s, or early 80s. I asked him if he noticed the problem seem to occur after his phone rings. He says, well sometimes, but most times it does not happen after his phone rings. 

I made the simple change of moving his mouse cable from the right side to the left side and then between his pc and keyboard so it could be on the right of the keyboard again, but still several inches away from the phone. And as an extra measure moved his phone away more. 

I check back every couple of days and after 2 weeks, he has no issue with his mouse. This lesson became my mantra for troubleshooting. When all else is eliminated, look at the environment. 

tl:dr Old desk phone causes interference for a wired mouse.",1,1623801106
2716,It feels like the first time,"This is a kind of introductory post to serve as a foundation for some stories that involve dealing with lost, left behind, and neglected electronic goods of all shapes and sizes. My position is a non-customer facing one in a retail environment, and though it's not the formal job description, in most stores it's understood to be the in-house broken stuff fixer. Most of what I do that's IT related is troubleshoot malfunctioning equipment such as registers, computers, and printers, and call the IT helpdesk for replacements under warranty or more complicated solutions like anything that requires programming or administrator access (am I a glorified user?).

My previous store had been kept in tip-top shape for 20+ years by my counterpart (I was only part-time there) but she taught me almost everything I know, and the dedicated IT for that district (current district has no such thing, sadly) said our store was one of the best she'd seen, that other stores had non-working registers with scrapped parts and no logs for troubleshooting or replacements with what looked like years of neglect. In the store I was now transferring to, I'd realize exactly what was meant by that...

Before my first day, I got a call asking me if I would do this off-the-floor position full-time instead of the previously discussed sales position, as their current associate just put their notice in (uh oh). Being a simple sales associate had an air of romance about it that I had been looking forward to, but given my experiences over the last few years it felt like my professional duty to help them out of a tight spot, so I agreed. I had some time before my soon-to-be-predecessor's last day so I could observe and learn the nuances of their store. It was a complete 180 from everything I knew, and I must have looked truly horrified because even with a mask on, people were asking me ""Are you all right?"" I'll spare you the non-IT details, but my first few weeks were largely focused on correcting a lot of standard practices that were not being followed, for sake of not getting fired if basically anyone decided to do an audit. One of the very first things I did do though was a quick sweep across the front end to identify and put in tickets for any non-working scan guns, pinpads, printers, cash registers, etc. This turned out to be a good decision because it earned me instant rep as someone dependable among the associates who had been putting up with issues for years.

Once I became familiar with the new environment and more fluid with my basic tasking, I had enough free time to start deep diving a bit. My office is through the server room and a small closet type thing, both of which were filled to the brim with boxes, some of them with shipping labels going back to 2018 and notes that say ""HOLD FOR TECHNICIAN"", but most of it just unlabeled random electronic components for POS systems. Additionally, nooks across the front end had similar electronics haphazardly thrown into opaque plastic totes on shelves. Registers that had been scrapped for parts when others broke were being used as desks, and all registers working and non-working had multiple drawers being used for hoarding-level storage as well. It was like a junk drawer, but the whole store was the drawer. After asking my new supervisor if I could consolidate everything in my office, I got to work decluttering and reorganizing. Putting replacement cables into labeled envelopes was easy enough (I threw away any that were used... I had dozens) but piles of scan guns and pinpads in boxes with fallen-off sticky notes that just say ""BROKEN"" were going to take a little longer and went into clear plastic totes for later troubleshooting. It was long road ahead, but nothing I was doing could make it any worse. Sometimes I wonder how many thousands of dollars the store lost in warranty replacements not sent back over two years, or more.

No matter how exhaustively I search, to this day, the occasional thing from the before time is appearing out of nowhere. Most of the stories I have that are centered around a single incident are to do with said appearing things, particularly the ones that are large in scope or endlessly problematic. I hope you enjoy my stories to come as much as I enjoy recounting them.",1,1623798895
2717,"The Mysterious Tale of the Slow Mice, or how I ""solved"" a decades old problem","This happened a few years ago, when I was working as a middle manager at a small factory. Having previously worked in tech support, I was the go-to guy for everything IT-related. You know how it goes.

We were using this old ERM and process planning software that were most recently updated in 1991, which we accessed through some custom purpose-built terminal emulator applications (on Windows). Picture light grey and blue in the classic IBM 3270 font. Not all my colleagues would agree, but it was actually pretty nice working almost exclusively using the keyboard and the only thing holding you back were how fast you could fly through the different keybinds.

When you worked there for a while you developed this intimate relationship with the software and the screens were just flickering with the speed at which you were doing things. It was especially a challenge training new people as everything was just muscle memory by that point, and slowing down enough to make it possible to see what's going on was surprisingly grueling work.

My point is: *any slight delay in the response of the application stood out like a slap in the face*.

That's why this bug was so annoying. Sometimes, for some more than others, a 2-4 second delay would occur. The whole application would freeze, all keypresses queued up for then to be executed in the same timing as they were entered a few seconds later. This ""timewarp"" effect would linger for a long time, basically having you see the screen 2-4 seconds in the past, or typing 2-4 seconds into the future depending on your perspective. ***This sucked.*** What made it weird was how this also happened to the mouse, but OS-wide (unlike the keyboard delay), effectively ruling out network issues (which had been extensively tested and investigated). This was really interesting, so I told people to tell me whenever they had this problem, to just let go of the mouse+kb and come get me.

The recommended solution was to just restart the application, after finishing whatever lengthy process you were in the middle of, and it would usually go away. *Usually,* which was intriguing. If it didn't work, you disconnected and reconnected any monitors, changed the mouse or keyboard, going from HDMI -&gt; DVI -&gt; VGA and back, connect or disconnect from docking station, and any one of those could randomly solve the problem. It was not performance related either, and the range software was extremely limited with any discrepancies easy to single out.

Out of any clues or consistent behavior apart from the stuff above, and to rule out any weird local electrical issue or something I contacted other branches and asked if they also had that issue. They had, perhaps to a less extent than us, but it was definitely a frequent annoyance they had just lived with for as long as they could remember. This made me lose hope and I gave up looking...

*Until one faithful day.* I was talking on the phone and just clicking stuff on the desktop absentmindedly and the mouse suddenly started lagging behind! This had never happened before, it was always while you were actively using the terminal emulator, typing. I realized I had moved the application window a tiny bit, so that the window border was visible by a few pixels on the second monitor. Moving the window back to only be visible on the first monitor, and the delay was gone. **EUREKA!**

Turns out the input handling part of the application would ""panic"" if less than a column of symbols from the terminal emulator was visible on a second monitor, or outside the area of a single desktop. If you went over 1 column of symbols, the delay would disappear. The reason our ""fixes"" from above worked came from windows often moving a little when resolution or desktop layout changes and when explorer switches graphical mode for a split second. It also came from the instinct to move windows around or draw rectangles on the desktop when you reconnect a mouse to see if it's working... This application was always in window mode so it was always ""at risk"" of being moved.

We never got to know the details of the bug as this was barely being maintained and soon to be phased out, which sucks. I suspect it had something to do with the symbols of the status bar of the application, as this bug only initiated while on subscreens and not on the root menu, but that's just guessing. No way to know now.

**TL;DR**

But this.... this was the one where my headache reached its peak.... A genuine question, from an actual person, who is out there somewhere in the wild...

""I forgot my password, and also, how exactly is my name spelled?""

\*At this point, our hero starts questioning if he is having a fever dream...\*

""You can reset your password HERE, and regarding your name, check your ID....""

&amp;#x200B;

This one possibly tops the previous record holder, who was entirely unsure if they had a third name or not.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: To be clear, he almost certainly meant his actual name, unless he not only does not know what a username is, but specifically used a word to indicate real name by mistake. Also, I meant his actual ID that the government gives, not a company ID or anything.",1,1623778667
2721,You want a new password?,"So, back when I was doing Help Desk at the start of my IT Career \[probably 3-4 years ago\] I worked at a Software company for Accounting purposes. This one person locked themselves out of their account and I navigated to the Software Reset link \[we couldn't directly change it ourselves\]. However, we could see that later. 

Essentially, the account they locked themselves out o had their download links and various other hyperlinks to their licensing and continuing education. So, say your version of MalawareBytes /Norton has decided to 'Quarantine' your files and you deprecated them? You guessed it. You have to re-download using this portal. You need to be reminded of what the most used calculations are for the State of Iowa? You got it. This portal was a god-send. It pretty much hand-held how to use our software and how to download it.

So, back to the story:  I got this older guy. Let's call him Fred. It was an hour until close. He locked himself out of his account. So, me being the patient and caring person I am, walked him through resetting his password. To put it in perspective, I was spoon-feeding this guy how to use a computer.

Me: So, take your mouse and hover the pointer over to where it says 'Forgot Password'. 

Fred: What's a mouse? I don't see that. 

\*Sigh\* 

Me: You know that bulging thing you use to make the white pointer or hand move accross a screen? That'sa  mouse.

Fred: \*Sound of deep understanding\* ""Ohhhhhhh. ""

So, queue more of that ridiculousness. This dude wasn't even on the right page. 'His Secretary always has it open for him'. The whole nine. This dude didn't even know that there were other browsers than Internet Explorer. Like, dude, it's 2015. How the absolute F do you not know about AT LEAST Google Chrome?

Finally, I get to the point. I tried to have him login but he still can't remember. I get a lockout notification. So, I navigate him to the 'Forgot Password' option. This guy went away for 5 minutes to find a random sticky note for his Username. Finally, he gets it but he can't remember how to answer his security questions. 

I ask a slew of them \[6 random ones \[3 actual questions and 3 not real questions\]. He answered all the Security Questions right so, I told him I could do the prompts for him. So, I tell him to go to his email and use the link to navigate to where he needed to go. There he could set his password to what he *thinks* it is. 

By this point, it is 5 minutes to close. This dude has been on the phone with me for an hour \[we weren't allowed to remote to PC's; some federal government privacy rule\]. So, he goes to his email:

Fred: Okay I'm here. 

Me: Okay, do you see the email from [support@myCompany.com](mailto:support@myCompany.com)?

Fred: Yeah. Okay. I'm going to have you do it for me. 

Me: I cannot do that. 

Fred: Yes you can.

Me: Sir, I can't do that.

\*So, old Man-Karen Fred asks in a slew of cursing to speak to my manager.\*

I ping to my manager what is going on and signal for him to jump on. He gives me a sigh and pings me back saying:

*'Okay, he thinks we can change it for him? Let him believe it.'*

My Manager \[Zack\]: 'Hi, yes, I'm Zack, the Manger here. We are changing your password for you. However, we'll have to encrypt your password, so it gets to your side is that okay?""

Fred: ""Yes! This is absolutely ridiculous. You should have done that an hour ago.""

Me: \*Facepalm at Fred\* Okay Fred, so you should see an email come through in just a moment from [JoNyeTheITGuy@myCompany.com](mailto:JoNyeTheITGuy@myCompany.com). You can try copy pasting it.

So, my manager goes through the process of him copy/pasting it. \[By this point, we are at 25 minutes past closing\].

Fred: ""IT'S NOT WORKING!"" \*cure more barrage of irritation\*

Me &amp; Zack: ""We know."" 

Fred: ""Then, why do that?!""

Us: ""Maybe next time you'll listen to what we are saying.""

Zack: ""That being said: It's about 30 minutes post-closing. I suggest you call back tomorrow or follow the link as we suggested. Bye now.""",1,1623775458
2722,We need you to tell us our current password. No not reset tell us. We must have that exact password.,"For backstory i worked for a small tech company. Our largest client was a national franchise so effectively a group of small businesses. Each site was its own franchise but some sites were in their own groups.

A few years prior HO had a very basic software and alot of franchises had their own. When we came on the scene these systems were intergrated into ours by the franchises, mostly using our apis, often badly.

When we first rolled out we were fairly immature company and lacked alot of best pratice guidelines, including how passwords are assigned. (new passwords were all the same (think ""changeme"") and users should change this but at that time we didnt have any enforcement of that.

One unassuming Tuesday our tech support team receives a request to retrive a password. We explain they can reset it automatically but thats not what they want. They want us to tell them their password. Our tech guy explains why we cant do this and ends the call.

We get another call from the same user 20 minutes later asking the same thing. Unfortunately for them we are a small team so it goes to the same tech and he reiterates what he said before and the call ends.

10 minutes later we get a call from the users manager, turns out they use the account for lots of users, not all present and that it had previously been saved on all their browsers. We explain that whilst that sucks, theres f all we can do and besides, each user should have their own account.

The convo got a bit heated but the call ends and thats that, or so we think. Around lunchtime we get a call from one of the senior guys at HO, who asks us the exact same thing.

Were obviously annoyed that they keep on trying to pull rank and that noone seems to care about security but we listen and he drops a bombshell on us.

They dont actually use our software but a series of their own, both developed in house and bought and stitched together. Their only use for us is to transfer data from HO into their own systems and vice versa. The users with access only use it for more manual tasks and one specifc customer query. 

The account in question is used by 8 different applications and its details are hardcoded into the calls. Their only developer is off on a 5 week gaunt in the aussie outback and is completely unreachable. 

Changing this password would send their business back to the 80s, effectively killing these sites completely. Even lending a dev wouldnt help as their gallivanting dev is the only one with access. 

Alot of back and forth goes on and we get a senior dev onto the call to explain how we cant access these passwords etc and more talking in the office about it. Dev gets annoyed at me and shows me the database. Thats the passwords all encrypted looking. 

As he scrolls we notice something. Alot of the entries look identical (we werent salting them?) including the account in question. 

Thats when it dawns on us. 

They never changed the password from the default. A quick login attempt validates this and we give our conclusion to the client and to HO. HO also gets an (absolutely deserved) earful about security and ensuring their sites follow policies from our ceo who is not happy half his company has been dealing with this bullshit for the best part of the day. 

In some ways its an utter miracle noone got into their systems. That same password had been sent to tens of thousands of users on our first rollout before we changed the process (randomly generated single use password) 

You only needed the email address to get in and that was literally sitename@companyname.com

2723,User needs help not having to do her job?,"I get a call from a user telling me that she's got an issue with her computer locking her out every 15 minutes. She's your average non-IT savvy user so I'm going through the usual open and closed ended questions trying to work out if I'm checking her active directory account, her VIP access credentials, or if her citrix desktop is timing out sooner than the usual 30 minute idle time.

Turns out it's none of them - she means her auto PC lock.

I ask her why she wants to change that, and turns out she's working for the evening in some capacity that requires her to monitor a queue, but it's at night and she - in her own words - ""don't want to have to press a button every 10-15 minutes to stop the computer locking.""

So I ask her why she would need to do that - just working would prevent that from being needed? She'd just need to unlock the PC after breaks, surely? She says no, she just wants to be able to go into the other room and watch TV and just check on it on occasion.

Now, without telling a user to suck it up and just do what they're paid to do, how to you communicate that sentiment?

I politely tell her that we really can't change the setting because it's set by corporate policy. I explain it's a security measure that provides a first line of defense against unauthorised access if her laptop gets stolen. I ask if she has other work to do between that time and 8pm to keep her PC unlocked - she claims there's not.

I suggest ""Usually when we're bored on weekends, we find work to occupy ourselves or ask the boss what needs doing over the weekend since we're being paid to work.""

2724,What's a handover?,"Throwaway just in case.

Was contracted to a private firm as desktop support technician with 7 years experience, because the three people that were IT management and help desk left halfway through an Azure migration. I had 2 weeks for the poorly managed and dated environment to be handed over to me, which isn't enough time, but I drew out as much blood from the stone as I could.

Spend the next 5 months with the other first time help desk guy (who absolutely SHINES in the mess he's been dropped in) taking advantage of the lack of change management to implement security procedures, implement day to day operating procedures, implement Zendesk, manage autopilot config, deploying laptops to people that didn't have them so we could finish the migration... And then implemented a change management process as the new management started bringing in contractors to patch up some higher level stuff. All of this was METICULOUSLY documented. During this time I discover my love for azure and implementing change.

The new management had a financial background and we're making nepotism hires left and right, and completely rearchitecting the plans that were laid out for the migration we were halfway through. The entire time they were grateful for what I was doing and ""definitely"" had a role waiting for the both of the help desk team at the end of everything.

Come the end of everything I get a call from my contractor guy saying ""they're swapping providers, so we'll probably get an extra 2 months after the end of your contact to hand over to the new dudes.""
Next day they let me know that my contact isn't being renewed at all, and that the handover will happen in my last week. I ask if they think that's enough time, and they smile and nod.

4 days remain, the new guy comes in from the new contractors and asks approximately 0 questions. He had a years experience in support somewhere else, but before that was working in a bar. I show him my documentation, show him the important systems, he has 0 azure experience... I try my best, I swear to God. Every time I walk in for those 4 days he's watching guitar videos on YouTube and looking at the Zendesk Guide page which isn't applicable to any day to day operations (it's full of user focused documentation for stuff like how to reset your dock).

Last day rolls around, still no questions... At this point I've switched off, my tickets are up to date, but I give him every opportunity to ask ANYTHING.

My counterpart who's contact finishes a month after mine recognizes his value as the only person who now understands how the environment is run and I push him to ask for a payrise before signing a new contract. They offer a pittance and he tenders his resignation so he can leave 4 days earlier than if he just runs out the contract, just to rub dirt in the wound of their poor choices.

Next week I hear that the remote desktop finance is run from goes down for the entire week. Tickets that are normally split evenly between the two on the desk are now weighed 50:5 on the new guys side, which is bizarre because we maintained a maximum of 20 at all times.

The nail in the coffin for me was [vendor] calling me today to ask what the fuck was happening there, they asked new guy to check if an AP was plugged in and he responded ""this has already been logged with [vendor]."" I let him know it's out of my control but I tried my best.

Meanwhile, I found a temporary level 1 role with level 3 pay while I use my free time to collect a few azure certs so I can pursue my newfound love of azure cloud management.

Got my buddy in the role in touch with a recruitment agent who is offering pay that is in line with what he's worth.

Still got a few contacts inside to keep me updated beyond that...",1,1623741184

I asked him if he had an appointment and he said no, he just told me about how he ""had cancer"" and ""almost passed out waiting for us."" I hadn't been properly trained just yet and so asked one of my higher-ups to take care of him.

I overheard the conversation that ensued, and the man said again that he had cancer and almost passed out waiting, but my higher-up saw through him and said that if he's prone to passing out simply sitting and waiting, then that's an urgent medical issue and he should see a doctor, as a tech store is the last place he wants to be if he does pass out.

So because I would like to think I’m somewhat tech savvy I ask what the problem was. He says, “the computer has been on a blue screen all day, I immediately assume our system is dead until I check the main terminal’s screen, it turns out that my manager decided that the best time to do a massive backlog of windows updates was in the middle of the day on a Saturday. So in short that’s how we lost hundreds of dollars in revenue because my older manager decided it was update time.",1,1623603070
2729,Angry woman´s internet misteriously stopped working,"|NOT MY STORY BUT MY INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDER´S|

I will translate to english so please excuse any misspeling or other grammar errors.  


W - Woman  
ISP- Internet service provider  


I like my job, Im happy with it, just like i am with our clients, but sometimes people discourage me from it just like this lady today. Its a saturday afternoon and i got another phone call. I pick it up and im instantly being yelled.  


W - Internet is not working go and do something about it!

ISP - Im not at my desk and i dont know about any problem.

W - I pay my internet and so i want it to be working right now! What am I supposed to do with my child? Stare into wall?!

ISP - What tariff do you have?

W - The cheapest one for 250 Crowns (12 USD/10€).

ISP -  Well with this tariff you have to wait until Monday because the tech support is not included in that one but if you cant be without internet i can send a technician which you will have to pay for.

W - (Now extremely pissed off) I wont pay anything, i pay 250 Crowns for internet. My last provider was free 24/7, didnt want me to pay anything and whats more everything can be fixed on long distances!

In the meantime W was taking another breath

ISP - Not everything can be fixed on long distances and if you want a 24/7 service you need to have the 500 Crowns tariff, if that would be the case there is no problem to come  even at 4AM

Needless to say she didnt care about that and insisted that shes right.

W - I pay 8 Crowns per day so you will do exacly as i say!

There was no point in arguing so i turned on my mobile data and tried to find out whats the problem and what a suprise. She is jumping like an old scratch from a box even tho she didnt pay. You would think that maybe she excused after i informed her about it but no, on the contrary i got even more yelling.

W - Its not my problem that youre incompetent. My paycheck arrives on 15th and every normal company want the bills payed by 20th. 

ISP - You have to pay it by the day you were connected.

W - I dont care. Im getting a new provider by Monday.

Sure.. a provider that will tolerate not being paid and being yelled at because the internet isnt working. If shes not getting a new one by Monday the contract will be terminated by us. I like our clients, Im willing to do many things for them but everything has its limits.

&amp;#x200B;

And just to bring a little light to it, this provider is well known in the town and is even in the town council :D I just wish good luck to the woman because as far as i know there are only 4 providers including the one above :D",1,1623598806

2731,“You mean I don’t have to replace the batteries?”,"I love my elderly paternal grandma. I really, really do. 

It’s just really, really hard not to laugh out loud when these things happen. 

So a few days ago I was able to see my paternal grandparents again, and we gifted them each a iPhone so we could FaceTime with them (we’ve had issues with mail thieves so weren’t taking chances), to replace their old flip phones. We walked them through the new phones, helped pre-load some helpful apps, and run through FaceTime with them. 

Yesterday my grandma stopped by, looking confused. I was the only one home so I got to have this first hand experience. 

Grandma: Epic, I need help. 

Me: With what grandma?

Grandma (pulls out phone): Replacing my phone battery. 

Me: (stares) …What?

Grandma: My phone died. I need help to put in new batteries. I can’t open the case. 

I kid you not, she pulled out a pair of triple As. 

At this point I realized what was going on and had to hold in my laughter. 

Me: G-Grandma you don’t n-need to replace the batteries!

Grandma was getting a little miffed when I had to fight laughing, but let me lead her over to a charging cable. She was really confused as I plugged in her phone into my charging cable…

The look on her face when her phone powered on was *priceless*. Then embarrassed when I explained to her about how the phone needs to be plugged into charging cables to recharge. 

Grandma: Oh… so like rechargeable batteries? 

Me (finally knowing it’s safe to laugh): Yes grandma!

That day I introduced my grandmother to the concept of never having to change batteries. But I’m not going to teach her about the wireless stuff: she still thinks that it’s impossible. 

Grandma, I love you! But sometimes, you can be a bit daft.",1,1623571804

My father's ancient bar phone finally died (battery won't hold a charge), so for some reason he decided to buy a smart phone.  Without consulting me, the person who is expected to fix all things he deems IT related.

Dad: ""\[IchMagKartoffeln\], can you come give me a hand with my new phone?""

Me: ""What new phone?""

Dad: ""My new phone I bought yesterday.""  Proudly shows off said device.

I decided to skip telling him off for buying it without asking me, because he's never listened before -- why would he start now?

Me: ""Ooookay.  What's up with it?""

Dad: ""I just downloaded an app, and now I can't find it.  I've tried EVERYTHING!""

The phone was thrust into my hands.  I stared at an Android system far newer than anything I've encountered.

Me, internal monologue: ""*I have NFI how this works.*  \[And I can't see what's on the screen very well because I'm colourblind and the background image is making things hard to read\] *But I don't think I can break anything unless I really try.  Guess I'll just start in one corner and randomly press buttons until I figure it out*.""

Click on first icon.  Lo and behold!  There's the app.

Dad, watching over my shoulder: ""How did you do that?  I clicked on EVERYTHING and it didn't do that for me!""

Me, while adding the app to his homescreen:  ""Clearly you didn't try everything, or you would have found the app.  Was there anything else?""

Dad:  ""No.  Thanks for fixing that.""

2735,Dear Old Dad and the External Drive,"Hello TFTS, long time no see! I know it's been ages since I've been here, but this just happened, and I've got to share it.

So here it is, a nice hot day, and I'm chilling in my air conditioned house, setting up my shiny new mechanical keyboard and gaming mouse, when my Dear old Dad whines from the next room:

&gt; ""My external hard drive isn't showing up!""

I tell my computer to NOT restart to finish installing drivers for the mouse, thank you very much and holler back. &gt; ""Did you plug it in? Is the USB plug all the way in? Is the power light on? Is the disk spinning?""

See, some months ago, Dear Old Dad complained that his old 200GB drive that he's had for years was filling up, and he wanted a new one with more space. I advised him to do what I did and buy a 1TB, 3.5 inch drive and slap it in an external enclosure. Boom, all the space you need. I told him what to get, he did exactly that, and I hadn't heard anything else about it until he whined about it not showing up.

His computer is 10 years old and somehow still alive. The damned thing has outlived my old gaming PC, which *is* still alive, but it's performance deteriorated to the point I quit using it and built a new one last summer. His computer is so bad that he wants my old one, because it still runs better, despite the fact that games like Chasm suffer from old school NES type slowdown on it. (I actually found and fixed the reason for that, but he doesn't know that.)

Yeah, his computer is crap. 

Anyway, suspecting that the aforementioned crap computer is why his drive isn't showing up - dying USB ports, Windows being stupid, etc - I tell him to eject the drive and bring it to me. If my shiny new - well not quite new but new enough - computer has a problem, then there is 100% an issue with the drive. 

I plug everything in, power it up, the drive spins up, and nothing happens. No external drive pops up in This PC. Huh. I try multiple USB ports. Nothing. Weird. I check Device Manager. There it is. DM sees *something* there, but isn't quite sure what it is. I finally open Disk Management. There is my internal drive with its healthy partitions, and below that is a drive that is not initialized. 

Ooooooh crap. Initializing the disk won't erase data, but reformatting certainly will. I do some Google Fu to see if I have any other options, and everything comes back to ""Reformat the disk"" which I can't do, because I don't know what all he's saved on the disk already. The only other thing I can find is expensive data recovery options, and screw that. This is why I have two external drives for myself. 

Anyway, after 20 or so minutes, I call him in and ask if there is anything on this disk that absolutely cannot be replaced, because the only option is to reformat. 

He blinks at me. &gt; ""There's nothing on the disk.""

&gt; ""There won't be, after I reformat it.""

&gt; ""No, I never put anything on it. It was never used. I was trying to use it when it didn't show up.""

I let out a ""What?"" so flat it was practically 2D. He walks out of the room then, and my brain finally catches up to itself.

&gt; ""You mean to to tell me that you've had this thing for months, and you've never attempted to use it yet!""

&gt; ""Oh, I never got around to it. Is it screwed up really bad?""

I nearly slam my head down on my new keyboard. &gt; ""It's fine! It's not showing up because it was never formatted! You have to format new disks before you can use them!""

&gt; ""Oh, it didn't tell me that.""

&gt; ""No, because you're supposed to *read the instructions* which will tell you to do that. Or you could have just told me at the beginning, and I could have done it on your computer and saved myself the trouble.""

I initialize and format the disk, and BAM! There it is: DoD's Drive: F. Yay! I eject it,  unplug everything and hand it to him. &gt; ""Make sure you eject it before you unplug it. I won't save you if you corrupt your files. Don't jostle it while it's spinning either. You're screwed if you head crash it.""

He promptly takes it to his own computer - and sits it on his desk and wanders off to do something else. I shut my door and huddle down with my hardware and grumble about computer illiterates that remain so despite using computers for years.

TLDR: Dear old dad buys an 3.5 inch drive and puts it in an enclosure to use as his new external drive. He never actually attempts to use it, complains that it's not working, and then doesn't bother to tell me that when I try to troubleshoot it.",1,1623532859

Finally I agreed to come over and take a look.... everything looked normal, no shorts between power and data pins or anything bad like that. I took a look inside the case and found... That the USB 2.0 internal plug was jammed into the fucking COM header... meaning every time he plugged something in, He was sending 12v signals down both power and data lines of the USB device. I have never seen something like this happen before, and I have no clue how it managed to pass QC at the factory.  Especially considering it had completely mangled up one of the pins of the com header, which seems as though it would take a lot of force. I tested all the devices that had plugged in to the bad ports, I found that it had completely killed a 64gb flash drive, wireless mouse transceiver, and an external optical drive. I also tested the (somewhat high end) mechanical keyboard that he had plugged in, I tried on both usb and through the ps/2 adapter and while it worked, it was not sending the proper keys at all and also seems to be useless as a brick now.

2747,Just some old recordings...,"First time posting here.

I work for a company that specializes in CRM application, but that wasn't the case from the beginning. 

The company started by developing applications for Windows Phone based devices (the original smartphones and PDAs running Windows), such as custom keyboards (which were customizable - something unheard of in that time), advanced file manager, few games and audio recorder, which is the star of this story. 

This recorder supported your usual formats, like mp3, wav, etc. but also our proprietary recording format which offered goodcompression (which was important in those times as storage was small and expensive for mobile devices) while maintaining good audio quality.

Now, 16 years after the app has been published and quite a few years after the official support was dropped, we received a support request from a guy, asking us if it is possible to convert some recordings from our format to mp3. We explained that there is no converter, but that what he can do is install a Windows Phone emulator and install the application, which we sent him. We also included the steps on how to export the recordings into different format (let me tell you, seeing Windows Phone 6.5 was a trip down the memory lane). 

And we thought nothing of it, just a support request for an application that has been dead for a long time. We weren't sure if he would manage to succeed. But then his reply arrived.

He managed to successfully export the recording to mp3 and they were intact. He also revealed, that they were recording of his son from a very young age and he valued them greatly, as he cherished those moments of easier life.

Let me tell you, there have been many moments when we felt good that we managed to solve a problem for our customer, but this has taken it to another level. Just thinking that there is a guy with a son, that is probably going to college, and we manage to uncover reminders of the past that he presumed were lost warms our hearts.

I used to work at a prestigious private school that had a pretty big campus - approximately 45 acres - that was a hassle to get around. It also didn't help that the school was built on basically a cliff. Anyway, I get a phone call from one of our PDHPE teachers saying that her wireless mouse isn't working and that I need to run over a couple new batteries for her ASAP. To make matters worse she is preparing for a parent presentation and she is upset this might make her look bad.

So I grab the batteries and start the long jog over. Now I'm not athletic at all so I was buggered by the time I arrived at the sports pavilion. I climb the stairs - my worst enemy - and enter the room huffing, she sees me and says ""Look, it's not working"", moving the so-called mouse. Dumbfounded, I just stare at her in full deadpan mode and reply, ""That's cause you are holding a whiteboard duster"". It was at this moment that two things happened, the first was one of our technology teachers had just walked in and witnessed the spectacle. She was on the floor in hysterics laughing her ass off. The second was I realised Holly from Red Dwarf was so right in his assessment of PE teachers.

I found the wireless mouse and it was working fine. I left the room and told no-one what had happened, yet within an hour the whole school knew what had transpired. 

That PE teacher resigned a week later. I surely hope they have increased their IQ from 0.5 but It's unlikely.

2757,"I Extremely Technologically Illiterate, Therefore It's Your Fault","Hello, fellow techies!

Long time lurker, first time poster.

This happened yesterday, but I'm still fuming just by thinking about it.

I got into a screaming contest with my boss because (as always) her ignorance was somehow my fault.

So, she got a colleague to e-mail me this Excel spreadsheet that she wanted me to burn to a CD, because burning a CD is an extremely complex task and should only be done by rocket scientists with master's degree in nuclear physics.

Yeah, yeah, I know what some of you are thinking: ""Aren't CDs obsolete in 2021?"" Why yes. Yes, they are. But I work in a municipality and where I'm from almost all the public institutions and some of the private ones still use them.

Anyway, I burn the damn CD and give it to my colleague who later gives it to my boss.

Later that day I'm in the deputy mayor's office, doing something else when my boss comes to that office several times for different reasons (so now she knows where I am).

Just when my work there is done and I open the door to leave, I see my boss who was about to enter, holding the pieces of a broken CD in her hands.

Boss: IT'S A GOOD THING I CHECK EVERYTHING! HOW COULD YOU SCREW UP *THIS* BADLY?! INSTEAD OF THE FILE YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO, YOU BURNED &lt;small town mayor's name&gt;'S DECLARATION OF PROPERTY.

A little backstory: Since we work in the public sector, recently we all had to fill out a declaration where we declare (duh) all the properties (house(s), apartment(s), car(s), etc.) that we own. We do this once every year. So since we are a municipality, we have a bunch of small towns surrounding our city. Their town halls are kinda like our subsidiaries. So the files she was referring to were two files that were the declaration of the mayor of one of these towns. Back to the screaming contest:

Me: I KNOW WHAT I BURNED! YOU THINK I'M BLIND?! THOSE FILES AREN'T ANYWHERE NEAR THE SAME FOLDER AS THE ONE I BURNED THIS MORNING!

Boss: DON'T LIE TO ME! I SAW THEM WITH MY OWN EYES! I BROKE THE CD BECAUSE IT'S USELESS NOW.

Me: THOSE FILES WEREN'T ON THE CD! COME WITH ME TO YOUR OFFICE AND I'LL SHOW YOU! IF YOU HADN'T BROKEN THE CD, I COULD ALSO SHOW YOU THE *REAL* FILE ON IT.

We go to her office, while screaming at the top of our lungs on the way there.

Boss: WHY ARE YOU STILL HERE?! GO TO YOUR OFFICE AND BURN ANOTHER CD WITH THE RIGHT FILE THIS TIME!

Me: I'M HERE BECAUSE YOU ARE ACCUSING ME OF SOMETHING I DIDN'T DO! GO ON, OPEN YOUR OPTICAL DEVICE! SEE? THE CD IS OUT YET THOSE FILES ARE STILL HERE. AND LOOK WHAT IT SAYS ABOVE THEM - ""Files Ready to Be Written to the Disc"".

Boss: SO? WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?!

Me: EXACTLY WHAT IT SAYS. THOSE FILES ARE READY TO BE WRITTEN TO A DISC BUT THEY ARE NOT WRITTEN. THEY ARE ON YOUR COMPUTER, NOT ON THE DISC.

Boss: AND WHERE WAS THE CORRECT FILE THEN?!

Me: YOU BROKE THE CD, SO I CAN'T SHOW YOU.

We exchange some more ""pleasantries"" and I go to my office to burn her another CD. I bring it to her and I stay in the room to see her opening it with my own eyes. She puts the CD in and immediately goes to the optical device while the disc is still spinning. The two files from the declaration are still there.

Me: Delete these files already!

Boss: How?

Me: Like any other file. I told you, they are not on the CD, they are on your computer.

She deletes the files, however not only is Windows Explorer not showing the file I just burned to the CD, but it actually ejects the tray with the disc. She takes it out and just as she's about to mouth off to me again, I notice she's holding it kinda strange.

Me: Wait a minute! Is that the way you put it in the tray?

Boss: Yeah.

Me: Pffff! Flip it over. The label should be on the outside while the shiny side should be on the inside (her case is small, so the optical device is installed vertically, rather than horizontally).

She does as I say, then she puts the CD back in and lo and behold the file is there in all its glory.

Boss: Does that mean I've been putting the other CD in the wrong way too? And that's why I didn't see the file?

Me: (with annoyed sigh) Probably.

I didn't get anything resembling an apology, let alone an actual apology. She just awkwardly laughed a few times afterwards, in an attempt to make me laugh with her, but I was waaaay too pissed for that.

And another thing that boggles the mind is the colleague who sent me the file, then came to my office and was watching me burn it. So according to my boss' logic, we both somehow missed the fact that instead of burning the ONE correct file to a CD, I mistakenly burned TWO incorrect ones.",1,1623221689
2758,Sometimes its what you hear that makes the difference.,"A few years ago I was a senior tech with a popular personal computer company. As a senior tech I dealt with alot of TDD and escalation calls. One day my team lead comes over and puts my phone on 'aux'. Meaning when this call finishes I won't be getting another one. After I complete my call he comes over to my desk.

'Okay, I'm sending you a call from an irate customer'
No shock there
'They have replaced his mouse twice and his pc once. He has just finished his 3rd reload and its still messed up' the team lead explains
'Whats the Actual issue ?"" I ask. 'His cursor is jumping all over the screen when he uses his mouse' the to explains.

So I take the call. First off standard apologies.  Then we go into DM and look for splats. Hes having a hard time negotiating cause the cursor keeps jumping around.no splits. Current driver versions. Reboot into safe mode. Same issues.reboot with mouse out and plug in after. No change.delete mouse drivers disconnect mouse and reboot. Plug in mouse and drivers load. Cursor still jumping all over the screen. 

At this point I'm at a loss. As I'm trying to think what to do next I hear a ""click click click"" from the customers end.
'Whats that sound ?"" I ask 
'Sorry, just tapping my pen on my desk ' he replies.
I can barely suppress the grin on my face. I feel like laughing out loud.
'Do you have a glass desk?"" I ask, although I already know the answer.
'Yes' he replies with frustration in his voice
'Take a peice of printer paper and set your mouse on top of it."" I advise.
'Okay, now what?"" He asks. I can tell he is loosing his patience
'Try using your mouse

A moment later ..

'OH MY GOD YOU FIXED MY COMPUTER! Your a miracle worker.""

I explained that he had an optical mouse and the beam was being scattered by the glass desktop.thars why his cursor was jumping around. All he had to do was put it on something NOT GLASS for it to work properly.",1,1623212624

Me: OK, what have you done?

My wife runs down all the things I would do and it is still not working.

2761,"Interesting Commonality of ""Reply All"" Responders","Our organization uses a ticket tracking system for IT helplines. It allows you to define groups, so each helpline can have one or more groups, to help them organize their tickets.

IT has folks monitoring to see how old tickets get. If you have old tickets in a group you own, you got an e-mail. Now, there's a couple key points:

1. Owning a group doesn't mean you are in the group. You are just responsible for it.
2. The folks who sent the e-mail didn't use bcc: to address it.

I've seen four or so Reply-All responses to that e-mail. The common feature? **""I don't do tickets.""** (Or a reasonable facsimile of that meaning.) Meaning, these are people who aren't doing user support and refuse to be part of user support...but they had to have had some involvement to get the e-mail in the first place, because it was sent to group owners.

I'm guessing we've figured out who the people are who weren't very good at doing tech support.

Bonus: No one else has done a reply-all saying ""don't do reply-all,"" so I'm guessing the real tech people are just working the task. But it is noteworthy that the people who feel compelled to tell everyone something, are all saying they aren't involved in support.",1,1623182550
2762,That's a Beast of a new computer.,"So, I currently work in a call center, and the call center contracts me with other businesses that need help. I can't say who I work for,  but let's just say the IRS is both an asset and an enemy.   


So I am going about my calls today when I receive a call with no account. that is fine, I go through the spiel I usually do, and he goes: ""oh, I don't have an account with you guys."" Okay, I set him up with one, and as I am asking probing questions on his issue today and creating a case, he says ""yeah, I don't know why you guys started to need an internet connection to use your software, but I don't have an internet connection, so I need you to give me a code or some magic jumbo to get the program to work for me."" confused, as I am not aware that there are people out there without an internet connection, I explain how he needs to use the Internet for various functions of the product. he gets upset and annoyed and goes ""well, I guess I will get a new computer with the internet on it. (no I didn't catch that at first) is this going to be something that always happens with the company?"" I answered how anyone else would answer. with everything moving to the cloud, aka the internet, that a lot of your programs and products are using for various features. he reluctantly agrees and then asks what he needs for a new computer. so I gave him minimum requirements:  


Windows 8.1 or newer  
2bg of RAM  
1GB for the program  
5GB for Microsoft .net 5.4.2 or something like that.   
1mbs for internet  
The program needs admin rights, especially when printing off documents.   


He sighs, and he goes ""so not only do I have to purchase a computer with the internet (caught it that time, I blinked) but I also have to get this beast of a computer."" I looked at my gaming rig next to me, which 5 years ago cost $800 to $1000. thinking to myself: yeah ... a real beast, I tried to explain to him he would need to call his Internet service provider and get the basic internet, and he should be fine. but he probably didn't understand that either.",1,1623172838

A month ago, she comes back. It starts again.

Today I get a flustered email saying that ""99% of her emails to customers are bouncing back with error messages"" (her words, not mine). This is interesting considering she's never mentioned it the past and none of the other users have reported problems. We've got three different systems that can send emails (company email system, sales system and car manufacturer emails) so I needed to ascertain which system was having problems.

Scoldog: ""Where are you emailing from?""
Idiot: ""My office""

OK, not helpful, but I'm willing to admit the question was misconstrued.

SD: ""What is the email bounce back you are getting?""
I: ""Here it is""

I look at the error message. She's spelt the customers last name, which is part of the email address, wrong.

SD: ""You've spelt the customers last name wrong.""
I: ""But it is happening to all my emails. Here's another one.""

She sends me another bounce back message. The customer sent an email from fnurk@hotmail.com but she changed the customer email address in the sales system to fnurk@gmail.com for some reason.

SD: ""You've changed the domain from hotmail.com to gmail.com""
I: ""........................................Oh God, I'm a d**khead""

Biting my tongue, I say goodbye and hang up on her. I start making up a cuppa for afternoon tea, when I get another call.

I: ""OK, There is something definitely going wrong with this system.. I've double checked this customers email address. It was wrong in the sales system and I had to change it. The customers name is Bob, but someone put it in as Rob. I checked it is correct with the customer then changed it in the sales system, but I still can't email him""

I check. She's changed the username part of the email address from 'rjones' to 'bjones' which is correct from the email he sent her, but she's added a .AU to the end of the domain name (IE rjones@companyname.com got changed to bjones@companyname.com.au)

2768,RMA trainee vs manufacturers support,"I did my unpaid internship (mandatory part of IT studies) at RMA department in medium size IT-wholesale. Even thou we were IT company, we sold everything owners could get deal on; record players, knives, garden shears, you name it. And if it was broken, it went thru our RMA process as any IT stuff would.

Normal RMA process for end user was either send it to store they bought it or straight to us. Stores would send it to us without even looking at it so didn't matter witch way it came. Then we check users description and if we can repeat the problem we start RMA process with manufacturer if not we call the end user and ask more info until we find it faulty or not. When product cames back from manufacturers RMA we check it again before sending it back to end user.

But this story isn't about those random items, it's about ""refurbished"" PCs that was one of our largest product groups. Most of them were refurbished just by name, they had just been lying on larger clients warehouse until sent back to manufacturer and sold to us.

Problem comes with manufacturers RMA, we have to use same numbers and lines as end users so we are treated same way; ""Turn it on and off again, update drivers and Windows, run the diagnostic software"". They especially love that divine diagnostic software. Well time goes on, I call daily to their support, their support personnel becomes more familiar than some workers in our company, I remember their script better than some of them, sometimes I even start going thru it word by word before they can start reading it (yes you could hear that some of them read it from paper). Some of their support personnel were ok knowing I've done everything before calling and some insisted that I do it again now that they have told me to do it. By average, one case took me two calls, first to start the case in their system and second to tell the result of their diagnostic and send it to their RMA. Sometimes it came back fixed, sometimes I had to repeat previous steps and send it back. That's why we always checked it before sending anything back to the end customer.

Well, this one PC.. It just didn't have it. After 15min - 1h usage it would just freeze. Couldn't update drivers or Windows because it froze. Couldn't run diagnostic software because it crashed. It was hardware problem but until diagnostic software says so it wasn't. It took me four days, multiple calls a day, they tried to remote control it to do the updating for me, it froze, they tried to run their other diagnostic tool, it crashed. Some of their support listened what I've done already some didn't (they had their own system where they wrote down everything but for some reason they rarely read it). On fourth day end user had contacted us and asked how long will it take until his computer is fixed, I answer honestly and say that I don't know. He was bit sad but accepted it. I call again to the support, ""maybe this time I can finally send it to their RMA"", I thought. Then I hear her voice, person on other end was one of these who only know how to read the script, nothing else. My next thought was to end the call and try again later but I've never done that and I won't start doing it now. I go on like normal call would, telling her what I've doe etc. but no, she reads the script and asks me to call after I've gone thru those steps.

I'm calm person, during my time there I got all difficult customers because I didn't loose my patience. Well, first time in my life someone found the limit. I didn't yell, I waited till she had finished what she has to say, and then I raised my voice a bit and told her firmly from start to end everything I have done to this PC during those 4 days, results and everything they have tried to do and that at this point restart doesn't help anymore and that it's not software problem and I asked if I just can send it to their RMA so they can handle it because I can't do anything more to it without voiding warranty. When I stopped talking our whole RMA department (so 3 other guys) was silent and even our boss had came from his office to see whats happening. What was her answer? ""You are difficult customer, I have to escalate this case, different department will call you.""

Hour or two later ""Department of difficult customers"" (or whatever the official name is) calls me, nice polite old man, ""I like him"" I thought, and he starts call with words ""I read you case.."" I was just happy to hear that someone in that company can read case file so I don't have to go thru it. Call went well, he told that their support should have given me permission to send the PC to their RMA instantly when diagnostics failed and he will make sure that in the future this wont happen again. It's sweet talk I know but I was ok it doesn't really matter to me as long as I get rid of this case. Then he told he wants to talk to my boss because lately there had been multiple cases where we and other customers have had to send ""fixed"" computers back to their RMA because they hadn't fixed them properly. Next day I heard from my boss that they made nice deal, can't remember details but it was something about some difficult cases going thru us but I never saw this because my internship ended couple weeks after.

Oh did I tell that I was unpaid? Well, because my boss got nice deal from all this, he was generous and bought pizzas to whole department and next summer when I called him for summer job, nope he already had department full of unpaid trainees.",1,1623129997

2770,Nice hot cuppa,"Another story from the depths of time when I was on the helpdesk for an ISP.

For those who don’t remember dial-up was not the fastest medium.

And E-mail accounts using POP3 had this habit that if you did not download all the messages it would start the next session from the beginning again. It needed the confirmation marker to tell it everything had arrived.

So a good number of calls were along the lines of “I keep getting the same email messages”

So I would go in and look at their mailbox and there it was - an Eva I’ll message of substantial size which probably had some pics attached.

So my remedy to the caller was.

Once you have hung up with me! Dial in and start downloading your emails. Once you have started this. Go and make your self a cuppa. The hotter the better. Do not touch the computer until you have finished your cuppa.

Funny enough I got a few return calls saying that this cured the problem.

This particular customer call starts out pretty normal, no internet connection, phone not working, etc, etc... 

I start a test on the line to look for faults but this can take a while so I also check the general setup, asking the customer to confirm what is plugged in and where.

Line test comes back clean apart from not getting a signal back from the router and the setup sounds correct. I even ask the customer outright if there's any signs of damage to anything and he says no. I'm at a loss and leaning towards a fault with the equipment. Just as a last shot, I get the customer to use his mobile to send me a picture.

His router is indeed plugged into the correct phone socket. The socket however is just lying on the floor. There is zero physical connection from the router to the phone line.

Me: ""Is...is that socket actually connected to anything?""

Customer: ""No, it fell off the wall this morning""

Me: ""Well there's the problem. We'll need to send someone to repair the socket otherwise nothing is going to work""

&gt; **Caller**: *I don't know can we just get someone down it's an Execs comptuer?*
&gt; **Me**: *Well I can't really just send someone down without knowing what the issue is, can you just tell me what's happening?*

It's BSOD which may just need updated but asked to further troubleshoot to make sure it isn't hardware.

&gt;**Caller**: *Listen I don't have time to test this, can we just get it fixed it's an execs computer!*

I get his account ID and find service history on multiple systems and it's a mess, everyone who has had him on call has the same story ""It's an execs computer, doesn't explain issue doesn't want to diagnose."" never gets fixed on original visit or case just drags on for days.

As this was the first job we did for the company I get there and they had called their ISP, and they wanted us to setup a PC next to the firewall to see if the FW was the issue. I get forwarded this e-mail chain and see the scope the ISP provided for the test PC.

I set up the PC with the first IP in the scope and start Pingplotter to check for outages etc. As I finish with this the owner of the company storms in.

I start troubleshooting the firewall and many of you might have spotted the problem already.

2779,This is worse than remote troubleshooting without internet,"I worked at an arcade game sales and repair shop for a short time. 

I was told that we had gotten a call that a customer's pinball machine was not ""starting up"" and they'd like to know what to bring. It was a solid state game from around the 90's or so.

I asked what they meant by ""not starting up"" and they said, lights come on but they press start, and the game doesn't actually start. By this point they've already ended the call and scheduled an appointment to go over and ""repair"" it (I use the term loosely) but first, the guys want some idea of where to start.

I ask if the display shows anything or if there was any sound at all. They say, they didn't really ask, but they could tell it was getting power because the customer said the lights were on. 

Side note: Troubleshooting an arcade machine, when it's not the actual motherboard or logic, is more like working on the electrical system of a car than it is working on a computer. The lights that are always on when the machine is on, often run on a separate power supply from the motherboard and are not controlled by it. Therefore, you could have a machine where the actual motherboard isn't getting any power at all, but you can see lights on in the backbox, playfield and the coin slots. 

Back to the story.

I decide to give them a little checklist to run through with the customer, to try and figure out what's likely the cause and figure out whether they need to obtain a service manual / schematics for the game or if the customer already has that available, and what things to just ""automatically"" bring over that aren't necessarily in their ""all purpose"" parts kit (silly me, I assumed they had such a thing at the store :) )

However, the customer service guy states that (customer) owns a business and we just can't call back a guy like that. I clarify to him that \*I\* don't need to interact with the customer directly at all, but this is the info I would need in order to help their ""technicians"" know what to bring, what things to look at first, and the questions I'd be asking the customer, did not involve the customer mucking about with anything inside the machine whatsoever, just exclusively focusing on things he could observe from the outside. Mr Customer Service (not the boss) still insists that we have no further contact with the customer until the technicians get over there.

Needless to say, I told them that I really can't do ""remote"" troubleshooting without any ability to talk to someone that's there. If they wanted me to talk ""through"" someone else, or write an email and have someone ""proofread"" it to make sure their email looks professional and friendly, that's one thing. But I really can't imagine how they expected me to be able to help them with this. The symptoms couldn't even be narrowed down to one board, and even if they could, that wasn't the kind of shotgun solution the owner approved of.",1,1623003628
2780,"If this is some sort of test, I'm not sure what the takeaway was supposed to be.","I worked at a place that, among other things, built a status display / control panel for a larger system. It was built somewhat like a tablet, bearing one ""motherboard"" that had pretty much everything except the cooling fans, display and the actual controls themselves. You might think there's not much to troubleshoot, and if we didn't have microscopes and fine-tip temperature controlled soldering irons available, you'd be correct. 

&amp;#x200B;

These were relatively expensive for what they did, mostly due to more rigorous testings as well as having to comply with more regulations than a consumer device did. They also had to be able to run for very long periods, and thus, brand-new boards along with entire new devices required a ""burn-in"" test. 

Boss walks up to me with a device that has a small nick in the corner of the screen. He says it intermittently gets stripes or lines in the screen, or goes to all one color, I forget what the issue was exactly. I plug it in. Obviously if I can gently press on the screen itself and make the issue come and go, then the issue lies within the LCD panel assembly itself and we would replace that. The LCD panel assembly was made by a third party, so we didn't have all the documentation about the actual internals: just the ""outside"" specs, i.e. power supply requirements, displayable signals and mounting recommendations.

It doesn't react to gentle pressure on the screen. It does have a protective, hard layer over the screen that protects the actual LCD, and it is relatively robust. However, with that in mind, if something does hit it hard enough and/or exactly the wrong way to actually chip or crack it, it's possible the LCD suffered damage as well. 

I mention, without having seen the screen go wrong in front of me, that I suspect the screen itself is intermittent due to physical damage, as I point out the physical damage to it. Boss says ""ignore that"". 

Not bothering to question him, I then go on to detail what I would do if I got this kind of issue with a unit that had no physical damage to the screen. Basically, dismount the front panel but leave the wires connected, and gently move the display signal cable to see what happens. If nothing did happen, I'd check all cooling fans, and if they were okay, run it for an hour. With no confirmation, I'd have the graphics chip reflowed (not replaced unless the reflow process causes it to entirely fail)

Boss says that takes too long, so I mention I could just tap it from the outside without taking it apart, and just leave it on for an hour if I can't make anything happen by tapping the entire thing from the outside. He still doesn't like the idea that it would take an hour to do that. 

I say, if we run the automatic quality test that all units get anyway, if there was an overheating issue of some kind, it would likely show it during that test, so I could just gently tap the whole thing, and if nothing happened, just send it to testing as a no fault found. The QC test auto-checked the input and output connections that would be attached to other devices in a real system, and periodically ""asked"" the operator to verify that all buttons work, and the screen is showing this pattern, does this picture look right, etc. 

He then says we should be able to find that kind of issue here at the bench. So, doing my best not to even accidentally sound like I'm questioning his ""logic"" I essentially ask him, how he would suggest I try to troubleshoot the issue at the bench, as quickly as possible. He then says ""you're the expert, you tell me"". So, I mention that I already told him what I would do to find intermittent issues on the bench. I start mentioning other real cases of problems I found the cause of, and then solved, by doing all these things. Before he can say anything else I continue right into ""but, if you have better ideas as to what I should, or shouldn't, do while I'm working on these, I'm all ears"".

I point out that while I'm letting the unit run for an hour, I can troubleshoot other devices in the meantime, with essentially no slowdown. To validate his time issue, I mention that I could just do the quick checks and just ask him what to do next. To which he replies, he's already here, and so he's asking ME what I should do next. I say I'm out of ideas, he asks ""Why"" and, having no idea what he would want me to say, I pause to think for a moment about a tactful response. 

I just answer the question directly. I said ""I had some ideas, but you said no to all of them, so I didn't argue, and just came up with a different solution""

He not only went off on me for ""blaming"" him for my lack of ability to troubleshoot the device, but also accused me of being ""about to say"" something rude to him but clamming up out of ""fear"" just because I paused. I didn't start speaking in an angry voice and suddenly ""restart"" in a calm voice, I didn't do a last minute ""Spy Kids word replacement"" (Oh shi....take mushrooms) I just paused for a moment before speaking, just to think about previous experience so that I WOULDN'T say something that offended him.

Here's the kicker, I had worked there for several years and had been trained on the device over a year ago, and I had the same boss the entire time. Yet experience with that job under that boss was worse than useless while still working for the same boss at the same job. Ditto for experience with the device itself, at least in the boss's eyes. 

The boss also would question why you were doing things the way the trainer showed you, and didn't like the fact that you trusted your trainer's way of doing things. Even if you'd been doing it that way without problem for over a year. 

Not sure if anyone can relate to a similarly ridiculous experience with this kind of job, but feel free to share your experience below if you do. :)",1,1622992031
2781,"Family tech support - showstopping problem, moronically simple solution","I feel like family tech support is a lot different to professional tech support - not only are you not being paid for it, you're demonstrating to your family that you *understand* *technology*, where they usually don't, and probably that their investment in your education was well-spent.

My family is all over the world. Occasionally, my dad will ask me to buy things from our home country and post them on to him. He's a very big ST:TNG fan (I never was growing up), so I've been trying to share my BR rips of ST:Picard with him. Via any file transfer setup, it's too unstable and always fails. So I figured, I'm sending him a box with his latest purchase anyway, I'll slip one of my spare HDDs in with it. He agrees, I share a list of my Plex library, he sends back a list of what he'd like, I load up a spare 500GB HDD nearly to the brim, carefully bubble-wrap everything and send it on a 10-day journey across the continent.

So last week it arrived, seemingly undamaged. Of course, he has Windows PCs, whereas I'm all on Linux. I made sure to NTFS-format the HDD beforehand, but I'm always apprehensive that Windows will decide not to like the drive - this has happened to me a lot, even on HDDs that were formatted on Windows PCs, and is one of the many reasons I hate the things. Anyway, he hooked it up to his laptop... and Windows asked him to insert a disk into Drive F:. He tries it on his modern Windows 10 laptop, and his old Windows 7 laptop (can't be upgraded because of specialist software, no internet access). Same deal, neither laptop can read the disk.

Okay, so I start running through the possibilities. The drive spun up, so it's intact. So we probably have damaged disk headers, right? Not impossible, the box was probably X-rayed a few times, or Windows has just decided something isn't 100% perfect, maybe it can tell that a filthy Debian server has been writing all this data to its precious NTFS filesystem, so it won't work, thank you. So the best option is to run chkdsk... which leads me back to the first paragraph. My dad is an engineer, but he is NOT a computer engineer. He knows how to use his CAD software, but that's about it. He defers to me to actually make the things work. We both get frustrated when there's a proxy between me and the computer, I need direct access to fix this while keeping my sanity. So I now have the job of somehow getting onto his laptop 5,000 miles away to poke at this HDD and see what the deal is.

First thing I try - Google Hangouts screen-sharing. We video-call quite regularly this way. Of course he only uses Hangouts on his phone, and the camera isn't good enough to make out anything on the screen. So we get him signed in on his laptop... and about 10 seconds into any video call, the video and audio from his end freeze. Multiple attempts, either of us initiating the call, always the same thing. And the screen-share button doesn't work for him, at all, even though it does on my Ubuntu laptop. I think the recent Firefox update has interfered with it.

Okay... before we settled on Hangouts, we used Skype, let's resurrect his old Skype account. This is, of course, when the Skype client on his laptop refuses to open without an update, and then refuses to update. FFS.

Hmm, how about TeamViewer? Seems I have an account from ages past, all right! Login... and get prompted for a 2FA token, and I don't have it set up on my current phone. Oh \*\*\*\*, I seem to have lost the seed. And my recovery codes are nowhere to be found. Frack.

Okay, clutching at straws, we try Zoom. Thankfully both our companies are amenable to allowing personal use of our Zoom accounts. I try to install Zoom on my personal Ubuntu laptop. And it falls flat on its face with QT errors. Yet I use the same client on my work Ubuntu laptop. So I fire that up instead.

Finally, we have a stable video call going. We have a catch-up and talk about various things before turning to the task in hand. Talk about the TV shows and movies he's found on Netflix during lockdown. He mentions a HDD I've sent him before that he's still using - I honestly forgot about it, an old WD Elements, probably 5 or so years ago. So I mention to him that the HDD I sent him this time isn't a ready-made one, it's a USB enclosure containing a laptop HDD.

Lightbulb finally starts glowing.

See, these enclosures I have are great for my use - they're completely toolless and I can pop the disk out of them in seconds. Great for when I'm swapping between SSDs. And to do that, they rely exclusively on the SATA connector to hold the drive in place. And I've just shipped this via parcel post several thousand miles.

Mentally kicking myself, I ask him to unplug the cable, then pop the top cover off the enclosure, revealing the drive itself. Then push the drive firmly in the direction of the USB cable. It engages firmly into the SATA connector. Then plug it in.

USB500GB (F:) : Movies / TV Shows / Music...

I feel stupid now. For once, 'Please insert a disk into drive F:' was a valid error message.",1,1622925715

Social workers are the bane of my existence but you learn to cope with their general incompetence as part of the job. But sometimes they can still surprise you. This happened today.

It's literally written on the walls in most areas, because the only thing it can access is another login page, so it isn't a security issue. Most of these accounts stay logged on at all times to save confusing the geniuses that work here. A guy rang up, said hello and asked for the generic login details.

Genius: so is that the asset number of the PC?

2783,Hey if you don't want your $1000 gaming computer I'll take it,"This happened awhile ago. I own my own computer repair business and a customer called me up asking me to build them a computer, they had all the parts and just wanted someone to put it together as they didn't trust them selves. It was a fairly high end computer, they spent probably $2000+ on parts. I put it together with no issues and they were very happy. When they picked it up they asked if I could fix up one of their older computers so their kids could play together. The computer they brought in was maybe 2-3 years old but for the time was top of the line parts and probably cost $2000-$2500, they bought an Nvidia GTX1070 and told me that it needs a hard drive and some extra fans. So I picked up a $100 hard drive, swapped in the 1070, installed the fans and it ran like a dream, I called them and told them it was ready, they were again really pleased and said they would be by later in the day. 3 days later I call them again and ask when they want it and they say they will be on the weekend. 7 days later they say they will be by at the end of the day. 2 weeks later I call and get no answer so I leave a message and send them an email explaining that starting at the beginning of next month there will be a $20/week storage fee since it's been over 30 days since it was completed. I call them in the middle of the week to again confirm when they wanted it and explain the fee, but no answer so I leave a message and text them. The week after I call and no answer so I leave another message, email, and text. On week 3 there was still no answer but they called me back 2 days later explaining there was a family emergency and they were out of town and they would be by within 2 days to pick it up, 3 days go by and they don't show up or call. On week 4 I call one last time and explain that this will be the last message they will get from me and I will hold on to the computer for 90 days at which point I will assume you don't want it and I will take ownership. So we are over day 100 and I now have a very good gaming computer for the low investment of $100.

EDIT: Because a few people are criticizing me of taking advantage of a grieving family, let me clarify; I don't know what the emergency was (for all I know it was some great aunt from Europe), and I have paper work to say it's the companies (mine) after 90 days. Now I pride myself on customer satisfaction so I called them numerous times to try and verbally let them know it was ready and if after a few months they contact me back asking for the computer I will give it back to them.",1,1622909568
2784,"When the drive for a new iPhone is too great, you get fired.","I work as an Executive Support Technician for a large company, I have a team of 8 people under me and we support high ranking executives and their administrative assistants.

Because of the nature of our work, we have the ability to ""get things done"" that the standard help desk cannot, We can force upgrades that would otherwise be denied, get things expedited, skip the normal procedures and talk directly with the people who fix the issues.

While we are executive support, there are still levels, when the CEO is in town, one of us is camped outside of where ever he might be in case there is any sort of issue.

For lower people, we make sure things get done as quick as possible, but it's not a drop everything situation.

As we prepped for the releases of the new iPhones, we braced for the flood of ""I NEED this"" that inevitably happens. We slot in orders immediately for the top of the pyramid guys, and then work our way down, replacing, or sometimes having to tell them that they have to wait because the device they have is too new to warrant replacing.

So on Monday, the EA of a lower end Exec put in a request to get both herself and the exec new 256 Gig iPhone X's

The Exec was put on the approval list, with a wait, but the EA was denied. She had just been issued an iPhone 7 a few months ago, and she began to raise hell about ""I have to support him, so I need to have the exact same phone etc etc""

Still denied.

On Tuesday, I get a ticket from the EA - iPhone will not turn on, require replacement with attached ticket for iPhone X request.

I send one of my drones out to investigate and I immediately get a text saying I have to get out there, I get out there and the iPhone is wet, not just wet, but dripping wet, like just pulled out of a glass of water wet with a screen that could only be called heavily Cracked.

the EA states ""I was using it and it fell into my water bottle""

So we take the phone back to our area and I've called my manager over and we explain it, It's obvious what has happened, We've toweled it off and when we turn it over, water drizzles out of the cracked screen.

Well as luck would have it, we have spares, so I pluck a nice 64 gig Rose Gold iPhone 6s that was returned when the previous owner departed the company, I call and have the sim reprovisioned, I re-assign the phone in Airwatch and I have the phone returned to the EA.

10 minutes later, said EA is at our door, ranting, screaming saying that she can't work like this, she needs a new phone and if we don't give her one ""EXECUTIVE"" will make us give her one. I step in and tell her ""A permanent replacement is just beginning the process, we have had to issue you this phone as a loaner so you can continue working until a permanent replacement is sourced""

Queue Wednesday, the approval process has come back denied for her replacement, the loaner phone is now her permanent phone. This info is relayed to the EA, who is fuming, lots of ""EXECUTIVE WILL HEAR ABOUT THIS"" and statements of ""I can't believe this is happening to me, how will I work?""

Wednesday afternoon, same EA, new ticket - iPhone broken, need replacement. I head out myself to see the issue and the phone looks like it was dragged behind a semi truck for 100 miles, the screen is shattered, a big chunk missing out the top near the camera, big dents in the back. I calmly ask ""What happened? This phone was perfect this morning?""

The reply: ""Well, since you gave me an old phone, my case didn't fit and it slipped out of my hands and fell down the stairs.""

Well ok, could you tell me when and what stairwell this happened? she does, and I take the mangled phone, I grab my manager and we head off to the security office, and we pull the tapes.

On the video we see the EA walking up the stairwell (concrete stairs, metal hand rail, your typical big building non public stairwell) she reaches the top and proceeds to fling the phone, like one would skip a stone, down from the 6floor to the mid floor landing, where it lands, she steps on it and then kicks it down to the 5th floor, it bangs off the metal fire door and she picks it up, examines it and then tosses it down the stairs to towards the 4th floor, bouncing off a few steps before landing on the mid landing between 5 and 4.

She picks the device up, and pries a large section of something off the phone (We suspect this was the chunk missing by the camera) and then heads back up the stairs, running the phone against the cinder block wall as she climbs.

So we grab a copy of the video, we head straight to HR, we sit with the personnel director, we show her the video, we show her the 2 damaged iPhones, we show her the tickets, I relay the abuse thrown to myself and my techs about how she demands an iPhone X and has taken to destroying company property to get it.

Termination follows, however the user has gone home for the day, her accounts are disabled, her security badge flagged.

7:30 am today, the EA attempts to get into the building and her badge does not work, so she has to walk to the security office, the security officer takes the badge, and walks her to HR.

8 am, the Security officer and two members of HR are escorting the EA out of the building, she's alternating between yelling and crying, Demanding that EXECUTIVE be called and that she's being framed.

As she's brought through the main foyer, I'm on the 2nd floor balcony that overlooks the entrance, she looks up at me, curses me and is gone.

Both phones, her laptop and other equipment have been placed with the Legal team as a precaution. Company policy when there is a messy separation.

Maybe I'll buy my team pizza for lunch today, seems like the right thing to do.

TLDR; Executive Assistant breaks iPhones in her quest to get an iPhone X, gets unemployment instead.",1,1622909500
2785,I saw a murder today,"So I work for a local government, which includes a jail. It also includes a coroners office, so when I started I got to see two human bodies being dissected in a very sterile environment. However, today I got a call that someone was having problems accessing the camera system at the jail. Video was playing, but the picture wasn't moving. After figuring out it was a video driver problem on a new 2021 computer and getting her on an old one, it worked. She needed to view the holding cell for new inmates at a specific time, and started scrubbing for footage to make sure it worked before hanging up the call. She managed to click right to the footage of one man stabbing another repeatedly. Lots of blood. She then scrubbed forward to where he was covered by a blanket and happily said ""Okay it works!

2786,"This one's a simple one, but I can't get it out of my head.","I work in a store that offers technical support for consumer-level technology.

A few days ago I had an elderly gentleman that we'll call Pete (name changed for privacy). Our receptionist made him a walk-in appointment earlier that day and I ended up taking it. When I opened it all up, the only notes I saw were ""Third-party software, hard of hearing.""

I walked up to Pete and greeted him, saw that he was staring at my lips as to read them, then I asked if he knew American Sign Language (ASL). I've been trying to learn ASL it as a sort of side-hobby for a few months now. Pete signs ""yes"" and we continue the conversation in Sign. Turns out the issue is with Skype, which keeps crashing on his roughly 5-year old tablet, and he's been having difficulty video-calling his wife who is Deaf.

She lives in a different continent, she travelled there for a temporary work opportunity and would be there for two years. This being the mid-way point, it's now been 1 year since Pete's seen his wife. Skype is the only way they both know how to communicate efficiently long-distance, as neither are comfortable with email or other text-based services.

As I go through verifying that he knows his password and making sure there's a backup of his device, Pete and I are signing back and forth and his face was completely lit up. I felt so good to be able to, albeit slowly, speak with him in his language and give him the time he deserved, even if his reason for visiting us had little to do with our physical product.

Once everything was verified and backed up, I uninstalled Skype and reinstalled it, had Pete sign in, and use Skype's test call to ensure it wouldn't crash (as it would immediately upon call creation before). Test call went through fine. Sweet.

I looked down to write a few extra notes and began to hear some coughs. I looked up and there was Pete, crying while waving to his wife through Skype. Pete called her and she picked up! He introduced me to her and told me that it'd been 3-weeks since they'd heard from each other. I stepped away to give him a moment alone.

It's moments like these that keep me going as a technician. Even though I barely touched Pete's tablet, ""fixing"" it made me feel like a hero. It's been a few days and I can still see his smile.

Just thought I'd share, thanks for reading.

2787,"""What do you mean we told you to stop the backups??!""","So a bit of background first. I used to be a shift team lead for a hosted outsourcing company that provided our own software on AS400 based systems to various financial institutions. Some of these companies were very small and only had a single box. Some were larger and had a pair of boxes (usually one serving as the live environment and one as the test environment). Others had more for different functions.

Some did all their own development, others paid us to do their dev and bugfixing work for them. One of the most important things we handled in the NOC was physical backups. Each box had it's own backup schedule, where it would back up to IBM Ultrium tapes. Each morning, one of our tasks was to remove the tape from the previous night's backup, scan the barcode and send them offsite to our secure storage facility. Once that was done we'd make sure that the scratch tape for the next scheduled backup was loaded and ready to go.

This one company we dealt with had both a live and test environment, and had their own in-house developers. Initially they were both backed up nightly but due to a cost limiting exercise, the IT manager on their side submitted a change request to limit the test system to one backup per week, to be carried out on a Friday night. No problem. Amend the backup schedules, and update the documentation to reflect the change. All sorted.

I wasn't there when all of this happened but it was all included and documented on the shift handover report when our team took over, so we knew we didn't have to load tapes for this particular box until Friday.

About 8 months later, we received a P1 ticket in the NOC from one of their developers, this happened on a Thursday afternoon (I'm sure you can see where this is going by now).

""Help! Library ABC1234 on the test system was just accidentally deleted. Please can this be restored from last night's backup urgently?""

My tech who received the ticket confirmed with me correctly that they were now on weekly backups on this particular box, and the most recent backup we had was almost a week old. My tech relays this back to the end user in an email. The user calls back immediately

""No! That's not good enough, if that's the most recent backup you have that means we've lost almost a week's worth of critical work. I need to speak to your supervisor immediately!""

I duly took over the call.

""Your colleague has just informed me that you've stopped backing up this system daily! This is unacceptable.""

""As I heard my colleague explain, the backup schedules are decided by your company, and as this was a test system as opposed to a live environment, the decision was taken on your side to reduce the backup frequency from daily to weekly. You need to speak to your IT department for clarity on this.""

""I'll do that, you haven't heard the last of this!""

About half an hour later, another one of my guys gets a call asking to be put straight through to me.

""Yes, this is John Smith, the Systems Manager from Company XYZ. I've just had an interesting conversation with one of my developers stating that you've stopped doing our backups that we're paying you to perform. Just for your information this call is being recorded and I've got a conference call with our solicitors in 15 minutes whereby if this is not resolved satisfactorily by that time, we will be filing a lawsuit for the cost of our lost development work, and a recording of this call will be used as evidence.""

Wow, talk about aggressive. I explain to the guy that 8 months ago, someone at their company submitted a change request that we reduce the backup frequency on this system from daily to weekly, and this was carried out as requested.

""Well that's just insane. Nobody here would have done that. I need the name of the person who submitted the request as well as the person on your side who actioned the request without verifying that the request was received from an authorised member of our CAB!""

""OK, well I wasn't on-shift when that change was made but it will have all been documented on our ticketing system, bear with me a second. Ah, here we go. So the request was made on April 12th this year by a John Smith, Systems Manager. That's you, right?""

""Uhm, that's not right, there must be another person here with that name.""

""You've got two John Smiths, both working as Systems Managers? Does that not get confusing?""

""No, erm. I don't recall asking you to do this.""

""Well we have the email saved to the original ticket, along with several emails back and forth where we asked you to clarify a couple of points, and also a scanned copy of the signed change form where you've written your name and signature. Did you want me to forward these over for your solicitors? Although I suspect you might already have copies of them if you check your sent items folder..""

""Erm, no that's fine thanks. I'll let the developers know that you can't recover the file.""

""That'd be great thanks, is there anything else I can help you with today Mr Smith?""

*click.

Printed off the ticket and dug out a copy of the call recording to forward around to the team, and I added this to my training guides for new hires as an example of why documenting everything is critical.

Why do small businesses fail? No one knows fundamentals shortcomings in Busines while starting of business. But if you want your business to succeed, you need to know and avoid these 4 common reasons why businesses fail.
1. Financing Hurdles
2. A primary reason why small businesses fail is a lack of working capital. In most a business owner aware that how much money is needed to keep while operations, running day-to-day expenses, payrolls, paying fixed and variable overhead expenses, such as rent and utilities &amp; vendors payments. 
3. When business faced fundamentals shortcomings, often owners failed to tuned with revenues, expenses, overhead payments, payrolls &amp; vendor payments. Due to funding shortfalls a small business out of operation.
2 Pricing of the product &amp; services.
A second reason is business owners fails to decide the correct products and services.to beat out the competition in highly saturated industries. Business owners intentionally lower the price of a product or service to entice new customers.

This issue happened all the time and usually it only takes a few minutes to resolve.  I made a little small talk, ran through the KB, kicked the user's connection, everything looked as it should, and go to end call.

me: Ok I think that's got you set, just give it a few minutes and you should be able to log right in!

N: Ok thanks! click.

\-a few minutes later-

N (calling back): Hi I still can't get into my Citrix?!

me: I'm very sorry about that, give me just a second to get my detailed process pulled up so I can get this resolved for you.

N: Dont you just hit a button and it's fixed???? (obviously irritated) 

me: uh no ma'am ~~I'm not a wizard~~ that's unfortunately not how it works.  Give me just a minute and we'll get this sorted.

Cue me frantically asking for help while on mute because I couldn't find the solution in the KB's and had never run into this issue before.  We finally got her up and running but it required a remote session to the computer to end all related processes/connections and a reboot for good measure.  My colleagues got a good laugh because of me and I gained a lot of experience.",1,1622825926

&amp;#x200B;

Her: Hi, I did the thing to get the document on 05.31., but I need it today so that I can go to my daughter's birthday party. I tried downloading the electronic app, but it only says that I have registered. Please help.

Me: The issue is that the app looks up an electronic version of the physical document. As no document has been issued yet, it cannot display data. The processing time for it is 8 days under normal circumstances.

Her: You are clearly wrong because my friends already had it available as soon as they did the thing!

Me: Then that is an anomaly that they should get investigated, as something is most likely wrong with it.

Her: Listen, I just want you to get it done now. It wouldnt do that of all people, her mother is not there!

Me: Again, under the best case scenario, the processing time is 8 days, plus postage. The latter obviously does not matter for the app. However, as currently there are literal millions of these being issued, it can easily extend by as much as a week. 

Her: I did not ask for excuses, tell me who I should call so it gets done!

Me: (was said in a much more professional manner but this is the gist of it) Lady, you are demanding from me, a person who has no access or authorization to any of the relevant systems or departments, to kick the entire government into high gear and cut your processing time in half by somehow letting you jump the queue, just so you can attend your daughter's birthday party...? Even though it is past 15:00, and government business hours end at 13:00 on Fridays, so even if I had all that power, it is physically not possible to do, as no one is working anymore?

Her: Yes. 

Me: No.

Her: Well have a nice weekend! I sure am glad that you are sitting there for nothing!

2800,I thought you knew what you were doing. I take that back.,"Happened back in 2007, during my campus days. It's also the only incident from those days worth telling.

My campus is funded by a Chinese clan association that happens to be extremely wealthy, so we enjoyed lots of benefits that other campuses do not get. One such perk was that students are allowed to work certain jobs within the campus during their free time for a rather high hourly allowance (subject to a cap per week and with the undertaking that it must not affect our studies or grades) and I landed one such job in Tech Support. 

During a slow day, a fellow student came in to the support office for help. His laptop had Vista and 2GB of memory (remember, 2GB of memory in a laptop during those times was *a lot*), but he downgraded it to XP and bumped the memory up to 3GB for even greater performance.  XP ought to fly on such a machine, but according to the guy, XP has slowed down so much that it was taking more than 15 minutes for the desktop to respond to user input from a cold boot. At the same time, he needs to install some accountancy software for an upcoming tutorial.

I set him up on one of the tables and had him turn on the laptop. This fellow wasn't kidding, XP booted to a black screen and white cursor and stayed like that for at least 10 minutes before it finally started drawing the desktop elements one by one, which includes a system tray that has more than two rows of icons and a desktop filled to the brim with all manner of shortcuts, files, installers and whatnots.  It was almost 30 minutes by the time the Start menu would respond to a mouse click and even then, the system would randomly freeze for a while doing basic things like accessing Control Panel or the Add/Remove wizard. msconfig showed hundreds of active startup items that I gave up going through the list as soon as I saw it. And forget about software installation, the first software installer took almost five minutes just to start, and it eventually hung when I was specifying a custom installation path at the student's request.

Clearly, the performance issues need to be solved before we even talk about software installation. However, we also have a rule that no Support staff is allowed to delete anything on the user's laptop (duh), and since this fellow was able to install XP and upgrade his memory, I assumed we were on similar levels. So I told him to enter Safe Mode, identity everything he does not need, uninstall them, then come back to us for the software installation. He asked what Safe Mode was, so I demonstrated it to him by rebooting the laptop (which took another eternity), mashing F8 and selecting the Safe Mode option. He was really impressed by how the Safe Mode desktop showed up instantly and how fast everything was in Safe Mode, collected the laptop and said that he will come back once he had removed all the useless stuff.

He came back two days later and said that everything is ready for software installation. Guided him to a table and was about to insert the ethernet cable (our software installers are hosted in a separate network accessible only within the Support office) when I noticed that he was booted into Safe Mode. I pointed this out to him, and his answer is forever burnt in my mind.

""Yeah, I know. I could not decide what to uninstall, so I decided to just boot into Safe Mode from now on to do my stuff. Don't worry, I selected 'Safe Mode with Networking' for this.""

Not wishing to argue, I went ahead with the installation. In Safe Mode. Install completed, tested the applications which actually worked in Safe Mode, he packed up and left, and I  signed off on the install form. I never saw this guy again in the Support office again for the rest of my student life, but I cannot help wondering if this guy did the entirety of his Accountancy course in Safe Mode, and if he is still booting his new Windows 10 laptops and computers into Safe Mode even to this day.",1,1622794767
2801,You own a... What???,"Please forgive formatting and typos, posting from mobile, etc. 

Kinda front desk... We had a few desks that shared first-contact with customers. Mine was the repair desk, technically, but I could do standard sales, customers refunds, stock checks and back orders too. My desk was also the hub for floor walkers and security's radio charging docks. Elsewhere we had the checkouts and business customer lounge (giant perspex box with sofa, coffee machine and terminal for payments and basic forms).

This particular post involves ink cartridge refills and replacement for printers. For those unfamiliar with these things, there are literally thousands if not hundreds of thousands of different ink cartridges and designs. A long time ago, there only used to be perhaps 20 different ink cartridges for a small amount of photo-quality machines for the domestic market and fewer for the expensive office types. It used to be a very controlled purchase because this stuff was very expensive to begin with. Now, you can get a cartridge for perhaps 10c per unit or less. 

We used to refill cartridges with syringes and needles with selected shades of ""cyan, magenta, yellow and black"" and different brands had different shades of each. Whenever we offered our services, we asked customers to sign a waiver which told the customer, ""your experience of colour and quality of your printing may differ from the original brand's expectations,"" in other words, your kid's skin tone in a printed photo might look different from reality and you'd need to adjust print settings accordingly. 

We store these waivers in conjunction with a customer number and copies of receipts for various uses including the unlikely event of an audit from the ink companies we had licenses with and to identify repeat customers who might benefit from a promotion or two.

Anyway, an early Karen walked right up to my desk and slapped down a mess of paper and ink cartridge stuffed in a file transparency pocket and a receipt, demanding a refund. Ok, fair enough. I asked what happened and they said, ""the machine leaked everywhere and messed up sixteen copies..!""
""Wait... 16?"" I thought this number was odd, surely you'd stop printing after the first or third mess?
""I'm trying to print party invitations for my kid and I can't because you f-d up the refill!""
I stared at her for a moment, but was willing to overlook the rudeness on account of the woman's anger...
""What the f- are you gonna do about it?""
Second strike. 
""Well, let's see. What printer are you using?""
""What's that got to do with it?""
""I need to know which brand of ink I need to check.""
""Oh, it's a BMW."" 
... What!? To my knowledge, they don't nor ever have made domestic printers. Maybe something in their own offices, but... I highly doubt it???
""A BMW? They do printers now, do they?"" I lazily slip on a glove (latex-free rubber-like glove) and pick up the mess, taking out the cartridge. On inspection, I can just about make out the Canon logo and I'm about to access the records with my clean hand, but pause on the next sentence coming out of her mouth.
""Duh... Ok, I want to speak to a manager."" Third strike.
""I'm the manager on shift right now. How can I help?"" 
""... No, I want to speak to your supervisor.""
""Oh, the owner? They're away on business elsewhere, but I can take a message or give you their email address, if you'd like?""
""Ugh!!! Can't I just take my money back!? Now??""
""I'm sorry but all refunds need to be assessed and still take five working days to process..."" I gingerly place the ink cartridge back down on the messy photo paper.
""You know what? I bought the printer from you, too. I'll come back with it and you can refund me for that, too!"" She snatched up the mess, stuffed it in her handbag. 

Three days later, I'd almost forgotten the incident when Karen came back with a big grey Brother printer and slammed it on the desk, breaking a chip off the paper tray in the process. I glanced up at a nearby security camera watching my till and looked back at the customer. ""There..!"" She also whipped out the transparency pocket and receipt and slapped that on my desk too. I picked up the Canon cartridge and held it next to the Brother printer. 

Thing is... There is NO way that cartridge would fit into the Brother cartridge holder. They were two completely different shapes, and Canon usually held individual colours in individual slots, while Brother had a cartridge for three colours and one for black. There is no way I knew that the two could ever meet. 

I opened the Brother printer cover and... peered into it with incredulous horror. It looked like a blood bag had exploded in there, the rubbery ribbon that pulled the printhead back and forth was nearly torn in two and the carrier was practically demolished. I looked closer and saw what looked like deliberate marks from a knife or screwdriver or something. It was all chewed up but from an external direction. The machine did the rest of it to itself from the mechanical action. ""Ma'am, did you do this yourself..?""
""Well, I had to, it wouldn't fit!! My boyfriend had to use a hammer!""
""Your husband..? You didn't do it?""
""That's not the point! I made it fit, but it didn't work! My boy's party is in two weeks and...""
""I'm sorry madam, but I cannot help you and I have to ask you to leave."" I just didn't have the energy to deal with this stupid woman and we're always reminded that we don't have to serve anyone if we don't want to, time-wasters or abusive customers are a big no-no.

Oh boy did she rage... threw the printer at me over the desk and prompted a police call while Security went into Bouncer mode... they calmed her down outside and, when the owner got back the following weekend, reviewed the security footage. A magistrate later ruled in our favour for damages and 'distress' to our staff as a whole. Turns out, in the hearing, the Karen was actually on meds for psychological stuff, paranoid schizophrenia I think it was, and had a history of kicking off in other shops all over town but wasn't getting social services (county budgets, etc, but magistrate enforced her rights to it and other help later). 

Bittersweet story, really, mental health is a big struggle but yeah... don't serve if you don't feel like it.

Still... a BMW printer... I still smile trying to imagine one.",1,1622790292

Apprentice: Sure I'll do.

A: Done, they are all shorted.

M: Alright (is not rare that they do short, mosfets on the DC power part do actually short badly).

A: In all of them the main fuse is shorted!

M: Hehehe (thinking it was a joke).

A:  They say 250v and 16 amps, so it should be around 15 ohms but instead it's a full short (he applied ohm's law to a fuse).

M: 0\_0 ... it's okay kid... leave them over there and we'll talk later...

There was a power outage the night before I was leaving, but it was back on before morning. I needed to check out to get to the airport so I went to the front desk.

&gt;Me: I would like to check out please.

&gt;Clerk: We can't do that right now, the power is out.

&gt;Me: The lights are on...?

&gt;Clerk: The computers aren't working. We called the manager but she hasn't answered. We can't do anything without the computers. This happens a lot here.

&gt;Me: I need to get to the airport - want me to take a look?

&gt;Clerk: ...sure?

I go back behind the front desk to take a look at the PCs - dead, no lights, no power. Desk lamps, printers, other equipment, same. I looked under one desk, though, and saw a small ethernet switch that was happily blinking away for one port. I followed its power to a dark corner and found two sets of power outlets: the switch was plugged into one white outlet, the only thing there, while the PCs, printers, etc., were all plugged into power strips connected to the orange ones. I turned off the power strips.

&gt;Me: Where is your battery backup?

&gt;Clerk: What's that?

&gt;Me: Do you have an equipment room? Maybe with other computers or the phone system in it?

&gt;Clerk: Oh, you mean the electrical closet?

&gt;Me: ...sure!

We go to the electrical closet where I see a large UPS sitting on a pallet. I found the breaker, noted it was tripped, and reset it. We then returned to the front desk area where the computers were. I turned the power strips on, one at a time, bringing the computers and everything back up. Just as we finished the manager showed up.

&gt;Clerk, to the manager: It's OK now, he fixed it. (pointing at me)

&gt;Manager: Fixed what?

&gt;Clerk: The computers, the power was out. He did something in the electrical closet and turned the power back on.

&gt;Manager, to me: What did you do?

&gt;Me: The breaker was tripped on your battery backup, I just reset it. I think there are too many things connected to it - everything that is plugged into the orange outlets. When they all come on at once, after a power outage ends, it is too much for it to handle. We turned them on one at a time to keep that from happening. You will want to rearrange how everything is plugged in to keep this from happening again. You probably don't need the printers plugged into the battery backup at all - moving them to regular white outlets may solve the whole problem.

&gt;Manager: Who called you? Service calls need to come from a manager! We need to get a work order.

&gt;Me: Nobody called me, I'm a guest. Can I check out now that the computers are back up?",1,1622743316

shop owner (who I've known all my life) was having a little trouble printing a couple email attachements and asked me for some help. thinking it would be a simple case of walking him through printing attachments from outlook I agreed to help him. (big mistake)

in the end it turned out to be 2 or 3 issues that where just annoying to trouble shoot.

issue 1) tablet isn't actually connected to wifi so can't download the attachments (he though they where as his tablet had the wifi symbol on (with an exclamation mark).
solution: try resetting wifi connection

issue 2) tablet now can't find ANY wifi networks
solution: turn everything off and bring back on one at a time (thankfully turned out turning bluetooth off was enough to fix it)

issue 3) printer was on another network
solution: simply change the network the printer is connected to. this took half an hour, 20 minuts of it being finding the instructions on HOW to connect this printer to wifi, the other 10 being restarting the printer every time I tried a password because the wifi connection procedure had to be done from turning it on and he handed me a list of passwords (yes I mentioned how bad it is to just have a list of passwords written down, even if you keep it in the till) but couldn't remember which was for that wifi network.

&gt; ""YDAQ, this is bad. Really bad! You know that label printer we keep in the back?"" 

&gt; ""You mean the one that we print literally thousands of labels on every week? The one that occasionally clogs the rewinder and spews labels all over the room unless someone's babysitting it during the entire print?""

&gt; ""That's the one! We've got a big problem now! You know how every single client uses white labels, right?""

&gt; ""Yeah, and...?""

&gt; ""Well, we just received the rolls of 100,000 *black* labels one client requested...""

&gt; ""Okay...""

&gt; ""... and they're too dark for the sensor to tell whether there's a label or a gap! It thinks nothing's loaded every time!""

&gt; ""Can't we set it to continuous mode and skip the sensor altogether?""

&gt; ""This thing's older than my grandmother! It doesn't have that setting.""

&gt; ""Can we skip the calibration step?""

&gt; ""Tried that too, but the whole thing goes off the rails after about 20 labels.""

So I started to walk into the printer room. I won't lie to you boys, I was terrified. But I pressed on, and as I made my way past my coworkers a strange calm came over me. I looked at the display on the printer while it was printing a roll of white labels. ""Printing 1 of 1,"" it said, happily spitting out label 500 or so.  And then it hit me, once the printer detected labels the software took over and sent everything to the printer as a single unit, after which it did whatever it was told.

I don't know if it was divine intervention or the kinship of all cranky things, but I tell you, at that moment I was a printer technician. I grabbed a pair a scissors and a roll of tape and snipped a few white labels off a roll. Three, to be exact, the number needed for the calibration step. I taped those labels to the end of a roll of black labels and loaded it into the printer. The air was heavy with anticipation as one by one, the white labels spooled through the printer. And just before the black labels hit the sensor, the display read, ""Ready.""

By rights it shouldn't have worked. But just this one time, it did.

https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/nk7aqs/we_cant_access_anything_on_the_network/

I originally started to post this the next day but didn't for some reason...so that's whey it reads a little weird.

What an interesting day yesterday was....

(a little backstory) The local mangler was the former owner of this business that our company bought. They still do things their own way and bitch loudly when we try to get them to comply with how we do things. They came with there own IT ""Genius"" that could do ANYTHING and they don't NEED our IT services...except when they do. I don't agree with the way they do things but they are 1500 ish miles away and we don't get down there terribly often (espcecially since the end of the world happened)

On to the conclusion...well...maybe the middle. Not sure yet.

As I was looking up flights I was able to get on a conference call with our CEO, CIO, and the local guy. The local guy immediately started in on how our IT department sucks and his guy is SO much better and if we would just let him have access and and and and and.

Picture the old cartoons where the characters face keeps getting redder and redder until they finally let off the steam whistle...that was me.

I BLEW the f$%k up. I started yelling at him and came really close to getting myself fired. I was NOT nice. After I got everything off my chest I felt better. Then it was time to get down to solving this.

After I looked up flights from the midwest to the south east and started adding in car, hotel etc I figured out what my base budget was. We made a list of what needed to happen, what equipment was critical and what could wait until someone was able to get down there.  I called down there to a local MSP and actually was able to negotiate them to move the equipment over to the new building (it's a block down the road) and temporarily run patch cables to get everything up until someone can get down there and permanently get things installed.

Internet access will be at least a week and a half so I had the MSP go to the roof of both building and see if they could see each other. I was in luck and they used two Ubiquiti NanoBeams to get them up and running until the new circuit can be installed.

They are up and running for now, it looks like crap but it works, and I still have a job. (Still working fine a week later.)",1,1622642494
2819,I need a VM!,"So this is ""technical support for University students"" who didn't get their way with University IT. Backstory time. I work in IT Security and run my own home lab, complete with Dell R730s (Virtualized - ESXI), Firewall Appliances, and proper switches, routers, etc. Anyone who's been to my house is aware of this. They've all seen the rack at some point or another.

$Friend = Master's student researching memory analysis. (Er: Also more of an acquaintance that I tolerate.)

$Me = .... Some random dude, probably not important.

$Friend: ""Hey, you've got a home lab right?""

Me: ""Yes. Mostly running expensive VMs that I use for dev testing and corporate stuff. Why do you ask?""

Friend: ""I need a large VM. University won't give me what I want.""

Me: ""What are you asking for? They've got lots of spare resources specifically for grad students doing research papers.""

Friend: ""16 cores, 48GB of memory, 2TB of SSD storage and standardized networking.""

Me: ""OK, that's... excessive. What could you possibly be doing to justify that kind of resource usage?""

Friend: ""Memory analysis research. I have 150 memory dumps at 4.5GB each.""

Me: ""Using Volatility? Your ask is very excessive for that use case. What did they give you, 4-6 cores, 8-16GB of memory, and a TB of storage?""

Friend: ""8 cores, 16GB of memory, and 1TB of storage.""

Me: ""I'm somewhat confused. That's more then enough for you. What exactly is wrong?""

Friend: ""I don't have root on the VM, and I don't have enough resources.""

Me: ""Well - you do have enough resources. But I would ask them for root if you need it.""

Fast forward a couple days and they won't give him root to install and use specific programs. Instead they gave him permissions to run those programs as sudo. He's upset and still harassing me about it. (I can't do anything about it though).

Me: ""Here's a VM in my network. Here's a VPN login to my network. There is an ESXI server &lt;here&gt; that you can access with this set of username and password. I've built you a VM on that server that you can access. It's username and password is &lt;another set of credentials&gt;, and root is &lt;root credentials&gt;. You don't have permissions to anything else.""

Friend: ""Resources?""

Me: ""That's about the max I can assign you, and is line with what the University gave you anyways. I agree with their assessment for your needs, even that's probably a little overspecced.""

\---------------

Next day:

Friend: ""Hey, I broke the VM I think. It's always complaining about permission issues.""

Me: ""Did you change the permissions on the file structures?""

Friend: ""Yeah, I kept getting permission issues. So I did recursive chmod 777 on ""/"" as root.""

Me: \*Internally - Are you fucking kidding me right now.\*

Me: ""Yeah - I'm not fixing that. Have you got a backup of your data? I'll reset the VM and you can reinstall the OS.""

Friend: ""No backup of the data. Deleted it off my local machine, taking up too much space.

Me: ""\*very frustrated. Builds new VM. Loads disk, retrieves data. Wipes old VM.""

Me: ""Don't touch file permissions if you can't figure out what you're doing. Run your python scripts, build your dataset for this. Monkeying around with the VM is just wasting a lot of your time and my time.""

A couple months later (laziness), I get a message. ""Hey! I'm done my thesis finally. Took a while to get the analysis done on the hardware. Thank you!"" Meanwhile, I get stat reports from ESXI on resource usage. The VM spent over 90% of it's time alive reasonably inactive. (I'm not sure why he didn't just tell his python script to work through the list of files in a structure, but whatever.)",1,1622635840

2822,Dear User...,"Dear User,

I hope this email reaches you well. I wanted to tell you several things that you probably don't realize about my job.

First of all, most of the days, it's really chill I just login into all of my systems, authorize myself, make a coffee and then enjoy some good old memes. I have at least a good 40-50 minutes on a calm day before I get the first call.

But then, there are those times where I'm stressed the fuck out because we have a major incident impacting all of the employees. Sometimes even us, so we're even that more frustrated because we can't really help you and we gotta explain you why. To which you sometimes react very angrily. Like yesterday. And on last Friday. And on last Thursday. Yes! Imagine, three global issues in a row. I had to deal with at least 30 calls per day While you sat blissfully unaware and ignorant happily looking at your SAP not working waiting in the queue until your call got through. Or you watched your VPN randomly disconnecting while picking up the phone to call us.

You don't even realize all the things that I have to do in your name in order to resolve the issue. It doesn't even have to be a global issue.

I have to listen to the same tiring words everyday. No, your story doesn't interest me at all. I don't care about when the issue happened, I don't care about the fact that you can't work because frankly – you are a stupid user who was told just to ""click here"" and ""click there and that's how you create your group meeting in Teams, if it doesn't work, call the SD, they will help you"". You're like a trained monkey.

And by the time you even say the first sentence, I already know that I'm dealing with another automatic login issue which is dealt with in literally 30 seconds. Or another two minute reinstallation of MS Teams. Or another frozen Citrix session. Sometimes, I willingly interrupt you with some random made up question seemingly related to the issue just to stop you talking and letting me help you so we can both survive another day.

I have to listen to you scream and yell for issues that I have absolutely no control over. No, I have no freaking idea why your Excel freezes a lot. I have no idea why your Outlook suddenly doesn't receive newest emails. I have no idea why your account got blocked. That's how things are. Yet you still yell at me like it's my fault. Eat a piece of shit, dear user.

Also, you don't realize that I'm just there to log the ticket, try out some basic troubleshooting according to our KBs and if nothing helps, then send you further. That's literally my job description.

Oh, I see! You want me to do things extra for you? That's now how it works, they don't pay me enough for this shit. Or in the worse case, you do realize this and choose to yell at me because you love having power over people. But beware! Even abusive people like you can be escalated to your manager. I just have to keep my cool and act according to the procedure we adhere to. So who's really in power? Yes baby, it's me and I'm proud of it.

Sometimes, you might call me because one of our agents told you that your issue will be scalated to the second level. And you tell the obvious lie that the second level didn't call you. And you know why? Because you are on of those types of people who don't pick up calls from unknown numbers under any circumstances. When I actually check the ticket – which you can also easily check yourself – the second level attempted to call you, you just couldn't be bothered to pick up the damn phone. And no, I have no possibility to transfer you there, I can't give out their number. But I am happy to give you the email to their manager who will tell you the same things I just did during the call.

Yes, I put you on hold a lot. That's because I just want to let out a big sigh, say a few cuss words to myself and then continue in resolving your issue. I mute my microphone a lot because I am hungry and was about to eat the breakfast but then you called me.

You don't realize that there's all these SLAs which would probably make your head spin. That's why my call has to be short. That's why I always ""forget"" to ask if there's anything more I can help you with.

Joke about the Service Desk with your colleagues all you want over that chat in MS Teams you forgot to hide it when I connected remotely to your computer. Tell them that we're the stupid ones. Or the incompetent ones. But mark my words – without us, you are nothing. You couldn't even turn on your computer. Or you couldn't have your domain account unblocked.

Dear User, for the love of fuck – just please. Use the fucking google before you call us. You would actually know that most of the issues aren't really complex and don't require you to pickup the phone and call us.

Know one simple thing – this job, this one job I have is just a means to pay for my survival in a world I utterly despise. To pay for the food, for the roof and basic necessities of life. So please, don't make my job harder than it already is.

Best regards,
your IT Service Desk",1,1622567292
2823,Oops! Laptop struggles are real...,"Let me take you back to the late 90’s. Our company had over 150 consultants out in the field all over the US installing PeopleSoft. Consultants would at times be away for a week or two at a time. Most of the time they would fly home for the weekend but if it was ‘go live’ time they’d stay the weekend for the Monday morning launch. 

All that to say that one of our best consultants (C) was away on a big account and finally was able to go home after 2.5 weeks. When the consultant supervisor (CS) tried to contact him via email there was no response for a couple days...

Me: IT, this is bambam67...

CS: Hey, could you give ‘consultant’ a call he said he’s having trouble with his laptop. 

Me: Of course, I’ll call him right now. 

I hang up and call consultant at home, they usually had 3-4 days between deployments. 

C: Hello?

Me: Hey C, this is bambam67 from the help desk. I heard from CS that you’re having some issues. I’m hoping I can help. 

C: I’m not sure if you can. 

Me: Why not? What’s going on? 

C: It’s kind of embarrassing...

Me: Don’t worry, I’ve heard it all. (I had)

C: Well, I flew home on Friday night. I hadn’t been home in weeks. My wife and kids all came to pick me up at the airport. 

Me: Okay. (Wondering where this is going)

C: They met me in the airport with signs welcoming home. It was adorable. 

Me: I bet, sounds great. 

C: We get to the car and we load everything up and I back out of the parking spot. I hit a bump and hit the gas to go over it. 

Me: (realizing what happened) It wasn’t a bump was it? 

C: No. I set my suitcase and computer bag down so I could load the kids in the car. I put my bags in the back but I missed my computer bag and ran over it. 

Me: Oh my, okay, how bad is it? 

C: First off, this was completely my fault. I will pay for the replacement. 

Me: Let’s worry about that later. Do you have it there with you? 

C: Yes... (sounding a bit dejected)

Me: Can you describe the damage? 

C: it’s really bad. You know how laptops are usually flat? This is a ‘U’. I can’t even open the lid. I’m afraid I’ve lost all my notes and files. CS will fire me for sure. 

SIDE-NOTE: IT had just sent out a message a week before asking people to take better care of their equipment and treat it like their own. It was a bit stern and straight to the point and some people thought it could be a termination offense (even though that was never stated). 

Me: Look, no one is getting fired. What I need you to do is pack that thing up the best you can and overnight it to me. 

C: Yes, of course. I go right now. 

Me: Great as soon as I get it and take a look I’ll give you a call. 

The next day we received the package. The IBM 760 laptop was munched! What I found out later that his car was a SUV. It rolled on and over that bag. He wouldn’t send the bag back, he’s was going to buy his own replacement. 

I grabbed our department toolbox that we kept in the server room and was able to use a screwdriver to pry open the top. Because it was now ‘U’ shaped, the hinges finally gave way and snapped. Pieces of laptop flew across the room as my coworkers watched me operate. They cringed at the site and sound of cracking, mangled plastic. 

As I’ve stated before, the great thing about that laptop was how all parts were modular and replaced very easily. As I carefully discarded the screen that was shattered beyond imagination, taking the brunt of the tire, I went to work on the keyboard. Like a messed up scrabble board, letters are scattered and missing. I tore the keyboard off to discover the condition of the real treasure inside, the hard drive. 

As I pull away the last bits of keyboard, there it was, the hard drive nested inside this mangle piece of plastic. I was careful to take the battery out first, it looked slightly damaged. I did my best to gently remove the hard drive. As I took it out I could hear the cracking of plastic not wanting to give up its treasure. Inspecting the hard drive, there wasn’t a scratch on it! 

Me: Someone get me a new shell! 

Someone scrambled behind me and grabbed a brand new IBM 760 shell and placed on our shared center table in our IT room. I placed the hard drive in and it snapped in like normal. Put in a new battery and was ready to test. I slid the power button to ON and the IBM screen pops up. Good so far. The screen went dark, this was the moment of truth, you could only hear the mechanical sounds of the drive spinning, as we watched holding our breath. When the Windows logo appeared you would have thought we just won the super bowl!!  Cheers and high fives for everyone! It booted to the logon screen and acted as if nothing had happened to it. I called C: 

C: This is C. 

Me: I’ve got some good news and bad news. 

C: What’s the bad news? 

Me: Your laptop is a complete loss...except...

C: Except what? 

Me: Except the good news is we were able to recover the hard drive, we are packing it up right now, you should receive it tomorrow morning. 

C: Oh my god, thank you so much. I’ll have to call CS and let him know. 

Me: No worries, I just talked to him and let him know we swapped out your laptop for another one. 

C: Did you tell him what happened? 

Me: Yep, told him you were having trouble with the shell (not a total lie) and it needed replacement. He was happy to get you back online and setup your next gig. 

C was a great person and always took care of his computer equipment so I wanted to do him a solid. As for the broken IBM shell...I used that in our training session for new hires on computer equipment responsibility. Needless to say it was very affective! Everyone was happy, back to work and I had a visual aid as a warning to new hires. 

All right everyone! I have to get back to work myself. Until next time remember, when someone calls you for help, YOU are their solution, helping others is it’s own reward. 

Cheers!",1,1622566845
2824,The printer that wont print on the sides,"I am not a tech support guy, I am just *that kid* that parents and all their friends rely on to show them the basics and solve whatever issue they get. Do I know how to solve those issues? Usually no, but through trial and error all things can be solved.

Its sometime early 2020 and I get a call. Moms friend, nice guy, drops me some coins for my troubles so I don't have complaints. Apparently his printer will not print on sides of the page, cuts off two centimeters on both sides while he needs an entire page.  Months ago he had that issue before and it was simply wrong printing settings.  So I expected it to be 1.go there 2.set page margins to 0. 3.done, in and out 20 minute adventure. 
After I arrived there he demonstrated the issue, he printed a PDF file using adobes reader and of course two centimeters on both sides are blank, the text is cut off. 
So I do my thing and set page margins to zero. Aaaaaand... The issue is solv..
No it still wont print on the sides. 
Great... What else can I try? Maybe its adobe readers fault. I'll just use firefox to print this out and it will be good.
Nope, still no good.
Ok I got nothing, lets google for it. He made a comment on me googling for solutions
&gt;Why are you looking for help? Your own brain is incapable of solving this?

*derp* Well thats a bruh moment, eh, he doesnt mean it. Its fine.
So internet pages say 1. check the program (tried that). 2. check the drivers. So lets get some drivers (OS is windows vista (in 2020)..*sigh*)
By now I am also helping with his phone, but thats a boring story (migrating data from android 2.0 that somehow survived a decade to modern xiaomi device), just being more distracted from figuring out the printer.
I find the proper driver, install it and print the test page.
The test page comes without the sides as well. 
Ok thats it, it must be mechanical failure. Time to open up the printer and look inside. Its cartridge must be jammed or something. I suggest to the man that we should open it up, check for faults and clean it. Maybe its cartridge is stuck on something. 
He was skeptical.
&gt;I changed the cartridge myself a month ago. It is all fine and clean inside. And the cartridge is still full.

I am also doubting myself, after all this is a laser printer. I had inkjets jam up and fail to reach sides of the page, but laser printers don't move that way, there is no reason for it not to reach sides of the page.
Still, I am out of options, I tried everything I can think of on the software side by then. I press on.
&lt;Hey lets just open it up, maybe if we pull out the cartridge and put it back in it will clear whatever jam it picked up.

He submits and opens up his printer, pulls out packaging foam, pulls out the cartridge, blows some air into it to clean the dust off. Inserts the cartridge back into the printer, puts the white packaging foam back inside, closes the printer. Runs a print and edges still fail to print. 
...
HOL UP! Why is there packaging foam inside the printer, why did you put packaging foam inside the printer??? Pull that stuff out!
**Printer starts working normally**
AWWWHHHHH YESSHHHHH FINALLYYY
&gt;So we could have just done this and none of this software stuff?

&lt;Well turns out the issue was not in software this time. Why did you put packaging foam inside printer?

&gt;It came with those already inside. How do you know if its not part of the printer?

&lt;hm.. yes how do I know? its all so complex inside with so many pieces that do god knows what. Well never-mind that, now you'll know these cubes of packaging foam are not part of the printer.

Soon after I figured out how to copy phone numbers from android 2.0 to Xiaomi's android 9 system (while juggling other issues like no wifi and lost cables), arrange music just how he liked it and it was time to leave.
As I walked home my mind wandered...
How do we know what is and what is not part of the printer? Is it the contrast between white foam and black plastic? Is it the texture? Perhaps the softness of the material?
How exactly I managed to clear a printer jam by setting print margins to zero months ago?  Or maybe the foam came with the cartridge and was placed inside with the new cartridge? Did the printer print for a month without an issue while jammed or were the cubes inserted later and he failed to make the connection?
And how is that android 2.0 phone still alive?",1,1622488127

2827,Long ago in the caveman era - midrange IBM server - why are you rebooting a server at HIGH NOON?,"*(Short explanation of the environment: Early 1990's when I was working at IBM's tech support for their AS/400 series, a ""midrange"" server system, multiuser, and can have anywhere from 2 to well over 200 hard drives and terabytes of data (large for the 90's).   A few terms may be needed to help the story.  ""IPL"" (initial program load) is basically either powering up or a reboot.  ""RETAIN"", IBM's master worldwide system of problem/incident recording, notes, etc, with records entered by each tech as they work with the clients (all are companies, not individuals). IBM runs 3 shifts in tech support daily....I worked late 2nd/early 3rd shift.)*

A notification came in on RETAIN,  ""msgCPF9999 on damaged object XXXXX in library YYYYY from customer"".  This was about 8:30PM on a Wednesday.    

I'm in the middle of 2nd shift and it seemed to be a fairly normal call.  Usually if it's a program, recompile it or restore it from a backup.  If it's parts of the operating system, fixing stuff like this requires either ""tweaking"" the actual objects by a developer signed on remotely, or re-installing part of the operating system, (partially or fully).

When the call came in, I noticed that the problem record had originated in RETAIN a little bit after NOON today.  There were about 10 recurrences of this customer coming in all afternoon on the same problem record.  All were in regards to damaged or missing objects.  Why so many?

Each technician before me just handled each individual issue, either restoring, recompiling, or tweaking objects.

But I noticed something at the very top entry, the first call in the record: ""Damaged object found at IPL"".

Wait.  This record originated around NOON and it was an error occurring during an IPL?  (A reboot or powering up the system?)

What is a business or any organization doing a reboot at HIGH noon on a typical business day?

Usually a company will have their systems down for maintenance and/or backups like at night or on the weekend, or both.

So this seemed quite odd to me, even more odd and coincidental they had MANY calls this afternoon.

I brought over my manager and had him on the phone call with the client and I sheepishly asked the client, ""What was going on at the time you were IPL'ing the system?""

&lt;long awkward pause&gt;

""We had a DISK CRASH.""

In today's parlance, it was a facepalm event.

If the first technician (or any of them after that) would have asked that basic question, what led to this, the proper answer would be a full restore of the system from backup.  The restore process could take anywhere from 3 to 12 hours (or more), but at the rate this client was going, he'd probably tie us up for the whole next week getting assistance, trying to piece together missing/damaged objects.  

We got them going on doing a partial restore of the system and ran a checking function for missing/damaged objects.

At least I got a few ""attaboys"" for having the presence of mind to look at the forest, not the individual treea.

**TL:DR: Customer calls in with several bad files, not disclosing it was disk crash that caused it, causing over a dozen phone calls from client.  Situation resolved after root cause was found, resolution was to do a simple restore from backups.**",1,1622393103
2828,The changed windows appearance,"This is a fairly short story . But I found the incident amusing. I am currently in training in IT and therefore often get assigned quite different tasks. So I got this ticket forwarded, where someone from the first level support has bitten his teeth. 

Maybe the trainee finds the error. 
According to the user description, the issue was there after a Windows update, apparently, the view of the GUI elements of Windows has changed. When I had now connected via support software , indeed , the view was something very strange . Font was green, the taskbar was divided into black boxes with white borders. Especially the green font of the search bar label caught my eye. I had seen this somewhere before.  
Perhaps you can already think where this leads... .

Anyway, the user had managed to activate the ""high contrast display"" option of Windows without knowing it.
You can activate it from the lockscreen by clicking on the corresponding ""Ease of Access"" icon.
Thus, after disabling and restarting the PC, the view was back to normal and the user was happy.

2829,Standing Up to a Difficult Client,"So, I'm not going to write a whole mini play here, but just give you the gist: I work help desk in health care, and a caller who works with our company calls in for temporary credentials for a contractor. We, of course, have pretty strict rules about this kind of thing because it gives someone access to our system. I have to send the creds to him, and they have to be encrypted. He asks me to send them directly to the 3rd party, and I inform him that I normally can't do that, and will look for a solution. 

He proceeds to call back three times, berate me, threaten to get his ""liaison"" involved, report me, wants to speak to my supervisor, wants my full name, on and on etc. 

I'm very proud of myself for standing my ground and not caving because, of course, this is what social engineers want you to do (not saying he was a bad actor, he probably was just a very entitled person, but it is what it is). I talked it over with my supervisor and came to a solution that got him the info he wanted, while not compromising our security protocols. It only took about ten minutes altogether, and it would have taken even less time if he'd stopped calling me back (something I informed him of during our last conversation. His response (screaming) ""So, this is my fault now?!"" How charming.)

My boss has a 30 step process for finding that same document, that involves opening a word document where a direct link is saved, and using that link as a template to follow.

She does not 'click the link'. 

She types in the [companywebdomain.com] into her browser and clicks through/all/the/sub/ links to open the right page by drilling down from the home page.

Whereas I can print 50 pages before she can open the document.

The other day she handed me a different document and asked me to photocopy it. I asked 'Is this also on the company website?'

'Yes' she replied,, 'but it's too hard to find so I just keep this copy.'

There was a document number [3817] on the bottom of the page. I told the type 3817 in the search bar. It came right up. She was like 'How did you DOOOO  that??!!??'

Me: bumbling amateur not actively working in the it field
Friend: buddy who built his first rig with advice and guidance from yours truly 
Cat: villain

As it is a holiday weekend (4 day 40 hour weeks) I was off today, and I got a phone call from my friend.

Friend: hey, could you come over today, I am having trouble with my new rig.  It keeps randomly restarting.

Me: sure I will be right over.

I arrived, and did the quick basic troubleshooting looking for issues like poorly seated cooler, or blocked ventilation causing overheating.  Nothing.

Me: well, I don’t see anything obvious, and I have nothing going on today, is it ok if I hang out and see if we can replicate the issue.

Friend: sure, it usually happens while I play Path of Exile

He loads PoE and plays for a few hours while we shoot the bull about life, the universe, and everything.  He was even kind enough to offer me a towel as I didn’t have one.  (Sudden heavy rain when it had been just drizzle all day)

As the day progresses, he is having no issues what so ever.  I prepare to pack it up and call it gremlins when in walks his gf’s cat, Villain.  Villain is an all black cat with white eyebrows that give him a permanent evil look.

I pet and play with Villain for a while to kill a little more time.

As I go to leave, Villain wanders off attracted by something.

Me: does Villain usually hang around your rig like that?

2835,Is your num lock on?,"Recently I was on a call with my program manager (PM) and her support person (SP). PM is nearing 70 and not technical at all. SP is a know it all. I’m a software engineer. 

When we get on the call, PM mentions she’s having a lot of trouble with her laptop this morning and sounds close to tears. I ask a few basic questions like what’s it doing? She explains that when she types letters she gets numbers. Apparently SP told her to restart the machine multiple times but it didn’t help. He’s been trying to help her for about 30 minutes now. He then says that she needs her keyboard replaced. This upsets her more because getting that replaced where we work could take weeks. 

Me: what happens when you type O? 
PM: I get a 6. 
Me: your num lock is on. 

I then explained how to shut off num lock. It takes all of 1 minute to diagnose the problem, explain how to fix it, and test it. PM is thrilled and SP shuts up for the first time in his life. It was a nice meeting.",1,1622253492

2838,Universal computer troubleshooting step 3,"In the early 2000's, I worked for a small telecom company. I managed servers and such but also served as a point of escalation for the desktop support techs. My office was a small conference room, so techs would routinely bring the malfunctioning computer into my office for some help. 

One tech brought over a user's laptop because the chap had called in a problem with the display. She was trying to update the device driver but couldn't get to the Internet. I walked her through a few things, then asked her to open a command prompt and ping &lt;the router IP&gt;. 

She glared at me, huffed, and, with a rather condescending tone, told me ""I need you to focus here. He doesn't need to use this ping thing. I need to get on the Internet to download a driver. Can you help me or not?!"". 

Which ... yeah. Unfortunately ""not"" wasn't an option. I told her to reboot (this was *waaaay* before computers managed hot docking/undocking well), and she was astonished that it all magically started working again. How exactly someone managed to work in desktop support for years without developing their own list like ""1 - retry; 2 - restart app; 3- reboot"" to run through on every computer problem ever ... I have no idea.",1,1622233638
2839,Return of the Ninja?,"At the same firm [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/ngxa6s/well_theres_your_problem/) happened, about a year later, and into the early stages of a merger something else happened. The merger was a mutually beneficial merger, not a take-over. We were two law-firms, us mostly in Europe, them mostly in the US, but both of us had offices here and there, sometimes in the same country, so we merged to become a bigger firm, and merge a few offices. It was amicable, but there was still a sense of us and them as we were still largely operating as separate firms.

A bunch of money had recently been spent on the legal staffs offices and IT equipment. Anyone in peripheral areas of the business, like IT, just had to make do with what they had, and there weren't too many people doing high-fives over this decision. This became even more grating when the training suite was refitted with 27 brand new PCs. I think they were HP Compaq Evo D510s, those compact blocky ones that were the first ones people could realistically have on a desk under a CRT monitor, or stood on their side. So now every PC the legal staff used, even in training, had been updated to a brand new one, while everyone else was scrabbling to even get more RAM in their machines. People were not happy.

The training suite was on the 5th floor of another building. Space was tight so we'd rented that spot for training as it's less disruptive for training to be the one that's in a building 5 minutes walk away. This detail is important, because one morning I heard that there was a fuss over at the other building. Managers were involved and looking angry. It took until after lunch before one of the managers stopped by our office to let us know what had happened. The previous night someone had stolen 15 PCs from the training suite.

The HP Compaqs were small, but really all they'd done is fit things in very well. There wasn't less stuff in them, maybe more, so they weighed as much as a normal desktop. From personal experience I could just about carry 4 at once. It was dicey though, because they were heavy, and they stack up high-enough to block your face to see where you are going. From the security footage we knew it was one person, so think about that in relation to the theft. That one person stole 15 PCs, which means a minimum of 4 trips, but most likely 5, to the 5th floor and back down, and presumably to a van to put them in. It's so ballsy I wonder if it was the same person as before. Both scream inside-job, but this was a different building, and one we didn't operate the security for, just rented space in.

Although we were still in the early stages of the merger we were clearly told ""Don't tell the US"". As soon as he left our office, I immediately told the US. I called a guy over there I'd become friends with, I'll call him Adam. ""Hey Adam, guess what just happened here"". We had a chuckle about it, and I filled him in on the previous instance.

The next day I hadn't even made it to my desk before a very angry manager blurted out to me just because I was passing by him ""They stole the rest of them!"". ""The what?"" I asked, caught off by being thrown into a conversation I wasn't prepared for. ""The training PCs. They took the rest last night"". I couldn't wait until the time zones aligned and I could make that call. ""Hey Adam, you won't believe what happened last night"".",1,1622217316

2841,My Journey to IT (Part 2),"So I’m sitting at the front desk of our small office when I notice that the Owner, Owner’s Wife, Sales Manager and VP are having a meeting in Owners office. The Owner’s office had all windows so there was no secret meetings. They kept looking and pointing at me. Oh, Lord, what did I do?!? 

The week before we had run out of regular coffee and I wouldn’t be able to get more until the next day, but people still wanted coffee so I made only what we had, decaf. Yes, I know, I was young and dumb! I was afraid to say anything at the time and then most people in the office that day started to get a headache. Those were my ‘BC’ days...Before Coffee. Luckily I had two full bottles of aspirin. To this day only myself and a temp we had at the time know of the terrible decaf day of 1995. 

So I wasn’t sure what the deal was until they called me into the office: 

Owner (O): Hey bambam67, how’s it going? 

Me: Everything’s good. There’s fresh (and caffeinated) coffee brewed. 

O: We called you in today to assign you a project. 

Me: Oh, okay, what kind of project? 

The group looks at Owner and owner back to me. It made me a little nervous.

O: We have an opportunity to move from this building to a larger office space. 

Me: Okay. 

O: We’d need you coordinate the movers, new phone system, computer network and whatever else comes up. You need you to take point on this. 

Me: Wow, okay, what’s the timeframe? 

O: We have to move in by the end of the month. 

Me: Next month?

O: This month.

It was already the end of the first week of the month and would give me 3 weeks to get us moved in, ridiculous right?

Me: (laughing) Oh, you got me! That’s a good joke! 

Owner looks at me dead serious...

O: No joke. We have to move in by the end of the month or we lose the space. Can you do it?

Me: I can do it but we’ll need to bring in another temp to answer the phones and do the everyday stuff. I should really get started and start calling moving companies for quotes and availability, figure out what we need to do for phones and I need to go visit the space. This is a bit overwhelming. 

O: We have every confidence that you can do it. I also have contact info for one of our consultants who has experience with computer networks. 

I went straight to my work and 3 weeks later we were moving in to the new office space. I made an friend along the way, the network consultant (NC). NC was a consultant who didn’t like to fly. I have no idea how he got hired because all of our consultants had no choice but to travel. So instead of consulting for PeopleSoft he led the way to put together our office network, printing network and a bank of 30 modems in the server room so employees could dial in to check their email. Then NC and myself got called into a meeting with the owner:

O: I want to thank both of you for doing such a great job putting this all together. 

Me: Of course, it was tough but a good learning experience for me. 

O: We’ll, since we are growing so fast, we are going to need someone to be our Director of IT. NC, I’d like to offer that position to you, if you’ll take it. 

(Again, no, I didn’t expect to be offered the job, I was still learning about how the business ran and all the ins and outs of IT)

NC: I’ll take the position but...

O: But what?

NC: I’ll only do it if bambam67 comes with me to new IT group. 

O: Done! 

That moment changed my life. Not to mention a great ego boost. It was awesome to feel appreciated and awarded after such hard work. I became an IT Analyst and my career began. I took on many roles including webmaster, Lotus Notes programmer, Help Desk Supervisor and eventually Bay Area IT Manager...but those are stories for another time. 

Just a reminder to not belittle small beginnings and when opportunity presents itself, go for it and go after it! You never know to who or what it might lead to. 

Until next time my IT brothers and sisters...

2842,Why having the User comply with my instructions can't solve the problem,"This is another story from years ago when I provided tech support for a company of cheap pc clones that are no longer available in the United States, but which are still sold in other parts of the world.

Now to say that many of the purchasers of these computers were first time users is a vast understatement of the case. Many of my best stories from this time come from the nexus between bad hardware design, cheap customer service solutions and insanely novice users.

So sit right back and I'll tell you the tale of the mythical creature known as the user and his capricious and unpredictable ways.

First the usual disclaimers: I am on a computer, so completely responsible for the formatting. English is both my 1st and 3rd language, and my mother was a school teacher, so I am also completely responsible for my use of grammar and spelling. Although I do not care to hear about it if the spelling tends to vacillate between British and American standards. Or the punctuation for that matter.

Now get ready to hear about the face-palm smack hear 'round the call center.

Today I have a call from a user experiencing a standard problem with her new computer. This computer had a bad driver at the time of build and instead of re-imaging them with a good build with the correct drivers, the company had simply thrown a patch-fix floppy in the box and we routinely had to walk the user through the process of installing this to get their computers working properly. Just another sure sign that our company well and truly loves its customers....

So I help my caller identify the floppy disk with the patch-fix on it. I help her identify the floppy drive in her computer. I help her find the icons for her drives in the start folder (this was Windows 3.3) and we are ready to begin.

Me: ""So, let's put the floppy disk in the disk drive.""

Caller: ""It's in.""

Me: ""Okay now find the floppy disk on the screen.""

Caller: ""I see it.""

Me: ""Now put your mouse over the floppy disk and double-click.""

Caller: ""Okay.""

Me: waiting...waiting... ""So, what happens?""

Caller: ""Nothing's happening.""

Me: ""Okay. Is the mouse over the floppy disk?""

Caller: ""Yes.""

Me: ""And while the mouse is over the floppy disk you double-click?""

Caller: ""Yes.""

Me: ""But it isn't popping up the dos screen with the update?""

Caller: ""Nothing's happening.""

So we start all over again and walk through it again.

Caller: ""Nothing's happening.""

And again.

Caller: ""Nothing's happening.""

I'm running out of ideas. So very slowly, I step through the process again, and it is this time that I determine she is putting the floppy disk back in the drive, but I had never told her to take it out. I ask her why she had taken the floppy disk out of the drive?

Caller: ""So I can double click on it.""

Face-palm smack. Well, at least now I know why it isn't working. She had been putting the floppy disk in the disk drive, locating the icon for it on the screen, pulling the floppy disk back out, placing it on the table, placing her mouse over it and double clicking. And strangely, nothing was happening after.

So we tried it again, this time using expressions like ""Place your mouse pointer over the picture of the floppy disk on the screen and double-click"" and, yeah. The patch worked this time and she was able to start using her computer properly. 

Maybe next time we should just start by lighting a black candle or something?",1,1622211171
2843,How I managed to shut down the intranet of my company for 2 days,"This happened a few years ago. 

A bit of background: I work at a small bank in Germany. At the time we used a self made intranet for important messages, sharing documents and work instructions. I worked in controlling at the time and used Excel for many tasks. 

Now for the actual incident: we were about to take part in credit pooling for the first time. The company coordinating the pooling process send us some documents and Excel-files we needed for the process itself or afterwards. One of those files was a fairly big xlsm-file (Excel with macros). Since we were not the only department needed for the process we had to get the files to other departments. We didn't want to send the files via E-Mail because the E-Mail-storage was very limited. Since the document-sharing didn't check what kind of document you were sharing I figured out we could upload the files to our intranet. What I didn't know at the time was that the system checked all content of a document so the search engine would be able to find it easier. For pdf-, doc- or small xlsx-files this was not a problem. But the system crashed after I uploaded the big xlsm-file. It took a few minutes to actually crash fully so I didn't make the connection to my file at first. 

2 days later (after our intranet was running again) I get a call from the IT-department explaining that I was responsible for the crash and that they disabled the content reading feature for that file. 

There were no futher consequences for me since our intranet was not crucial for business. I still work there and am now part of the IT-department myself.",1,1622194324
2844,I want ONLY the internet on my tv to work.,"A year ago I did tech support for a TV company that also handled internet. I was a part of something called the advanced resolution team, meaning I had the power of a manager (credits, extra offers, and such) without the pay but got all the angry people who continued to call in. One day I got a call from a customer saying he was not able to download a show on his tv to play it back and his tv apps were not working. I go through all the normal questions. “Is everything else working? Is it only effecting internet related tv items?” So on and so forth. 

I begin my flow for internet issues and do the basic troubleshooting when I ask him to check his router and tell me what he saw. “There are no lights on my router.” Ok, let’s reset your router. 4 minutes later I asked if he saw any lights and he said he still saw no lights. “Alright sir, is anything else in your home experiencing internet issues?” He mentions the wifi on his phone isn’t working and neither is the internet on the computer. I halt my trouble shooting and explain I must transfer him over to our internet department due to his internet being down and his router not working properly.

The man began to laugh. “I don’t care if anything else has internet I just want my tv to have internet.” I let out a sigh I knew this was going to be a battle. I explained with his router not showing lights his internet was down and we could not put ONLY internet on his tv since his internet itself was not working. He got irritated and told me I didn’t want to help him and only wanted to pass him off because I didn’t know how to do my job. Again, I explain I can only troubleshoot tv tech issues and because of it being the internet the internet department needed to further assist him. 

At this point I’m so aggravated and have been getting yelled at for 7 straight minutes about how he only needs the internet on his tv and we control the internet. My supervisor comes over due to my call time being high at this point (after 15 minutes we would get a check in). I explain the issue and their only resolution is be a broken record. After 10 more minutes of explaining I can’t magically turn on the internet for only his tv I cold transferred him to the internet department, took off my headset, and sat under my desk for the next five minutes.


TLDR: mans internet is down and he thinks I can turn it on for only one device when his router wasn’t working.",1,1622168372

so, my family does a weekly quiz over zoom and one week grandma just cant join, at that time we were 10mins late so I give up and do it with her over the phone (we usually do it together anyway). I leave it until next week assuming zoom was being difficult as it usually is for her and the same issue arises

&amp;#x200B;

I called her the following day and helped her through the issue, we get to the point where we establish that it was the tablet itself with the issue and not zoom as I thought t was. I try to get her to install Teamviewer on the tablet and the play store says it wasn't connected to the internet (I then worked out that the wifi got turned off). I spend 10 mins trying to explain to her what the wifi symbol is

me - it's like a triangle

grandma - I don't see a triangle

me - like an upside-down bit of cheese

after about 15 mins of back and forth we eventually turn on wifi (Whatsapp video called her on her phone and tried to get her to flip the camera around (which took an additional 5 mins) and see the wifi symbol after assuming she accidentally swiped on the quick setting row. once we eventually get that turned on I got her to open zoom just out of curiosity as I thought that was just part of the issue

&amp;#x200B;

I open zoom on my laptop (which takes an additional 5 mins as my surface decided to log into zoom) and zoom her, at this point I had been on the phone for  3/4 of an hour at that time. once my pc eventually decided to log into zoom i called her

2847,But how do I use this website in Firefox?!?,"I had a professor who swore there was an invisible hook on the door to his classroom. Some people, upon walking through the door, had their common sense snagged and, while he was certain they were clever enough *outside* of his cursed classroom ... they became brain-dead upon entry. Sometimes my mom gets like that with computers. 

My mom liked to keep track of the pollen forecast. The forecast page, at some point, stopped rendering well in Internet Explorer.Not a big surprise, MS isn't even developing the program anymore. I suggested she use Firefox instead. How, she asked, do you use the page in Firefox? So I copied the URL from the IE bookmark, opened it in Firefox, and saved a bookmark. OK, she asked ... then what. 

Umm ... I don't know. I alt-tab'd back to IE and asked her what she did next there. Click on this. OK, alt-tab back to Firefox and showed her that she could still click that. Then what, she asked. I spent fifteen minutes alt-tabbing between the two browsers so she could show me how to use the page ""in IE"" so I could show her how to use it ""in Firefox"". Never *once* did she realize I was telling her exactly whatever she just told me.

To avoid repeat performances, I changed the bookmark so it went directly to the pollen and allergy forecast instead of the weather site's main page. She ended the day thinking Firefox was much better for seeing the pollen forecast because one click opened what she wanted.",1,1622152937

2850,Old Ways VS. Best Ways,"Posting via mobile, Yadda Yadda.

So ... my job ranged from helping old folks buy some home PC setup for Skyping their grand kids, to helping a boss buy maybe 1 server set and 20 machines. Not only would I listen to their needs, budgets, wants and then help choose their products, but sometimes I'd be sent to install the systems bought. To be clear, I was hardware and OS install only, MAYBE a third party software on special request. The idea was that as soon as the customer is logged in and online, the rest is up to them with a ""Good luck and thanks for your purchase, here's my card if you need something else.""

One day, I get a big score. A boss walked in and started evaluating the stuff we had on the shelf, you know, the cheap plastic of home PC garbage the chain wants to buy low and sell high en-masse. This is pretty normal but this guy is using a clipboard, pen, paper and one of the oldest calculators I'd ever seen, a Casio scientific with yellowed buttons and screen about the same size as a post-it note. I loved those things! Anyway, we get talking and I ask about the clipboard. He says he needs 12 PC's, one for him, one for a secretary, four for some artists, four for some draughtsmen (technical drawing for designing anything from cereal toys to car gear boxes), and the rest for Accounts and HR. I said no problem and went towards the big ticket items like Macs for the artists.

After a while, he'd filled in about five sheets of A4 before asking, ""Can I get these customised?""
""Yes, but that's probably going to take some more time to explain, more in-depth...""
""Oh that's no problem, how about you come to my office on Thursday 2pm and we can get to the brass of the situation?""
After checking with my manager, I'm highly encouraged to go and make an afternoon of it, there were plenty of others on the floor to cover me. 

Thursday rolled around and I get to the address; I stare in confusion. It's a building site and the concrete hadn't even been poured yet. I back up and park nearby to check my phone to make sure I have the address correct, it is, but I decide to ring the Boss. After a few seconds he waves me over from the Portacabin. Wiping my now-muddy office shoes as I get in, I ask what's going on, and the boss reveals that we're basically in his living room but it's not built yet. Next door will be the office, three floors, and that it's going to be an Architect company with his house as the flagship design. Where I live, it's not unheard of; a lot of businesses here in the UK behave like farmsteads or small-holdings, even if it's a specialty ice-cream cafe or plumber's supply warehouse or maybe a kitchen/bathroom showroom; the business owner is almost always living in line-of-sight and in close proximity of the business.

Ok, I nod in slow but sure understanding. He walks me over to the old fashioned way of doing things: lots of big office boxes, draughtsman's table, actual blueprints and mechanical pencils and pens, numerous highlighters and other stationary. He even has a fax machine set up! It was like walking into a living museum and I couldn't be happier. 

He points to a garage on the drawings and then to the room nextdoor. ""I want a server in there."" He then traces a finger from there to the building next door, not his house but the business. ""Then wires go through a pipe underground to receptionist,"" he points at an expansive lobby area, ""then up the walls and branches off to the different department...""

""Mind if I take photos for notes?""
""I trust you.""

Later on, I get back to my place of work and sit at my desk. I look at the jumble of towers and devices that had piled up for me to fix or upgrade while I was out. I'd do them the day after, it was already dark outside and I planned on getting home after reporting to my manager.

Basically, I was being asked to do something I'd never done before but I had a plan. Manager comes over and asks how I got on. ""Can you put me through PAT testing and installation stuff again? Like, yesterday?""
""Why? I thought you had that already?""
""I might need a refresher. He wants me to install cables and power and phone cables.""
""That's easy, though, you do it every day.""
""No... not like that... like this..."" I point to the big plastic cable conduits on the workplace wall.
""But... that's contractor stuff! You don't do that, we don't provide that kind of thing, we're not builders. I'm sorry, you'll have to decline this one, we're not covered for it.""

The next morning, I pick up the phone and give the guy the bad news. He wouldn't take no for an answer, though.
""When do you finish work?""
""7pm every day, 5 on Sundays. Why?""
""I see. What if you come to work for me at about 8? One day a week?""

Fast forward to the following Monday. I'm stood there in the mud, with wellies borrowed from boss for the evening, holding up my phone and him holding up the blueprint, pointing and wandering around the foundations. ""I think you'll need CAT5, maybe fibre-optic if you're ok with the budget, running through there and maybe up through that wall and ceiling there, power too, but I'm not an electrician...""
""Don't worry about that, just tell me what I need...""

Fast forward again another week and the skeleton of the building was already up, conduits set inside concrete with the proper shielding and some cables already tied in. He wanted to do things a bit differently, you see, most buildings in the UK have IT infrastructure built as an afterthought, conduits and cables trailing around in untidy fashion. He wanted this building to come alive, everything out of sight but highly functional and adaptable. The conduits were big enough so that the cables could be pulled out and rethreaded if necessary without ripping them out of the walls again, while ensuring that workstations worked like hospital beds, able to move and reinstall at whim.

Little did I know what else he was going to do.

Alongside the IT, he has filing cabinets built into the wall and this was a good thing because, a year later, an entire section of the county has a power cut for three days. I was still working for the boss as a part time IT professional... the business was small enough that I could remote in to a workstation or server for anything small, and local enough to just pop in (at night or early morning) for the more crucial stuff. On the day of the power cut, I got in as early as I could and checked the UPS units on each floor and let myself into the house (I was trusted with a key). Making sure doggo was ok with me being there first, I checked the server and compared the electricity supply news updates. Erring against caution, I decided to ensure backups were saved and shut everything down to complete blackout safely, taking the strain off the UPS.

For three days, I kept offering apologies to the boss; businessmen don't like it when their computers go down. Nevertheless, he was calm and kept waving me away. On the fourth day, the building suddenly hummed back to life and I felt better. After checking the network and individual machines were working properly again, I went back to boss and let him know. Finally, I agreed him why he was so calm. He showed me the filing cabinets hidden in the wall panelling in his office, then took me to the accountant's office where the same had been installed. The accountant even had a mechanical calculator, the kind with a massive crank handle and rolls of paper. The draughtsmen had their tables and stationary set up next to their computer desks. 

I was highly impressed and wondered why more businesses don't operate like this. 

A bit of a sad ending, though. The boss made his money and everyone was laid off with more-then-generous packages, he moved out to somewhere near Florence and the building was turned into some kind of yoga and ballet center. I wonder if they know they have a top notch network in the walls? Oh well.",1,1622137495

2852,Why are you using a candle?,"This story is from years ago when I provided tech support for a company of cheap pc clones that are no longer available in the United States, but which are still sold in other parts of the world.

Now to say that many of the purchasers of these computers were first time users is a vast understatement of the case. Many of my best stories from this time come from the nexus between bad hardware design, cheap customer service solutions and insanely novice users.

So sit right back and I'll tell you the tale of the mythical creature known as the user and his capricious and unpredictable ways.

First the usual disclaimers:  I am on a computer, so completely responsible for the formatting. English is both my 1st and 3rd language, and my mother was a school teacher, so I am also completely responsible for my use of grammar and spelling. Although I do not care to hear about it if the spelling tends to vacillate between British and American standards. 

Today's call you will never forget:

On this call, the caller complains that his computer no longer boots up. In checking his specs I note that it is one of the notorious riser board units. These are designed to use a smaller motherboard than most computers of the day, and this is done by only having one expansion slot on the motherboard, and then inserting into this slot a riser board with five or six expansion slots on it. This basically moves most of the expansion slot portion of the motherboard onto a daughterboard and changes the space requirements to make the computer smaller. But, in order to make the expansion slots on the daughter board compatible with all the cards out there, there are massive data and power connections between these two boards, resulting in an unstable situation where if the daughterboard shifts even a very small amount in its slot, it will ground out the entire computer and leave it unable to boot.

The solution? The correct solution would be to send a technician on site and have them remove and re-install the daughterboard and thus get the computer running again. The cheap customer service solution we are given instead is to walk the user through the process of opening the ridiculously complicated case, identifying the riser board, use a screwdriver to remove it and then re-insert it, put everything back together and hope it now works. Often it was a rinse-repeat sort of thing where the second or third time is the charm. These calls take a ridiculous amount of time and tend to make users uncomfortable as they are being called on to basically perform heart-surgery on their computer.

Never wanting to assume the hardest solution first, I start with basic things like checking if the computer is plugged into the wall, and having the user unplug the power cord from the back of the computer and from the wall and reconnect it to make sure it isn't loose anywhere. We also check the power and connection to the monitor to make sure nothing is hinky there. And so we step through all the basic troubleshooting, and it is now time to tackle the dreaded riser board issue. With more than the normal level of difficulty we get the case open. I am now describing the internals of the computer to him to help identify the motherboard and riser board, and the user says ""Hang on, I don't want to drip wax into the computer.""

Me: ""I'm sorry, did you say 'wax'?""

Befuddled User: ""Yeah. I'm using a candle to light the inside of the case.""

Me: ""Why are you using a candle?""

Befuddled User: ""Because the power is out.""

Me: (Face-palm smack) ""Did it not occur to you that you would need power to use the computer?""

Befuddled User: ""Sure. But it has a battery in it.""

And indeed it does. A WATCH BATTERY. a battery just strong enough to help the computer not forget the date and time when turned off and unplugged. And even so, these normally need to be replaced about once a year or the computer forgets what day it is.

I explain this to the user, but he doesn't want any part of it. He wants the computer to work during a power outage off of a small watch battery.

I apologize that I can't help him with that and then help him put the case back together again, after which he asks to talk to my supervisor. This was easy to accomplish. My supervisor and about three other people had been listening in on the call after it started to go long and well before we determine the source of his trouble is a power outage. They are still listening and generally having a good laugh at the Befuddled User's expense.

The supervisor comes and listens to the user's complaint, which isn't about me - he likes me - but all about the computer not working when the power is out. It was voted call of the week.",1,1622132147
2853,Sudden and unexpected outage,"Hi all. 

This was a while ago.  

Preamble: I wasn't the only person with access to the server room.  I hated this. I made it known it was very very bad form. Nobody cared. (Server room had air conditioning control panel for the entire building, and general IT storage).  Bosses didn't think security was important.

Anyway, the nuts and bolts of the story. Testing and tagging of all equipment had been ordered by another department. They (nice directors) pointed at the site, and set the electricians loose. The electricians made their way through the building with their nice stupid machine. They tested every electrical device they could find. and then found the server room. The nice electrician unplugged (hot unplugged) the c7000 blade server, the fibre SAN &amp; switch, all the network switches, the UPS'.... Everything.

Client: sure

2856,Asking a user to... reinstall windows?,"Hey there TFTS, long time no see!

I'm now doing tier2 support for a large company and, well, let me tell you about this ticket I've received this week from one of our tier1 techs...


Ticket was opened for $UserA


Title: ""Windows Update problem - UNDO changes""


Description: What seems to be a copy-paste of the content of a received email from someone complaining about the ""printscreen"" key not working on their keyboard, signed $UserB.


Troubleshooting: ""I advised the user to reinstall Windows, but he says he is a new employee and doesn't know how to do that. I referred him to Confluence and the Teams community.""


Mind you, we aren't an IT company. Our employees are nowhere close to IT consultants; they are just your basic average user. And to my knowledge, we have no such thing as a Confluence or Teams community telling users how to... reinstall Windows.
So I take a chance in calling $UserA, because the ticket is in his name.

Discussion with the user reveals that.. 
- The **actual** problem was his computer bluescreened and would since constantly boot into Windows Startup Repair.
- This was already solved by another tier1 tech in another ticket, and was now fully functional.
- There was ALSO a third ticket, opened by yet another tier1 tech for other OS-related issues, to change the computer, already being taken care of.",1,1622128014

2858,My Journey to IT (Part 1),"This is a story how one simple computer support request changed my life.

I’m not sure about you but I didn’t start out with a career in IT. I went to college, earned a science degree but not for computers, it was for Geography. I know, I know, my cred probably just fell a few notches but I did have a minor in computer cartography (map making). 

I should back this up a bit. (Harp sounds in the background) It was the late 1970’s and my dad brought home a box from the store. He worked for a large oil and gas company and was always trying to keep up with the latest technology. 

The box contained a computer, but not just any computer, it was a TRS-80 from Radio Shack. This computer was also known as the ‘Trash-80’ or the ‘Crash-80’, and yes, it definitely earned that nickname. I learned some BASIC and learned how to hook it up and a lot of restarts. 

We updated to a system that just did either word processing or spreadsheets called PeachTree. Then we moved up to a 286 computer and then the fast 386. All the while I’d help setup each station and play around with the old one. I ended up taking that 386 to college to do papers and play games (loading 18 disk to play a single game). All that to say that growing up with computers was just normal for me. 

While going to graduate school I was getting bored. My classes were at night and I’d finish my homework fairly quickly. I figured I could work during the day and do school at night. I got a job as a temp at a consultant company. They were consultants for PeopleSoft software. As I was checking expense reports vs the receipts, the owners wife (OW) walks in the room and asks to the half dozen people in the room (including me):

OW: Hey, can anyone put this together? 

Me: What is it? 

OW: It’s a computer. (the crowd quickly lowered their heads)

Me: Sure, I can do it. 

OW: Are you sure? (Not looking at me with confidence)

Me: Yes, I’m sure. I’ve done it before. 

She left me the box and I started taking out all the parts and started to put it together. It seemed simple to me. Back then each mouse, keyboard and video chord could only be put in its own special port and some systems were color coded. It took me about ten minutes to open, put together and turn it on. I went back to checking expense reports as OW walked by...

Me: OW, your computer is ready. 

OW: What? 

Me: Your computer, I’m done setting it up. See, it’s turned on and ready to go. 

OW: Already? Oh, okay. (She stops as if to ponder) Thanks for doing that. Are you here for a bit? 

Me: I’m just working on these reports. I’ll be here. 

OW walks back towards the owners office and I get back to work not really thinking that something was happening. OW walks back to me. 

OW: So bambam67, how would you like to work here full time?

I was hired as the Office Manager. I know, you think I was going to be hired as their IT guy but I wasn’t, I was the Office Manager which included duties such as working at the front desk, answering phones, making coffee, shipping and receiving, maintaining office supplies...oh and any occasional computer stuff.

I setup our consultants with:

Toshiba Satellite laptop, there was no mouse pad, the mouse was a roller ball that you would attach to the right side of the keyboard. I actually still have one and it still works bringing up Windows 3.1.

200mb free on the drive (used Stacker to get to 400mb) 

Installed PeopleSoft and Office 95 

There was 20mb left on the hard drive. Tons of room for Word docs!! I cringe now just thinking about it. 

I worked as the Office Manager/Front Desk/IT for about a month when it happened...the owner wanted to move the office...that was the second thing that changed my career path forever. I’ll talk about that in Part 2!",1,1622124882
2859,"Computer says ""no signal""","Back in the mid 2000s I was technically an intern building PCs at a small computer shop, but in reality I did everything from picking up parts from our supplier to shipping and dealing with customers and troubleshooting, and even did the weekly garbage run. 

It was around the time when many businesses here in Norway started to move their stuff from physical locations to online services - everything from banks to government functions - and lots of people were starting to pick up their first PC out of necessity rather than interest.

I get to work and find that I have a build order for one of our basic PCs. I build it, test it, pack it up, and call the customers as they wanted to pick it up at the store.

I happened to be at the front desk when they came to pick it up, and it turned out to be an elderly couple so I offered to put everything in their car for them - those cheap steel boxes were heavy back then! Apparently they would get help to set it up at home.

Just as I'm about to leave work for the day I get called to the office and I'm told there's a problem with the computer I built earlier that day. The elderly couple is on the phone and I take the call:

Me: Hi, I heard you were having a problem with your new computer?
Them: Yes, you forgot to include the antenna!
Me: I... um, I am pretty sure there wasn't supposed to be an antenna? It didn't have wifi.. 
Them: There has to be, the computer says it isn't getting a signal! 
Me: Did you connect everything? Are all the lights on? Did you figure out all the cables?
Them: Yes, everything is connected, it's just not getting the signal!

I'm not a phone support guy, and this elderly couple does not appear to be sufficiently comfortable with this new contraption to go through troubleshooting by phone anyway. I also know it'll be a hassle for them to pack everything back up and return to the store (normal store procedure). I ask them where they live and it's not a terrible detour for my drive home so I offer to drop by and take a look.

When I get there everything looks fine at first glance - until I realize that the tower isn't anywhere to be found. Huh. The monitor is saying ""no signal"" because there's nothing - other than the mouse and keyboard plugged into the integrated USB hub - connected to it.

Me: Hey, uh, where's the PC?
Them: *blank stare*
Me: The big black box?
Them: Oh, so there *is* something missing?! 

I then remember that I carried everything to their car, put the monitor and accessories in the back seat, and put the PC itself in the trunk. I go out to their car, find the PC where I left it, and bring it inside. A couple of minutes later it's running and I get it connected to their internet service. I realize that they'll need a bit of a crash course to get started and I offer to show them how the basics work. They gladly accept, but insist on serving me dinner first. I got home pretty late that day, but I never charged them anything for it. The food was good, they were nice, and for years afterwards they'd send their friends and family to our shop to buy computers.",1,1622085615
2860,Don't leave your ~$2500 gaming rig unsupervised with a 8-year old.,"Not exactly a qualified technician, but I do know quite a bit about PCs.

One time I received a message from my friend, telling me that his little brother screwed up his gaming rig. The PC was a hand-me-down from his father, costing around \~$2500 in 2007ish. For its time the rig was a beast. Rocking a QX6800, 6 gigs o ram, and 2 GTX 275s in SLI. Note that this was in 2019, so the rig wasn't exactly up-to spec anymore.

I asked him what was screwed up, and he told me that when he went back into his room, he saw that his PC was stuck in a boot loop.

So I went to his home, took the PC to the living room, opened it up. Re-seated the RAM, no change, checked the CPU socket, no bent pins. Went through most of the steps, no change.

Then I went into the BIOS and lo and behold, his brother had somehow set the CPU multiplier to 13, had set the FSB to 300 or something, vcore to 1.6v (note that this was above the safe voltage specified by Intel). The mobo was a cheapo, VRMs were barely able to handle the QX6800's 130w TDP, so the poor VRMs were cooking. Luckily I fixed it before anything bad happened to the PC.

Then I realized that it was a ASUS mobo, and googling the model number gave me a list of specs.

One piece of software that caught my eye was ASUS Ai Suite. He had it installed, and used to it set ""power modes"". It could also change advanced settings, like the FSB and multiplier. So his brother went and messed with the settings and pressed apply, the PC restarted.

Told him to lock the PC when he isn't in the same room as the PC.

2861,"Doc surrounds himself with idiots, blames software support.","Gotta rant on this one:

So my last call of the day today was a doctor at an office we sold 3 systems to a couple months back, and he immediately starts laying into me:

DrKevin (obligatory not his name):
‘It’s been nothing but problems since we purchased this system, you guys fix it and it breaks a day later... we spent thousands of $ on a system that doesn’t work... were losing thousands of $ cuz we can’t take X-rays.. etc.’

Then he tells me to call the office back in 5 mins to talk to his assistant. Awesome, dude literally just wanted to complain. 

So I call the office immediately cuz otherwise I’d risk getting another call and not be able to call out at all, and after explaining that to the bitchy receptionist who said ‘doc told you to call back in 5 mins’ she put me on hold. While waiting i peruse the notes for all 3 offices. 

Not even joking, 100% of the calls we’ve logged that were actual issues are user related and/or Network related. As software we support, we don’t manage anything with network. We ping, flushdns, and tell users to enter their network creds. That’s about the extent of what we’re allowed to do because.. well, *SOFTWARE* support. Period. 

Examples of the calls?

- client workstation won’t connect to the database. Server is 192.168.1.x and client is 10.1.10.x. Entirely different networks. ‘But you guys fixed it just the other day!’ Note from that day reads my colleague chose the correct office WiFi and you entered the password. ‘It is the right WiFi!’ Then I don’t know what to tell you. Call your IT. 
- IT called us because the office is saying they can’t take xrays, admits that they’ve been in process of overhauling their network. Thru discussion, it’s determined the can’t connect to the device because they *removed* the router that enables the device to connect, didn’t think it served any purpose. Ignorance is bliss. Can’t blame em too much for not knowing, but I truly don’t understand the umpteen calls we got after we clearly explained the purpose of the router, all related to the router not being present. 
- last Thursday, office calls cuz they can’t take xrays. Tech has caller reboot the panel. After 3 reboots with no change, it’s discovered caller is rebooting the *wrong thing*. She pushes the right button and they’re back in business. 

Which leads me to my call today. Same chick from last Thursday, and not surprisingly, exact same reason for calling. Device isn’t powered on. She *admits* it was exactly what she went thru on Thursday. Then asks, ‘could it be my iWatch? Cuz they didn’t have any problems before I started filling in here, I normally work at the other office...’ no Karen, you’re iWatch has nothing to do with the power button. 

So she powers it on, and it immediately powers itself back off after displaying a low battery. ‘Ok, switch the batteries, Karen’. Then all is good. 

Then Karen asks, ‘I took xrays today can you get them back?’ Of note: this particular IR does have internal storage, but: ‘no Karen, the device was off when you took the images. There’s literally nothing can be done about that.‘

AND THEN she asks, ‘so how can we prevent this issue?’ 

.....

I.....

oh yeah, you bet your ass I told my boss to let sales know to deny *ANY AND EVERY* demand for refunds or discounts cuz the way the doc was talking, I feel it coming.

2867,Guy who builds computers for a living destroys his cheap name brand computer.,"This story is from years ago when I provided tech support for a company of cheap pc clones that are no longer available in the United States, but which are still sold in other parts of the world.

Now to say that many of the purchasers of these computers were first time users is a vast understatement of the case. Many of my best stories from this time come from the nexus between bad hardware design, cheap customer service solutions and insanely novice users.

I get a call from a young man who introduces himself by declaring that he builds computers for a living. (I ask myself, ""Why if you have the ability to build a computer would you ever buy one of these cheapo systems?"") After purchase, he wants to boost the video and bought an add-in VGA card. Installing such a card is easy, but sometimes you have change a jumper or a dip switch on the computer's motherboard to get the computer to recognize and use the new hardware. 

For those who don't remember such things, dip switches are like little, tiny light switches that can be turned on and off with the tip of a pin. Pin jumpers are little pieces of plastic that can be placed over two pins to create a closed circuit, or removed to break the circuit. Pin jumpers are cheaper, so that's what we use. Some of our computers at this time have literally 50 or more jumpers and if you open or close the wrong circuit, it will render the computer unusable without a technician to put things back the way they should be. We had one case of an OCD ADD teenager who had been swapped out twice on his computer after pulling every single jumper off the motherboard, and when he did it for the third time, they bought his computer back from him and banned him from ever buying another one in his life. But that's a different story. 

So it is not unusual on our computers of the day to need to change a jumper pin configuration for the computer to recognize and use an add-in video card. And knowing this, the young man checks the schematic for the motherboard and the motherboard itself, but cannot identify which jumper does that. But he does see a chip labelled ""VGA"", and so he extracts this chip, but now his computer no longer boots at all.

This is a real forehead-smack moment for me. First, his model is designed to auto-detect an add-in video card and turn off the on-board video as soon as you boot it up with an add-in card installed. He did not need to change anything for his new graphics card to work. Second, the only chip on his motherboard that had VGA written on it is his CMOS BIOS chip. For those of you who don't actually build computers for a living, this is the only part of the computer that has programming when you first turn a computer on. Its job is to make sure everything needed is there for the computer to work, and then looks for and loads the more extensive programming normally stored on the hard drive that gets you doing all the other fun things a computer can do. By removing this chip, he had essentially rendered his computer brain dead. And because it is a flashable CMOS of the EEPROM type, the chip itself was destroyed by the process of removal. Any programming it had contained had been erased by the process. It could not be re-installed and then made to work. The only viable solution for this issue is a full motherboard replacement. And since what he has done also completely voids his warrantee, he has to pay for the parts and labor himself. 

Needless to say, he is none-too-happy with this result. He escalates it up to my supervisor and then my manager, but I leave extensive notes and it remains a non-warrantee repair.

After not being able to get to the bottom of the issue over the phone, I went over to their office to observe them replicating the issue.

They were typing and all appeared normal and then when they went to type ""T"" they violent twisted and slammed their left hand down, also clicking in the trackpad.

User did not accept that explanation and was very insistent that I replace the internal keyboard. I politely refused but offered them an external keyboard that was identical to the internal one. They declined. The user also used an external mouse so I offered to simply disable the trackpad and showed them how to toggle it on and off. They also declined that.

Me, already guessing it's a PS2 keyboard, asks him to send over a pic.

And yup the pic confirms it's a PS2 keyboard
so I respond

&gt; Me: oh hey that's a PS2 keyboard (unrelated to the PS2 console)

&gt; W: yeah it randomly stopped working the other day, I tried unplugging it and plugging it back in and it doesn't work

&gt; Me: wait, PS2 isn't hotpluggable

W is confused.

So, I explained it to him and told him to do the ol' ""Turn it off and turn it back on again""

&gt; Me:  unplug that keyboard of yours, turn off your computer, plug it in, and then turn it back on

W is a bit confused as everything else like USBs and Monitors can be plugged in while the computer is on, but agrees to try 

A few minutes later, I get this message
&gt; W: OMG it's working again! (with some shocked emojis)

&gt; Me: haha, now you know PS2 isn't hotpluggable

&gt; W: Thank you so much I don't have to buy a new keyboard!

So yeah, A PS2 keyboard saved from the dump, and W saves a few bucks from having to buy a new keyboard

Still don't know why it randomly stopped working in the first place though.

2873,When my attempt to protect the computer went completely backwards...,"So, this wasn't at work, but it was the family's iMac that we all shared.

There were some thunderstorms in the area, and nobody was actively using this computer. Twice, the lights had flickered during the storm so I was concerned about data loss from an uncontrolled power loss or dip, or damage from a lightning strike. 

Since no one was using the computer anyway, I proceeded with an orderly shutdown, and only then did I unplug the power cord from the back. There was no network cable, or anything else that lead to an outside connection.

We had gone on vacation the next day, and been gone for several days.

We came back and my sister plugged in the iMac and tried to turn it on. Nothing, no fan, lights, or startup sound. Hmm, try another power cord? Another outlet? Unplug everything except power and try it that way? No dice. It's completely inoperable. Unfortunately, Macs in particular don't really share that many parts between models except the most similar ones of the same year and model, so swapping parts wasn't really an option. Not to mention accessing the power supply itself. So, we took it to the repair shop.

Unfortunately, they found that the motherboard had died. Yeah, somehow the motherboard, not the power supply, just up and died when we tried to start the thing up again. I've seen a power supply just die on startup after a really long hiatus (read: hasn't been used in months or years) but a motherboard? That was new to me. Though I suppose in the grand scheme of things, a majority of hardware failures in general occur during startup, not while running.",1,1621970499
2874,Local shop tried to charge poor woman $300 just to look at her flash drive that only needed the connector soldered back on.,"I run a small all inclusive computer repair business. This includes component level motherboard and appliance repair, all the way to network and security help. Just about everything. I was an electrical engineer before doing this so I'm able to do repairs many people aren't.


I got a call from a woman that her flash drive is broken.

Me: Hello there! So do you know what happened to the USB drive?

Her: My kid put it in his mouth. Now it won't read anything on the drive.

Me: well I would have to look at it but most likely, if the data is very important to you you should send it to a recovery service. 

Her: That's what the other shop said but they said they would charge $300 just to collect it and send it in and then charge more on top of that if they get the data off.

Me: I see, do you know what kind of flash drive it is?

Her: I don't know, it's from Amazon and it doesn't have a brand name.


This is a problem, because if I cannot find an exact replacement with the exact same controller and revision, I likely won't be able to switch out the controller IC. 

Me: Well, I don't charge if I don't fix your problem, so bring it on by. 

Because the other shop was a reputable shop with good reviews, I had assumed they had done their due diligence. My assumption was that the drive had no obvious issues and that trying to recover the data was going to be a pain in the ass.

It turns out that the other shop either had a bad day, or just doesn't know anything about soldering... 

She arrived with the drive, and I notice the USB connector is very loose. It's held in by the plastic housing of those bulk cheap flash drives you find on Alibaba. 

I break open the plastic and I see that the USB connector has sheared off and broken two of the four pads. This is the best case scenario! 

Me: Hey, I don't think you need to send this off to get repaired. I think the drive itself is intact, the USB connector just shared off. It's kind of the best case scenario, but I'm surprised the other shop didn't already do this for you.

It took me about 10 minutes to solder back on three of the four leads on to the pads and one of them had ripped off so I ran a jumper wire to a capacitor that was along the same 5v input and the drive showed up in Windows. It was very wonky but it worked. I pulled her files off of it and put it on one of my disposable drives (I get decent quality drives in bulk for customers data) and handed it back.

I did not charge, but she ended up tipping me $50 anyway.",1,1621964139
2875,"Exec getting angry because she has been receiving calls from our critical situation alerting system over the past week, but she's on on any critsit or on-call teams.","This is one of the most absurdly hilarious things I've seen at my current job.

A high-level marketing exec (very  high in the company but not at the VP level, or we wouldn't be dealing  with her direclty) is understandably very angry because she's getting  calls at all hours on her mobile from our CritSit system that alerts on-call engineers of failures/emergencies in the  hardware/software/infrastructure.  There are a couple of hundred teams  involved, and probably a thousand or two engineers in the on-call  system.  I'm in there, but in five years have only been called twice and  once was an area of business I'm not part of.  (Though I did respond, and collected some sweet sweet overtime.)

She  is NOT one of the people who is on call.  Hence, angry and verymuch  WTF-fy.  She has received a bunch of text-to-speech voicemails all sounding very  urgent -- but they triggered her well-developed ""this is not legit, I  should notify security"" detectors.  (The company from time to time and  without announcement sends phishing emails to different groups to find  out who might fall for one. Awareness of the issue is ""above average""  here, I would say.

We went round  and round over this.  It looks an awful lot like a phishing attack.  The  grammar and spelling are characteristic of a well-known region of the  world (not Nigeria) where a lot of suspect emails come from.  It says  it's reporting a problem with a particularly popular X.500 database --  also a product of the company -- but the team it references doesn't  exist.  ""$X500 Prod"" where $X500 is the name of the popular database  system and ""Production"" is a common name for an instance of said  database product.  We just don't have an instance named that.  It would  be some kinda sophisticated attack that knows what critsit alerting  system we use, and thinks it knows which database system we use  internally -- but gets the instance name wrong and targets someone whose  technical knowledge would probably fit on a single glossy brochure for  whichever products she works with in marketing.

It  took us days to find out who is responsible for the alerting system.   It took a further two days to convince them to help us find the target's  name somewhere in the on-call lists in the system.  They kept insisting  that it was some kind of phishing or social engineering attack and not  coming from our system. Anyway, they relented and searched for her name  and/or phone number.

Nope.  Her name and her phone number are not anywhere in the system.  The ""This is an attack"" faction is gaining support...

We  can see that these calls originated from outside our telephone  network... but that doesn't help.  The exit-point for the alerting  system is external for obvious reasons -- you can't report a problem  with the phone system if you have to use the phone system to report it.

Then  I see an email:  ""Why does $teamName have $phoneNumber as their on-call  number?""  I look at $phoneNumber and see that it is our company's  front-door main corporate phone number.  $teamName is the name of the  team that manages the critsit alerting system.   Epiphanies and  revelations abound.

It turns out  that $Someone set the oncall number for a test environment of the  alerting system to our corporate main line. You know.  ""For testing.""   $Someone is from a part of the world where the characteristic  grammatical mistakes often found in phishes and spams are common.  They  reproduced the text of the alerts from memory.

There's  no shame or shade intended here -- English is a very difficult  language, and this part of the world has had English as part of its  elementary school curriculum for centuries.  Long enough to have  developed a peculiar and characteristic set of grammatical  inconsistencies.  In many parts of this region, different dialects of  the local language are difficult for people of other dialects to  understand, so English is the ""Lingua Franca"" for many of these fine  folk. (Yes I did that on purpose because it's fun to tease the French.)

$phoneNumber  is answerd by a sophisticated phone menu system that accepts voice as  well as dial-pad entry.  Apparently, it  was interpreting the recorded  message from our alerting system as (somehow)  ""Please direct this call  to $person"" -- the now substantially less-angry Marketing exec.",1,1621954680

The saga continues. Today's call goes like this:

Accountant: Hey, I know you gave us a link with affordable PCs with top-level specs that will keep us going for several years at a pretty decent price, but Random Guy who volunteers sometimes thinks we can get fancier all-in-one machines so we can save some space and make the office look more high end.

Me: Uh... Ok. Are the specs on said all-in-ones comparable to the machines I sent you? Is the price comparable?

Accountant: Oh, no. We haven't found any yet. We were wondering if you could look and find some.

Me: Uh, no. 1) I do not recommend all-in-ones for a non-profit. You need the flexibility to replace defective parts as time goes by. 2) Your budget is tight. The fancy all-in-one units you are asking about are generally more expensive than the \*mini\* towers I sent you. 3) I already did all this work for free, if someone else thinks they can do a better job, by all means, let them have at it.

Accountant: So, you won't help us anymore?

Me: Nope. And don't call me back when whatever machines you decide to order arrives either because this time, I'll bill at my regular rate. Have a nice day.

Ok, so I was a lot more gentle than that, but you get the point. 

I told them to let the guy (not an IT professional - I think he has a project management cert of some kind but works as a real estate agent) choose the machines he thinks they should have. They put me on the phone with him and I repeated my reservations and did him the courtesy of telling him what he should look for in a machine, but honestly, I think he is looking for pretty rather than functional.

2878,Why actually work with excel if you can print it out and fill it in by hand?,"This just happened. I'm not a native english speaker btw so apologies if I use confusing terms. I'm not tech support or even IT, I'm simply the youngest person in my department and have the most tech related knowledge. So I'm usually in charge of implementing any kind of documents or processes in SAP, Access or Excel etc.

**M: Me,  P: tech illiterate coworker.** 

A coworker just came to me and asked me to redo and simplify the excel sheet we use to track how many covid tests we give out every day/week. P seems to be complaining about how inefficient it is and that she doesn't understand it. She's the temporary stand-in for me because I have the next two weeks off. To clarify, its literally a table with three columns and a bottom row summing up column B and C respectively. (A is for the date, B is for the amount of tests given out each day, C is for how many positive cases we have).

So, because I don't really know what's supposed to be so hard about typing in a number into a cell, I walk over and ask what the problem is.

**M**: Hi P, I heard you have trouble with the covid list?

**P**: Yes! The list makes no sense. Why did you only put one field for the sum? It's totally inefficient because now I have to print out a new page every day!

**M**: What? Why would you print it out? It's sums it up automatically.

**P**: What do you mean? 

**M**: Ok explain to me how you intended to go about it.

**P**: Sure. I print it out and write the numbers into the fields. then after each day I add it up and write the total in the last row. But I have to print out a new one every day. That makes no sense!

Cue me explaining that in Excel you can type a number into a cell and the SUM-function adds up the numbers automatically, you don't have to use a calculator. And no you don't have to print it out, you just leave it in the group share folder where it's already in. And no, you don't have to send the thing as a printed out version to our boss because she has access to the document and can check it whenever.

2880,That’s a lot of paper…,"I have been in IT tech support for a really long time and one of my first jobs ever was in supporting a US government agency to transition from Windows 3.11 to Windows 95. 

Back then everything we had was rudimentary by modern standards. And one thing we had was a primitive version of email designed for purely internal communication. I was in front line user support and I was called to the office of a VP level user one day. 

She was concerned about the email. 

We had a text based mainframe driven email system that we loving called “Blue Mail” mostly because it had a simple text and cursor based GUI that was blue. We had just upgraded her to Windows 95 and along with it came a new sleek actual GUI based email client (Banyan BeyondMail 3.0 for the nerds) but even though it used the same messaging system the VP was very change resistant. 

So she called for help. 

Now everyone at the user help desk knew this VP was actually a PITA so they kept bumping the ticket until the snot nosed 19 year old college intern got the ticket. So up I went. When I got there she claimed that someone had sent her an email and she couldn’t find it in the new client. (Remember that, when people followed up emails with calls saying “I sent you an email”) So she dropped into blue mail, and there it was. 

I tried explaining that our network was fragile and so we used a 10 minute cycle to avoid network issues and she looked at me like I was speaking in tongues. I tried explaining that blue mail was a live client and was actually hosted on another system (mainframe) and it only delivered email on the cycle. Now I was speaking in tongues encoded in base64. 

So I said you need to wait about 10 minutes for emails to arrive. She was very unhappy. And concerned that her emails were going to go missing. So she asked me to set her up with a printer and I obliged and she then wasted months of the governments time and money printing emails out in paper so she “wouldn’t lose them”.

She took a buyout about 8 months later when people figured out that she was useless. I was among the people that cleaned out her office as reclaiming computer equipment was a shit job and guess who gets those. We found almost 20 bankers boxes filled with printed emails. None of it was worth keeping. She easily made in the high 100k range. And she spent all this time doing this to look busy so she could get 6 years pay to walk away. She probably ended up getting a high paying consulting gig after while I was making 8 bucks an hour.",1,1621896997
2881,My internet doesn't work!,"In 2013 I was working at a proctor's desk at my University's Media Labs. It wasn't technically a tech support position, more customer service. It would be my job to rent out some audio visual equipment, put money on print accounts, answer some questions and do some basic troubleshooting with known software issues or with logins. If it was hardware related, or a deeper issue it was my job to call IT Services.

Anyway it was my favourite time of year, September, when the new crop of kids would arrive and almost immediately have issues. So a student comes up to me and says ""Hey, umm... My internet doesn't work. Could you help me out? I've been trying for 15 minutes now and nothing.""

Sure, easy enough.

My first thought was the the network cable was unplugged. It was common that the cable management under the desks sucked and occasionally one cord or another would get unplugged by someone's foot. So I get the kid to show me to his computer. I noticed the monitors were blank, but on, so I figured it might have gone into sleep mode or something. 

Anyway, I get under the desk and have a look at the cables and everything's as it should be. I unplug and repulsed the Ethernet cable, just in case it wasn't seated correctly. I get out from under the desk and tap a key on the keyboard to get wake the computer up. 

It doesn't wake up. I jiggle the mouse, and nothing. I then look at the front of the machine and see that the damn thing isn't turned on. I think to myself, maybe he got frustrated and shut it down? So I reach down and and turn on the power.

Immediately the kid lets out a very embarrassed sounding ""Ooooooohh! Fuuuu..."" 

I look over at him and he's beet red, and clearly mortified. I don't say anything, I just give him a quick nod. He thanks me and takes a seat and I leave the lab and go back to my desk.

I sit there and ponder his initial interaction with me and his reaction when I turned on the machine. 

I can't understand how he associated the computer not being powered on with the internet not working. I also questioned the ability of the program's admission teams.

2887,Our very brightest student?,"Some years ago I worked in a government agency. We had a partnership with a nearby university where we would take a small number of their best students for a placement year. This was good for the students because they were pretty nailed on to get a full time job on completing their degree; after all they sere security vetted for their placement year, understood the requirements of the laws on the information they had been exposed to and had experience of the systems. It was good for us as we could observe them over what was effectively a 12 month interview and aptitude test.

Then there was that one student, the one who slipped through the net. Not malicious but a complete idiot. We used to have team nights out every so often, a few beers, a meal and then a few more beers. This was the guys Achilles heel, he couldn't hold his drink. One night we headed out for the team beers and towards the end of the evening he realised he had left his ID pass in the office. Not a big problem, you turn up at the security gate, the guards ask for your details, drag your manager down to  the gate to ID you and you get given your pass back or you get escorted to your desk to retrieve it. 

The problem was this guy didn't want the dressing down so thought it would be a good idea to slip into the site that night. He headed to part of the perimeter of the site which was surrounded by a wall and climbed up a tree and onto the wall. Hung down from the wall and let go landing inside the perimeter. The wall was about 3.5 metres in height but the landing was onto grass. He got up and set off limping to the office and went in. You might wonder how we knew he was limping? Simple really, we got to see the video recording of hem going up the tree, onto the wall and dropping down. We go to see him stop for a leak near the office and then wander into the office building. We then saw the team of guards heading into the office building and we got to see him escorted out to the gate house where he was handed over to the Police. He was detected before he even shinned up the tree and was covered by Infra Red cameras all the way along his journey.

This is where the tech support side of the story kicks in. Of course he was thrown off the placement and I understand off his degree course. I got the job of looking over his files  on his laptop to see if there was any unauthorised content or any possible exfiltration of data. There were a number of word processor files with interesting file names, but they were all encrypted and that was my area of interest. I was anticipating having to use some of the more interesting tools we had on the files but thought I might give some of the obvious passwords a try. The first thing to try is always a little social engineering; do you know their do and I had a quick think back over our interactions of the previous few weeks. It took just one attempt and using ""f\*\*\*off"" did the job. The files were absolute comedy gold. He had written up an ""appraisal"" of the technical skills of everyone in the team and highlighted where he felt his skills were far and away ahead of ours. His appraisal of me was superb, he went into great detail about how I had very little knowledge of how to keep data secure and that my chances of ever breaking anything he had encrypted were next to none. Once we had made sure that anything sensitive was redacted then files were handed over to the university along with the comment ""tubist61 guessed the password for the encryption on the very first attempt"".",1,1621866432

I: Huh, that's odd, just yesterday everything was working fine. Can you check if anything is not plugged in?

U: already did, looks fine, no unplugged cables.

I: ok... Does the computer make any noise or beeping when you hit the button or is it just completely silent?

U: it's completely silent. But the led is blinking.

(I realised this was a stupid question because of passively cooled PCs with SSDs but the user was helpful there)

I: ok, do other users have this problem or just you?

U: just me. Screen is black, nothing.

(I tried to think about what I was doing differently to this machine, I had no idea, but I realised that by shutting everything down I might have confused the user a little)

I: ok, User, have you turned on the monitor?

U: huh? No, it turns on by itself, how do I do that?

(Ah, there it is :D the old monitor always went to standby but yesterday I just turned it off, whoops)

I: yeah no problem, put your finger on the bottom right corner of the screen, and move it along the bottom side of the screen to the left. You should feel a bump. Just push on that bump.

U: ok... Oh, yeah, there it is, it's working, thank you!

Said goodbye and hang up.

I proceeded with brushing my teeth, wondering if I really just had to explain to somebody how to turn on their monitor...


TL;DR: turned off the monitor after setup of a new machine. The next morning I had to explain to the user how to turn it back on.",1,1621851813
2893,Hardware conflict.,"Just curious. I did tech support for a major internet provider back in the late 90s (dial up) days. It was kind oi saying that went around the call center. Rarely used on the customers. I had put in my 12 weeks notice at this point. I had a customer after a  frustrating half an hour call.  He kept getting ahead of me, not following my instructions, having to start all over 4-5 times because I had little idea where he was at.. I finally told the man"" I am sorry sir. but we seem to have hardware conflict between the seat and the keyboard, I can no longer help you"" and hung up.  Is this still a saying? We used to put it in the history on occasion as code for pita customer.",1,1621800107
2894,"A lot of printing, problem.","I was the manager of several departments but not initially of IT in a company of about 100 people.  I was the most computer competent manager so IT was transferred to me after the previous manager convinced all of the staff to leave (story for another day).  This meant I had to hire new staff with almost no budget and had to do some IT myself but IT was not my focus which is how this problem wasn't solved earlier.

We had a large printer that had all the latest bells and whistles and could spit out reams of paper very quickly.  We also had a technology challenged HR person (whom I also have a few stories on) that was hired and reported directly by the CEO for unexplained reasons and often worked late.  This concludes the background and players.

I am often the first person to arrive in the morning and on this printer I find 100+ pages of a resume left behind.  Resumes contain personal information so I pitched them into the locked shredding box, no thinking required.  Later in the week I meet with the CEO and he was also in early and he fumes at me saying the HR person left employee salary information on the printer, just venting, not my problem so I pay it little heed, but I see a 5 cm stack of paper that the CEO was pointing at.  Now I hear on the grapevine that engineers have found stacks of resumes abandoned on the printer several times and had to toss them into shredding, there is a pattern, but I am too distracted to see it, until I see it.

I walk up to the printer just churning away and the HR person trying to cancel a print job.  Another salary calculation page that is highly confidential. He tells me that this printer keeps printing multiple copies when he only wants one.  He leaves with a stack of paper and I almost forget about it.  That day I meet with the HR person and the CEO.  We discuss HR items and then at the end of the meeting the CEO warns the HR person about leaving confidential paper on the printer as he did it again and it could cost him his job.  HR person says he only uses the secure print feature.

Now that I see this is a serious issue I actually think about it and see the pattern.  I never used this feature so I tried it see how it behaved.  I used secure print and walked to the printer.

Button -&gt; secure print

Enter user -&gt;Funketime1

Select print job -&gt; OK

Enter action -&gt; (Colour print, B/W print, advanced) -&gt; B/W print

Number of copies -&gt; (default 1, number) -&gt; OK (which uses the default)

Enter password -&gt; XXXX

Printer prints my 1 page document once.  I think I am smart and walk back to my desk.  Remote into the printer and pull the logs. Sort by user.  30 print jobs of 183 copies by HR.  Some cancelled but many show as completed.  Max entry into number of copies was three digits.

I walk into the HR office and asked him if his password starts with 183. Yes, and he says he usually has to enter his password twice before it will start printing.  Give a printing lesson so he stops entering his password into the number of copies field.  I was thankful his password started with a 1 not a 9.  If there was a full time IT person on job it would have been sorted out earlier (or not as I was privy to some of the confidential information).

TL/DR - Clueless HR person enters password into # of pages field and ends up printing 4000 pages of shredding in first couple of weeks on the job and risks his employment.",1,1621778610
2895,For fail save you need at least two single points of failure,"sorry for the long introduction. tl;dr in the end.

Some Background: The tale takes place on an semi-academic site with some centralized IT services (ISP, Mail, the basic DNS and backbone network.)

The rest is managed by the institutes housed on the campus. You can buy in everything (Domain, server, server housing, storage, etc) from our central IT, but it is not cheap. Also, if you use their equipment, you have to play by their rules. 

We have ca. 100 users. I am resonsible for nearly everything in our institute when it comes to the infrastructure. I am basically a janitor with an engineering degree and a bit too much knowledge about IT, construction, building infrastructure and our software we use. 

However the IT should be managed by someone else. Let's call him $Uncle Dagobert. Uncle Dagobert has a healthy aversion against investing some money in our infrastructure or the IT. He is also our CFO acting. And he doesn't like the rules from the IT department.

&amp;#x200B;

Most of our work consists of field simulations of various RF components and working with AI for pattern recognition and so on (so the car can tell if it is about to hit a pedestrian, another car or a lamp post). 

The standard issue gear consists of core i5 pcs with onboard graphic cards. 

We have ca. 10 servers for heavy workloads, but because they needed to be cheap, so a server is normally something like a xeon with 8 cores@3GHz and one lonely mid grade Nvidia gaming graphics card. 

&amp;#x200B;

$Uncle Dagobert doesn't want to hear the constant whining of the users, so if there is a problem with the pcs he normally gives me the order to fix it. That way he is not bothered with the standard problems like a broken monitor or that someone wiped his hard drive when he wanted to format an usb stick. (Yes, every user has admin rights on his or her boxes, because $Uncle Dagobert also can't be bothered with installing software and he is the boss of the IT). Also the users normally come to me, because they know the reactions.

If there is a more serious problem, I give him a ticket with the issue and what needs to be done. For example if the nify new AI software doesn't want to use the graphics card on the user's box and the CPU is working to its lonely and hot death. Solution: Buy and install a compatible graphics card, because onboard intel graphics does not go well with nvidia cuda. Or buy time on one of the clusters.

The typical answer to my tickets is: ""We don't need that, because it works since 10 years that way and the users just need to simplify their work. Use the servers"" Yeah right. Because a 50€ card will help with analyzing some 100G of lidar data. 

&amp;#x200B;

All the servers are housed in a server room, which is a colocation space. It was an unused space in the basement of an other building. I had planned the structure of the room to make it a decent server closet, but most of my plans got rejected because it cost too much. In retrospect, perhaps we could have opted out on the fire supression system, because data centers don't burn, right?

But at least two independent power supply legs, redundant uplink to the backbone net, an UPS with generator backup and redundant cooling would be nice to have. 

I covered my back with some paper and moved on, because $Uncle Dagobert told me that the servers are his domain. Yes boss man. 

&amp;#x200B;

About two years later:

I come to work at 7. Enough time to do all the administrative work and start the important projects before the first users come to work at nine. I found two mails from our work shop crew that they can't access their shared network drives and the internet. Okay, perhaps just a defective network card. Will look into it later. 

Not shortly after the first call: ""The internet is down!"" 

Strange. I have access. Both users are on the same switch. And so am I. So I go to the user's PC and make some tests. DNS not found. Wait. It is not the standard DNS, but an IP from our network. Reset the DNS to the standard. Internet is working again. User is happy. 

I go back and run some tests. It looks like all of our servers have vanished. And that's a problem, because nearly everything runs through them. Licenses, printing services, the whole active directory, the users' data and for some reason since yesterday most of the DNS queries. Luckily mail is centralized, so no problem there. Also all my data is hosted at the central IT, because I like my data backed up and ready to. I really hate redoing engineering work because of data loss.

So I write a ticket for $Uncle Dagobert that there is a problem with the server room and that he needs to come in, because it is not my domain. 

Some users become unhappy because they can't work (aka surf in the net while waiting for results), so I write a mail to all that we have a problem with our servers and I can't say how long the outage will be. 

&amp;#x200B;

8 o'clock. $Uncle Dagobert ($UD) arrived. And he is not happy, because he didn't plan to come in this day. And he is sure that I made a mistake. 

$UD: ""The system had worked for years. It is fail safe, because if something failed the monitoring system would have told me.""

$me: ""The monitoring system was one of the first victims. It died with the server it was housed on. All our servers are dead. I checked it. And I want to have the day off because I could not work. The licenses for our simulation tools...""

$UD: ""But you maintain the electric systems and the network..."" 

$me: ""yes, but the problem are the servers and the server room. It is not my responsibility. Our boss told me in writing, that it is your responsibility, because you wanted it that way. Have fun."" 

&amp;#x200B;

In the end I helped him, because a failed 20kVA UPS is something you should know what you do. 

&amp;#x200B;

Well, it was was not just the UPS which committed suicide, but the failing cooling system assisted it. The outage lastet over one day.

&amp;#x200B;

$UD was mad, because his fail safe system had failed. We did a post mortem single point of failure anaysis of the setup:

\- All of our services were bundled on one flimsy server, which was virtualized into five to eight servers. (the experimental DNS, DHCP, Active Directory, License servers, printing server, the user data,...)

\- The host server's drive consisted of roughly 10 drives in one RAID. 

\- There is a backup... on a tape library which overwrites a LTO7 tape over and over. 

\- There was no mirror server, which could switch over.

\- Single uplink to one top of the rack switch

\- the Top of the Rack switch was linked to an other 10G fiber switch, which has just one 10G fiber uplink to the backbone. The original plan required a 2x12 fiber patch panel setup directly linked to the backbone net of the campus and at least redundant uplinks, but costs...

\- The AC was not a redundant precision cooling system, but just some domestic cold water radiator with fans.

\- The redundant power distribution with one UPS and one generator leg was just a cable, which ended in the dying UPS. The manual bypass was never installed, so the UPS could not safely be bypassed without cutting power. Also, the UPS was housed in the same room, because UPS like it cool, and who needs an additional AC if we could just use that one.

\- And even if we had two independend power sources, it would not have helped at all, because all our servers and the main switch had just one power supply. But hell, who coud afford 200€ for the second power supply? We are on budget. Better cut off 100 (expensive) people from their data and ability to work for one day.

\- And the kicker: Physical security of the racks was top notch. No one bothered to change the locks from the standard rittal 3524 key. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now everything is fine. The UPS got a manual bypass and the monitoring system is mirrored on an other server in an other room with all the really important services like DHCP and DNS. This time no costs were cut and a little raspberry pi blinks happily in $UD's office and tells him that the system works. 

The rest of it... well, that is all way too expensive, because we have the monitoring system. Also we eliminated two single points of failure, so the system is fail save, right?

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: Build a server system with many single points of failures, trust in a single monitoring system and wonder why the setup fails nethertheless.",1,1621763776

We handle chat-support where you are talking in real time with a customer instead of having them waiting for a couple hours to get an answer from a ""Normal"" ticket. 

The lady that I got connected with had issues to upload files to our Storage service. She mentioned that she was not-so-tech so I tried to keep a *high-level* conversation as much as possible. After the first troubleshooting steps didn't work I offered a video-call and we jumped in. She was very polite and had this nice puppy picture as profile photo, a very charming woman.

I asked her to share her screen with me and it turns out that she gave the permissions to the wrong account. We went through the documentation together: I read the steps (using that non-tech language), she performed them and I double-checked the actions with our internal tools. We had to repeat some steps because she forgot to click on *Save* but she was cooperative and very willing to learn.

2902,Where's my website?,"I landed a Help Desk role at a Web Hosting / Domain Name Provider in 2002.  This company sold top-level domain names (Like a GoDaddy), and did webhosting, but did not do web development.

This was a small family-run Mom &amp; Pop business.  Less than 20 employees in the whole company.  We had 1 overnight guy, but he didn't do helpdesk.  All after-hour calls went to voicemail and we would follow up in the morning.

First day on the job, I get a call from an elderly gentleman who just bought a domain name and wanted to know where his website was.   Thinking on my feet and trying to think of something he could relate to, I equated buying domain names and web hosting akin to buying property.

I told the gentleman that buying a domain name is like buying an empty lot.  And Web hosting is akin to running your utilities (Water, Sewer, Power, etc.).  I then told him web development is where you design and build the house.  Either you can do it yourself, or a hire a web development company (Like you would a building contractor). 

I continued to use that analogy while working there.",1,1621628443
2903,Things Change After a Buyout...,"This is a follow-up from ‘Taking Over for Bad IT’. 

After working 8 great years with a medical manufacturing company the news came in...we just got bought by Big Medical Company (BMC). Oh happy day! My stock options were worth money now! It will look great on the resume to work for BMC. The future looks bright! Or so I thought. 

Day 1: We all celebrate! Lunch is brought in and we do karaoke! (Yes, I sang Billy Joel’s Piano Man). Such great fun! 

Day 2: BMC has individual meeting scheduled. We are to bring our updated resume in order for them to consider reassignment...or so we were told, instead it was a ‘end of employment’ meeting complete with documents showing us how to apply for unemployment and how to train for a new job. 

Our celebration quickly turned to sadness as we found out the manufacturing part of our product was heading to a facility in Juarez Mexico. There would be no need for most other office jobs, HR, Accounting, Upper Management, etc. I believe the only people they wanted to keep were our sales/consultants. 

When it came to IT, they have a standard policy to have NO internal IT employees. All IT functions are hired out to third party consultants. That hit me pretty hard. I went home dejected and not ready to find another job. I did determine to give the last two weeks the best I had to offer. 

Day 5: I’m called into one of the conference rooms with one of the BMC reps. 

Rep: Hey bambam67, how are you holding up? 

Me: Too be honest I’m still in shock. We all worked so hard and I know getting bought was the goal, but how it all went down was a real disappointment. 

Rep: Are you mad or upset? You can be honest.

Me: I’m mostly sad. I worked really hard to make this place run like clockwork and now I have a week left before I have to go find some other job. 

Rep: What if I asked you to stay on longer? Would you consider it? We need someone to take care of the sales people and the servers you have on site. 

Me: I’d have to think about it. 

Rep: Well, think about an extension of employment for another month. We’ll meet again Monday. 

Well, what would you do? I’m at a point in my career that I’d never been paid higher, I know the servers inside and out and my users are quickly going to be cut (but my pay wouldn’t)...I would be in charge of the sales people who are all remote. So I stayed. 1 month was extended to 3, 3 to 6 and 6 to 1 full year. 

It was bitter sweet overall...I’d spend an entire week of every month getting the SOX (Sarbanes Oxley) reports done, send out usb dongles to our sales people (who would constantly lose or break them), and I would help our lone accounting person get things packed up and shipped out of the office. It was good work until it just became me and him only in the office during our last month. When I had to pack up my servers I admit I shed a tear or two. We closed the doors to the office and I separated myself from BMC.

A month later I get a call from the IT temp agency. They want me to help this other medical company because they just got bought by, yep, you know who, BMC. The pay was good and they needed help swapping out their computers to the BMC computers and I new all the ins and outs. 

I took the job and met the 3 guys doing IT. They were all very nice and all positive about their future with BMC. I couldn’t tell them wait awaited them day 1. They didn’t know me or trust me...after working with them for 2 weeks and working long days replacing desktop after desktop I was accepted into their group. I knew I was accepted when I was invited to attend a meeting with them and the VP of IT from BMC. VP was someone I had heard of and saw his name but we never met or spoke. 

We go to the meeting and VP basically tells us that the deployment of desktops needs to move faster and that an outside IT person was coming in to “help.” My new IT team looked at each other a bit confused but if they needed to go faster okay. And then, as the stars aligned, as we left the meeting I take it upon myself to introduce myself to VP of IT...the quick conversation went line this:

Me: Excuse me VP, I was the IT Manager at (put my old company name here). We never got to meet each other and I just appreciate the extra time you gave me so we could shut the office down. 

VP: (rudely) Oh, you’re the one. 

He sees my outstretched hand to shake (believe it or not, in the ‘before time’ people actually shook hands as a sign of acknowledgement and respect) and just walks away. I could hear him mumbling: 

VP: (talking to his other BMC ppl) ...that guy cost us a lot of our IT budget...

I stood shocked at how incredibly rude a person could be. My blood started to boil. My new IT members (again I was just a temp) saw the entire interaction and were surprised. We all went back to our IT area and had a quick conversation. 

IT Guys: bambam67, what was that with VP? 

Me: Unfortunately, that is what you can expect from BMC. 

IT Guys: What do you mean?

Me: Okay, I’ve only been here a couple weeks, you know I worked with BMC before after being bought out. Can I tell you what’s really happening right now? 

IT Guys: What do you think is happening? I’m happy to do this job for BMC. 

Me: You mean taking out every Dell computer that you deployed and switching them with a special BMC IBM? 

IT Guys: Yeah, sure, it’s for security and standardization.

Me: It’s for them to take control of your network and your systems so they can remote in to support. 

IT Guys: But someone has to support the users on site, right? 

Me: Yes, someone does. Who do you think is coming in to ‘help’ with deployment? I believe the VP said he was a certified IBM Support Specialist. 

IT Guys: So? 

Me: Are any of you IBM certified? 

IT Guys: No. 

Me: That guy coming in is going to replace you all, I have no doubt about it. And after working with you guys I couldn’t stay silent any longer. Update your resume and start looking for a new job now. As soon as the computers are swapped out, they won’t need you anymore. You are just overhead. A number on a report. You all saw how VP treated me after the meeting. I shouldn’t have to say much more. 

We all found new jobs within a month by helping each other by reformatting our resumes, giving each other contact info, references, advice and more. The IBM support guy did take over all desktop support for the company. He would come in while I still worked my contract. All tickets that weren’t emergencies were pointed to him. I was not allowed to help, just allowed to answer the phone. I would field calls asking when support was coming and all I could do is tell them to wait. Sometimes IBM support guy would come in late 9-10am if he came in at all. He would take an hour lunch and then leave by 2pm. After I left I kept in touch with people on the inside and was told he would take days to support the most simplest requests. 

When users are viewed as just ‘users’ and not people, that’s a big step towards bad IT support. When IT is viewed as just overhead, that plants the seed for creating bitter IT personnel, poor support, etc. BMC probably saves a ton of money by hiring 3rd party support, but they probably lose just as much in productivity from workers who have to wait or receive subpar support. Okay, I’m stepping down from my soapbox.

2906,It's happening again - only your device isn't working!,"I work as a service engineer in the medical field - I do technical things with medical things. 

I got a job where the site was having connectivity issues on a system. 

Occasionally the system would hang, requiring a reboot which would remedy the issue, or pressing certain keys to refresh the connection. 

The site advised it was getting worse. Please fix. 

Basically it's a PC that connects to some equipment with a data cable in the next room, which is an operating theatre. We drop a spare just in case the initial one dies. After that, were running more cables through conduits in the ceiling or under the floor. 

I go to site, chuck some theatre scrubs on a d go to the room with the PC, boot the PC and head into the theatre to check the connection to the unit. 

Other than the original data cable looking a little battered, but OK (they're pretty tough) everything checks out. I bend the cable while testing to make sure there's no intermittent issue - nope. Run all my checks etc - all G. I check logs to see if there's some issue before these issues - nothing looks weird to me, but I send a copy to the god-level techs, and await a reply. Might take a while, maybe they'll see something I don't. 

I advised the site to use the backup cable and see if the problem still happens - it's never been used... It's still coiled up from the initial install a few months ago. I coil up the old cable and connect the spare. 

Fast forward a few weeks and I get a call advising it's *still* happening. Just less intermittent, but still annoying. Please fix. 

I think - Maybe I'll need to reload software, replace connectors, etc. I make sure I have what I need for my next visit. 

My next visit happens to be when the site is using the unit in the morning and I asked to sit in to see if the issue comes up. OK, no worries... Lucky for me, a clinical specialist for the unit is also there.

I get some scrubs on and sit in the room with the PC, not in the theatre. All the equipment is setup, multiple nurses, surgeon, patient on the table. About to start. Equipment testing is done, all good.
I look at my unit in the theatre, all good, connected correctly plenty of slack.  


Then I see it. Not sure how anyone missed it. 


A nurse moves my unit to the side to stand next to the surgeon. 

The data cable that goes into the unit in the theatre is connected, but it now it goes from the hole in the floor to the unit, and it's really taut, and straining to be connected... And the connection to the unit is definitely iffy at best. There's no slack in the cable, and we give 3-5 metres so they can setup easily. 

They've just got a really weird setup of all the equipment, with my unit off to the side so that the cables almost don't reach at all. 

Surgeon asks nurse to connect a medical instrument to my unit, and this will need to be verified by the staff in the room I'm in that it's connected before they start. 

Instrument is connected, no verification. Medical procedure can't proceed. They try another instrument - same. 

Medical staff are checking connections, resetting software, surgeon is annoyed. 

I ask the clinical specialist that is in the room with me if this setup is usual for the procedure - yes.

I ask if we can move my unit a little closer so that cable isn't straining so much.  Clinical specialist says sure, walks in, moves the unit so the data cable has slack. I ask to have that cable reseated, and the connection reset - clinical specialist says that's ok.  It's also done. 

I need to ask because I'm a technical employee, and this is during a real medical procedure.  I will not change anything without clinical personnel on my side giving the OK. 

Instrument is checked again for verification - ok.  Procedure can go ahead, surgeon is less annoyed. 

Nurse next to surgeon is a little annoyed that they have less space to work with. 

Procedure goes off without any issues. 

Clinical specialist and I check first instrument after the procedure is done to make sure it was good. It was also good. 

I advised of the issue, and recommended personnel watch that cable. If it's not long enough, we can run another set of cables if need be. Or maybe just have the nurse stand on the other side of the surgeon. 

No issues since. Thank goodness.",1,1621596930

2910,How do people not notice/clue in?,"I've spent the last couple of years doing tech support for a mid-sized company and I've always had little faith in people, but these past couple years have really opened my eyes to how oblivious and clueless people are. I truly don't understand how these people manage to survive..

Laptops these days tend to come with a physical cover for the built in webcam. I first noticed it within a minute of opening the laptop to set it up for users, it's not that hard to spot or figure out that it's there. Or at least, so I thought. There's been at least 4 tickets submitted over the past month due to ""Teams video only shows black"". 

Most of the users clue in almost immediately, but one however wasn't convinced when I said there was a physical cover. This user submitted a second ticket, cc'ing their manager, asking for further clarification because they had thought I meant ""webcams are disabled entirely"" when what I really said was ""There's a physical cover on the webcam"".

My first interaction with the user was via a call for an unrelated ticket and they casually brought it up so I casually answered so I had assumed that the user submitted a second ticket because they just misheard me so I responded to the ticket reiterating that the webcam does indeed have a physical cover and it just needs to be switched on/off.

The follow-up response I got from the user proved that they in fact, did not mishear me. Thankfully they sent a picture of their built in webcam showing me that there clearly was no cover for the camera. They also helpfully included a video of the video that the webcam records (30 seconds of black).

After staring at my screen in disbelief for a few minutes, I edited the pic to include an arrow pointing to the switch, attached it to the response with the message ""See attached.""

Their response? ""I told you I wasn't a techie!"". No, sir, you're a blind moron. Technology has nothing to do with this.

**tl;dr: Why can't anyone see me on webcam?**

We are in a bit of a license crunch (company hired a lot this year but didn't take that into consideration when we signed the new contract so we're trying to use the exact same nunnery of licences even though there are an additional 300 users this year). So anyone who has not logged in for 90 days gets automatically deactivated by a nightly work flow. When reactivating a user who lapsed for this reason, they HAVE TO login that day, or they get deactivated that night by the work flow. So when I reactivate, I always send a user explaining that they must login today, I explain why, and what will happen if they don't. The user I set up yesterday didn't follow these instructions and was upset when they were disabled today. So my first email of the day was 'you just set me up yesterday, what gives'. My reply was basically....did you not receive my email yesterday? And I included the same message. User responds with 'oh, I did get that but I didn't read it'

2913,Email migration Phases 2-6 and the unsurprising discovery that the lower the technical level of the user...,"[So my rant from a few weeks ago was received with open arms](https://old.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/n1j6yx/why_bother_with_advance_notice_if_nobody_reads_it/) (thank you all for the validation)

I decided as today is the final phase of migration to post a quick followup.

To quickly recap, I'm currently a sysadmin for a 1200+ employee manufacturing facility that is owned by a German conglomerate.  We are being forced to migrate from a WAY out dated on-prem Exchange 2010 environment to another on-prem environment controlled by a vendor located in Germany.

Preplanning within the department and executive management determined that we should separate the migration into multiple phases starting with who was assumed to be the most technically inclined (office workers, engineers, etc) and end with the manufacturing floor employees with the least amount of assumed technical expertise as their job was not focused on working on a computer.

In a completely unsurprising revelation, each phase resulted in less and less requests for assistance from the support desk.

Part of this was definitely a real time lessons learned in communications, but I and my coworkers all agree that the real reason is that the less technical employees were used to following step by step work instructions (none of which needed to be updated between phases) and as a result experienced a smoother migration.

2914,The hard way to connect a second monitor,"I'm a student working IT over the summer at a small medical practice. While I'm away, IT support is provided by a contractor. When I come back every year, everybody is always glad to see me. This is also when the most peculiar and interesting issues often present themselves, because the users like me more than they like the contractor, so they wait for my return.

A user wanted a second monitor on her desktop PC. She managed to find one of the many Dell E2009W units laying around, and also grabbed a VGA cable from the cable bin. The problem is that her machine is a HP Compaq 8200 -- a business grade PC, about 7-8 years old, with integrated video. It has one VGA port on the back, and no other obvious way to get video out of it. So, she called the contractor.

The contractor came out and spent 45 minutes trying various ways to get the second monitor to plug in the computer, but nothing they did worked. The user accepted that she may only ever have one monitor, but asked me to take a look when I came back.

I looked at the back of the computer and found that it had a DisplayPort in addition to the VGA port. But the DisplayPort was strangely unoccupied. I wondered what the contractor tried. I went to the monitor and found a cable in the VGA port, so I traced it back to the PC and found that it was... a USB to VGA cable.

I avoid USB graphics devices at all costs, because they don't have enough power to run anything more than a PowerPoint with no transitions. So, I unplugged this stupid cable from the back of the machine, and found why it didn't work -- it was a USB 3.0 cable, in a USB 2.0 port. (The computer didn't have any USB 3 ports, and USB 2 won't cut it for graphics output.)

I went back to a newly-arrived box of parts from another department, found a DisplayPort to VGA adapter, and set up the second monitor. The user has spent the rest of the day raving about how helpful I am to all our coworkers. It's the little things that count.",1,1621537672
2915,"Customer fried my laptop, and I underclock his so I won't have to diagnose or fix real issue.","I provide IT services to individuals and companies local to me, and my company also does component level repair, appliance repair, networking, motherboard repair, etc. Basically all-inclusive tech servicing. It's 80% knowing how to google and surf forums.

This is kind of a long saga, and this customer did 2 things worth posting. But since it was the same customer, I am going to put them together.

A customer came in with a hard drive, and said he wanted to copy the files off of it.

Customer: It didn't work, it just doesn't work on any of my computers.

Me: Ok, let's take a look. Let me plug this into my...

Poof! Magic smoke from my enter key

Me: I think this drive just killed my laptop.

Customer: Oh yeah, it killed my laptops too. Both of them, so I think it's the drive.

Me:...

Customer: Do you think you can get the files off of it?

Me, a little bit in shock as this is my main workhorse:...I am really glad that this is under warranty... Is my drive OK?...

To be completely honest, I don't remember how it went like this. But I am a wuss ball-less pushover and I never confront anyone. I remember telling him it's fine, while I was raging inside... I'll do my best.

Me: I think this is under warranty, so I should be able to replace it for free.

Customer: Oh OK. So, you can't get the files off?

Me: No, I can't. I am not going to try, to be honest.

Customer: That's OK, I don't really need anything on it but I was hoping I would not have to buy a new one.

WHAT THE GODDARN HECK IT'S A 200GB EXTERNAL DRIVE, YOU CAN GET A 256 USB SSD FOR LIKE $30 GOD DARN SON!

Me: Ok, well if you want a drive like this, Samsung makes some good flash drives that are durable and will preform better than this for about $40.

Customer: Oh, no it's alright. Well I guess the only thing now is to fix my laptop. I want to fix this one if possible.

Me: Oh, what happened?

Customer: I plugged that drive into it and it instantly turned off and won't turn on again.

GODDARNIT YOU STUPID JACK HORSE YOU DIDN'T THINK TO TELL ME THAT IT LITERALLY FRIED YOUR LAPPY BEFORE ASKING ME TO SEE WHAT'S ON IT!?

Me, smiling under stress: Oh, well the motherboard is probably dead. If you plugged it into the left side maybe I can disconnect the daughter board and...

Customer: It was the right side.

Me: Oh, that's not good. Let me see what I can do, can you wait a few minutes please?

I took apart the laptop, and I could not see any damage. No burn marks, no magic smoke, no shorts/heating, and I could not fine any schematics online. Damnit. I would have to charge $400 just because it will take me hours to figure out what failed. So I look up the cost of the board online, and they're only $300 used on E-bay! Which one should I do? Maybe the customer will pay more if it's done today? Eh, I don't feel like working that hard today, and I am kinda tired, so I tell the customer that I can't fix it and that I found a replacement motherboard online.

Me: Hello, I won't be able to fix this motherboard, but I can replace the motherboard for $50, if you can find a replacement. I found one on eBay for $300, in ""refurbished"" condition (Repair shop word for a guy like myself took the mobo out of a booting laptop with a ripped off screen and a cracked chassis and cleaned it).

Customer: OK, I can do that. So, it will be $350? Do you think it needs anything else?

Me: If you think it's too slow I would first install an SSD, but if you are satisfied I think i would not worry.

Customer: OK, I think I just want to reset it.

Me: OK, I can re-install Windows 10 after. It's another $35.

Customer: So, $385?

Me: Yes, that's right. Can I please get your number so I can create this quote?

After the customer left, I did 2 things. The first was to order the motherboard on eBay, and the second was to contact Acer Support Chat and tell them ""My laptop has a black screen, but it sounds like it's turning on"" (Playing dumb works). I shipped it out, they swapped the motherboard and sent it back... but left the old paste on the spreader which made my fans run hot but I fixed that up.

The motherboard arrived, and spent about 20 minutes disassembling his lappy, and reassembling with the new motherboard.

It boots up fine, so I then used the Windows 10 factory reset which went fine, and the laptop ran fine after.

Customer picks up the laptop and 4 days later, complains it crashes sometimes when he processes his video (Sony vegas).

He brings laptop to me... I run a memory test, nothing. I run a stress test, nothing. I open Sony Vegas, and opened the last project from recent menu. I hit render... Gets to 40% fine, and I walk away. I come back, and Vegas has hanged at about 84%, not responsive, but his Video preview had some colored horizontal lines... exactly what happens when a bitmap image gets corrupted in ram or flash... So I tested the ram again... worked fine... the fuck?

I then ran IntelBurnTest and managed to get it to just... crash. Not bluescreen, but wonky stuff. Crashing programs and services, buggy performance, just... weird. Goddamnit, maybe the CPU is bad.

I was frustrated, mad at the customer, and I did not want to deal with it anymore. I went into the BIOS settings, and changed the lappy fan from ""Active"" to ""Passive"" which means the fan will run at low speed more, and the CPU will slightly underclock instead of the fan spinning up first. I then went into Windows power profiles, and set the max CPU frequency to 99%. This means instead of the 2.39ghz CPU boosting up to 3.2Ghz sometimes when under fewer threads, it is pegged to it's max base clock. However, the computer ran much cooler and quieter. I noticed that Vegas was hitting all CPU... but not the Nvidia GPU. So, I switched Vegas to use the GPU for rendering, and when I rendered it again, not only did it do it in 1/3 of the time, it did so without ramping up the fans.

Me: Hello, I tweaked some processor power and speed parameters and made Sony Vegas use the GPU. This will free up the CPU, and run cooler. It's stable, and it works now. It passed 2 renders fine now.""

I did NOT tell him that I limited the performance of his laptop to prevent me from needing to figure out the real issue, or send back the refurb motherboard.

Customer: OK Great.

4 days later, I get a text from the customer.

Customer Text: ""Hey, the laptop runs even faster now, is quieter, and it loaded my video really quick! Thank you!""

Little does he know.... hehehehehe

TL;DR Customer's HDD fried his lappy and mine. Acer Warrenty fixed mine, and I fixed his. His new motherboard was unstable under load, I underclocked it and it was stable, so I did NOT tell the customer what I really did (I didn't lie either) and his experience was better when I told his program to use his fancy Nvidia GPU for rendering instead of the default integrated graphics, making his experience better overall... making me feel OK not telling him.",1,1621536127
2916,The day I learnt about Floppy Disks,"I just remembered a story I meant to post here a while back but forgot to.

A few months back, I was working on commissioning a Laser Characterization system, and as such needed to take a bunch of really accurate measurements of the waveform response as we added each new section of cables from the wave generator to the testbench. For this, I was using a very high accuracy, but very old oscilloscope that was originally from the 80's, so a real hardware driven machine that was 5x the size of most current models. But it was also the highest fidelity unit on site, so had to be used.

The key issue with using this scope, was in order to save the waveforms and transport them to a PC to analyse, they had to be saved to a floppy disk. This in itself caused some issues as we hadn't used floppys in quite a few years so tracking one down took a while. Eventually a 1.44MB drive was found as well as a USB floppy reader. So I run the tests and save the waveforms to the floppy, then take the floppy and plug it into the PC via the USB reader and import the files to my PC to analyse. So far so good.

The real issue came then next day when I tried to boot the PC and nothing would happen. No windows boot screen, nothing coming up.... So after playing around in the bios to see if anything obvious was popping up and some googling and finding nothing, I called a colleague who actually works in the IT dept. He comes over and tries a few tricks but gets nowhere. So eventually he decides to take my workstation and disconnect it and bring it back to his own desk to try booting it there....and it starts right up immediately!

So bring it back over to my desk and plug my peripherals back in, power the system on and now its working again, how strange.

And that ladies and gents is when I happened to look down and see one of the items I had unplugged in order to hand over the PC to my colleague.....the floppy drive in the reader....And that's when I learnt that windows still has floppy drives at the top of the boot order in windows and I had been trying for hours to boot windows from a 1.44MB floppy containing a few images.

In the end it took a few weeks to live that one down...

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR windows boot order still prioritizes floppy drives first",1,1621525112
2917,Damaging Government Equipment,"I got my first real IT job awhile back in 2013. It was a general support desk, brand new position that they really hadn't figured out yet. Anywhere from doing server backups to following up on maintenance requests to managing accounts. I had to keep track of like six different passwords for each network I was on but it was fun, and I felt important since I was the only one in the role at the time.

&amp;#x200B;

I got a call from a lady we'll call Jessica. Jessica was a longtime employee located on the same site, just in a different area. Her computer wouldn't boot up and she complained that I needed to come fix it ASAP as she was trying to work on an important project. No problem, I was used to people being annoyed and thinking that if they yelled or complained at IT things would get done faster. I walked out to her desk which was about 10 minutes away from our office. Grabbed the computer while she huffed and puffed and kept getting no boot device found. I also heard a faint clicking when I turned on the computer.

&amp;#x200B;

Pulled it out from under her desk and could tell the HDD was damaged. It happens just not very often, but I don't have spare HDD's so I'd have to get her a new computer while I ordered one. I apologized and explained the issue, which only made her angrier. Shrugged it off and took the computer back to our office to fill out the paperwork. Brought her a spare computer after I imaged it and plugged it up. Luckily all of her data was backed up to her shared drive. Later I noticed that the casing had a small dent in it, but the area was under funded and sometimes we used recycled cases.

&amp;#x200B;

A few weeks later I come back around to her area and am doing an inventory check on everything when I hear an odd noise. I poke my head into her cubical and she's sitting there, idly kicking the computer with her leg crossed. I instantly realize this is where the dent in the last computer came from. I ask her what she was doing kicking the computer and she said it was in her way and she always does this and to mind my own business. Grab her supervisor who ended up punishing her for damaging government equipment. Needless to say I never saw her again.",1,1621519838

2919,Well there's your problem!,"I was working as a minion in a big law firm, when I met yoooouuu,... no, wait. I was working for a law firm back in the very early 2000s, and it was based in a typical old, London office. It was a series of old houses or small businesses that had been knocked through and some external entrances bricked up to form one ""building"". Way too many staircases for an office, and doors leading through to other rooms at weird places and a different levels. The power and networking management was a mess. The whole firm and all the departments to support the ""real"" employees who dids all the legals and paid for all us hanger-ons were in this building.

The server room was a small room in the basement of the building, next to the Reprographics room. It was small, about 10ft square, yet still on two levels, and had a PC there for accessing anything you couldn't do on a server, plus about 10 racks of servers. This was early 2000s, so a normal rack server took up about 4U. Add a KVM and a UPS and you only got 2 or 3 in a rack. And they were loud.

Around lunch-time one day several services stop responding. People outside IT panic at big issues, but if you've worked there any while you learn that the big ones give you way more clues and a generally easier to solve. This was pretty much everything, so you start narrowing it down pretty quickly. 

Server died? Too many services are affected. The chances of that many servers dying at the same time is too low, and from knowledge of the server room some already knew they weren't even positioned close to each other.
Power? We're in the same building and we're OK, unlikely. Also, it's not everything, so not that.
Network? Well, everything in that server room probably only uses 1 or 2 switches to communicate with the rest of the building. Maybe they use the same power-strip and that died? Or someone uploaded a bad config to both of them, but no-one is down there right now.

The lead guy in Networking headed down there. He wasn't the Networking Manager, but he was the highest up person who deserved a salary, so best person for the job. On entering the room the problem was quickly apparent; someone had stolen the hot-swap hard drives from 3 servers. They stole all of the drives from the documents, email and HR server drives. The documents and email servers had 36Gb drives, and the HR server had 18Gb drives. At the time 36Gb server drives were expensive and we didn't have anything bigger in that server room. You could think they just grabbed the highest capacity for the highest value. Except that in the server rack right next to next to the document server was the accounts server which had 36Gb, albeit fewer of them.

This was clearly not a random theft, and what a gutsy one to do it in the middle of the working day. I never heard any fallout from it though. You had to think someone was after something in particular, but there was never an incident you could point to and say ""And you know how they know that, dontcha?""",1,1621508780

**$Me:** Me
**$SA:** SaaS Application
**$AC:** Angry Client

It's important to note that this particular $SA required a VPN to work and $AC used an old unsupported VPN firewall made by Netgear. Netgear support officially ended in 2017 and firmware updates appeared to stop 1-2 years before.

If you have ever supported a Netgear firewall, you know there are bugs which can only be ""resolved"" by tweaking your settings or routinely rebooting the firewall. The recommended upgrade would have cost $400 USD parts and labor. Instead, $AC simply calls in routinely with similar shenanigans....

Anytime I speak to $AC, I get this attitude like I've wronged this person. Much like I'm being found guilty until proven innocent. I wonder is this just their default tone... I remind myself that maybe they are just having a bad day...again... so I try to kill them with kindness.

**$Me:** Support, this is $Me, how can I help you?

**$Me:** Checks server and it's not down, checks VPN logs and I see we received corrupt packets from $AC's Netgear on the phase 2 negotiation. Bingo!

I'm no genius, but I can deduce that A) we don't get this error from the hundreds of other VPN's which are live and B) some googling points to KB's from our VPN appliance vendor noting an issue with the remote VPN device or ISP between.

Therefore, the issue is most likely a temp one with the clients VPN device or ISP since I don't see it occuring before in the logs. It's also important to note that there has been really bad weather near $AC this particular day.

I also see the Phase 2 finally received a good packet and completed successfully. Yay!

He said we shouldn’t “share” them (no OneDrive or MailDrop), we should instead attach them directly to the email. The PowerPoint files sometimes got too big to send through email. There was a minimum number of slides required, (this time it was around 75) and we had to put a picture on each slide. Naturally, they got big, unless you had really low resolution pictures. My file usually is around 100 MB, and the school’s email server has a hard limit at 33 MB. Some people who try to send their file, especially with those who have Macs (which use MailDrop), send a link when it gets too big. (Some people found that a PDF was smaller, and he accepted PDFs too)

So, I asked him why he won’t accept links. This is basically how the conversation went:
(T: Teacher)

Me: Why can’t we send links?
T: it closes my grade book
(I should add that the grade book is web based)
Me: it shouldn’t close it.
T: When I click on the link, my grade book disappears and I have to reopen it every time, which takes like five minutes every time, and I have a hundred other projects to grade.
Me: You know that Chrome opens a new tab, right?
T: No it doesn’t
Me: let me show you.... open a link
T: *opens the link* Now if I go to my grade book... *clicks on Chrome on the task bar, which minimizes the window* ... everything goes away!

I proceed to show him how tabs work and that you can just click the tab on the top that says ""Gradebook"" and then the grade book will appear, and then click on ""Document1.pptx"" to go back to the PowerPoint.

I guess he accepts links now.

tl;dr: My teacher doesn’t know how Chrome tabs work",1,1621486100

Now, as some back ground, I did some clean up on this machine a few weeks back and set up Google Chrome with the bookmarks across the top bar. All has been well but now he was asking if he should get rid of his machine as the bookmarks have disappeared again and he got the computer as a hand me down from his daughter.

I tell him, I'll call in and have a look. After going out there and initially screwing up by going to the wrong house, I get a look at his machine. He must have hit the restore icon instead of the close icon at some stage as the Chrome window wasn't filling the screen and he couldn't see the bookmarks. Showed him how to Maximise and all was well although he was embarrassed about it. I got to point out I just tried to visit him on the wrong street and suspected he gave me the wrong address. He wanted to pay me for my 2 minutes of work. Said no to that as I was in the area. A good way to start the day with a happy customer.

2930,Searching for Outlook,"I'm not officially tech support, but as a new hire trainer, I've been front line tech support for my trainees since we went remote for COVID. 

It's the 2nd day of class, being conducted through videoconference. I've sent notes to everyone's email address so they can follow along and annotate though training. I instruct the class to ""Please open up Outlook on your laptop""

As usual, a few people speak up, ""How do you do that?""

""There should be an Outlook icon on your desktop, or you can search for outlook in the start menu.""

Most users find their email and open it up. One user persists ""There's nothing on the desktop and when I try to search for outlook it's just blank.""

After carefully describing the outlook icon, the user confirms they don't see it on the desktop. I'm thinking someone's laptop wasn't set up correctly. No problem, we can handle that. ""Ok, please open a browser and go to Outlook.com""

""When I type in Outlook.com it won't go.""

""Which web browser are you using?""

User stares blankly...

After about 5 minutes, I manage to teach this user how to share their screen in our software. On her shared screen, Outlook is open, and she has typed into the search bar ""Outlook"" about 15 times. 

I take control of her screen, click the X on her search results, and bam, the email we're looking for is at the top of her inbox. 

Unbeknownst to me, the users hiring manager had joined to training and witnessed the whole affair. I think she agrees we need more technical questions in the interview.

2933,"Taking Over for Bad IT (yes, another one)","Hello Boys and Girls, Uncle Bambam67 here to tell you another tale of the aftermath of bad IT support. I know most of the stories posted here are about users, but we have to recognize some of the bad apples in IT as well. I’ve been fortunate (or unfortunate) to take over for a few bad IT folks. 

This is around the early 2000’s. I had been doing contract IT work for about 3 months and not liking it. I posted my resume on Craigslist (yes, I’ve received many calls and jobs from posting on CL back in the day) and the next day I get a call. 

A medical manufacturing company 1.5hr drive away needed an IT Manager/Desktop Support all in one. I’m hesitant because of the commute but agree to meet with a promise of a free lunch. 

I meet with the CFO and have this conversation: 

CFO: So, what do think. Will you give us a chance? 

Me: It is a bit of a drive. 

CFO: I’ll make it worth your while. As a start up company I have the power to offer you stock options and a bonus. Not to mention our benefits package and 401(k).

Me: Let me go home and talk to my wife about this. 

Now, you may know already, but getting stock options are great to get on top of your salary. This company later sold and I’m still reaping the benefits. So as you can guess I said yes and I start my daily 3 hr commute. It wasn’t until my first day that I realized something was horribly wrong with the former ‘IT guy’.

Let me set the scene. HR (who was great at this company) shows me the office and I notice every cubicle is full. She takes me to the server room that had probably the loudest cooling fans I’d ever heard. Just inside the server room is a desk. 

HR: For right now, this will be your desk. I’m hoping to get some more cubes built for more new hires and yourself. 

Me: I appreciate that. I’ll be hearing the fans in my sleep. (and I did)

HR: Okay, I’ll leave you to it. 

HR leaves and I settle into my desk, check out the servers I have and start taking inventory. Then a strange occurrence...I see part of someone’s head poke through the door. 

Me: Hello? Can I help you? 

User: I am sooo sorry. I can come back later if your busy. 

They cringe in the doorway while apologizing.

Me: No no. I’m bambam67, how can I help you?

User: Well (hesitantly), my Outlook is having trouble. You can look at it anytime you want. I don’t mean to bother you. 

I kid you not. User looked like a scared little kitten. As if they we’re waiting for me to lash out. Instead...

Me: Let’s go take a look at it right now. 

User: Are you sure? 

Me: I’m pretty sure that’s why they hired me. Let’s go. 

As I helped the User they told me a strange tale of the former bad IT guy. Bad IT (BIT) was sent by a 3rd party IT agency that helped monitor their IT systems. BIT came 2-3 times a week to help with all types of issues. He seemed very competent and he was offered a job of IT Manager. He quickly became an IT Tyrant! He despised helping users and became combative with the engineering group. I was told stories of shouting matches on the main floor between BIT and Senior Engineer (SE). 

Me: Who is the SE? 

User: He sits in the cube in front of the rest of his group. He can be a little...grumpy. 

I was done fixing User’s issue and I make a beeline to SE. I stand calmly outside his cube. 

Me: Excuse me, sorry to interrupt, but are you SE? 

SE: Yes, I am. 

Me: I’m bambam67, the new IT guy. 

SE: Oh... (his mood went from stale to crusty)

Me: Look, I heard you had an issue with the last IT guy. Let me assure you, I’m here to help you. Whatever you need let me know. 

SE: Alright, thanks...wait, I need a new mouse. 

Me: Standard or Ergonomic? 

SE: Ergonomic, if possible, my wrist...

Me: Got it, let me talk to HR about our purchasing procedure and I’ll get right on it. 

SE: Okay (seemingly surprised), thanks. 

HR and I took a shopping trip at lunch. We had a Fry’s Electronic in our office complex (Western Theme). Before SE came back from lunch that same day his new mouse was setup and ready to go. 

A couple weeks pass and I’m still getting users hesitant to ask for help until this happened...I received an email from SE that he’s leaving office for a while and asks if I could update his graphics driver. He leaves and I walk up to his desk. It was like being a stranger in a old west movie, the townsfolk all starring at me as I walk down Main Street (engineering cubicle row) and go about my job. 

Engineer: Does SE know your on his machine? 

Me: Yes sir. I’m helping him out with an update. 

Eng: Really? SE asked you? 

Me: Yep. 

I continue downloading the update and then finally installing it, it took longer then expected. As I’m wrapping up with a reboot SE walks back in and makes a beeline for me in his cube. I’m in his chair as he’s peering over the side of his cube. 

SE: How’d it go? 

Me: Slower than I thought but it installed okay, hopefully that makes a difference with Solidworks. 

SE: Thank you so much bambam67. (Loudly so all his fellow engineers couldn’t help but hear) 

I walked away feeling like I broke the IT curse. I was busier then ever working on every computer in the building. No one was ever turned away or yelled at. It was one of the best companies I’ve worked for from the leadership on down...8 years later we were bought by the evil empire Johnson &amp; Johnson and that, my fellow IT friends is a whole different story.",1,1621444670

2935,What do you mean they changed the font?,"I mentioned this in a comment and decided to share my pain since law firms and printing have come up here lately.

I worked in IT for a big law firm in the early 1990s. We ran WordPerfect 5.1 on Vax/VMS. Email was only internal, so paper was everything. I had some solid skills at writing WordPerfect macros, let me tell ya.

We had nearly 100 printers all over the place. HP LaserJet II and III, with a couple high speed ones, too.

I spent my days changing toner and looking at Reveal Codes, pretty much. And clearing the print queue when users thought sending the document 5 times would help.

Then the LJ 4 came out. Not IV, but 4. Smart move on HP's part. The problem? The Courier font was slightly different. Same point size, sure, but the letters were thinner, I think.

If you printed a 3 page document on one printer and then reprinted page 3 on the new printer, you could see the difference.

The HP salesman was confused that we weren't happy with this wonderful new machine and couldn't believe anyone could see the difference in fonts, let alone CARE about it.

Back then in the dark ages, the way to get another font was to buy a cartridge that went in the printer. I eventually found one that had some newfangled fancy font AND the basic Courier one.

I don't know if they continued to buy cartridges for new printers as they got them. I left before any of the older ones died!

TL;DR: Change is bad, printer change is not to be tolerated.",1,1621441651
2936,Older Gentleman Can't Find His Mouse Cursor.,"I've never worked in IT, but I've done some light programming, controls and was on the on-call rotation for a major HVAC company about 15 years ago.


We had a customer who was in charge of maintenance for a shopping mall about 3.5 miles away who was in his mid 70s. He was very computer illiterate, and was prone to being very grumpy when our control system ""wasn't working"".


I get a call one night at 11pm or so and he's cursing up a storm because ""our system"" had deleted his mouse cursor.


I asked him to slowly make circles with the mouse, expecting it to become easily visible.


Nope, he still couldn't find it. After about a half hour walking him through checking The mouse connection and restarting, I just head to the site.


Really simple fix! The cursor had been on the edge of the screen, and every time he moved it, he would not only move it all the way across the screen, but *he was watching the mouse while he moved it!*.

When he finally realized his error, he decided of wasn't his error and continued to blame our software. I set the mouse locator button for him.

2937,The most 21st century thing I have ever done,"This tale takes place in 2013. D, a team manager, calls me at about 3pm my time. This is odd because D is 14 time zones away from me. Our gear includes multichannel video recording and a proprietary multichannel video player. The video is being recorded from a remotely operated vehicle as it swims around subsea and points several cameras at subsea infrastructure such as pipelines. D, who is onshore, tells me that according to the offshore team, at playback time the player is showing multiple copies of some of the camera feeds. We talk through some possible causes, tests, and remedies.

But they don’t want to fix the problem themselves — they want me to fix it. D tells me that the offshore team want me to remote in to the computer running the video player, and that they will give me TeamViewer credentials to allow me to do this. I agree, but mention that I have to leave the office at 5pm to get to my next thing.

5pm comes, and they haven’t given me credentials. I wait a few more minutes, and then shrug and set out for my bus. As I reach the bus stop, my phone vibes. It’s the email with credentials.

Well, nothing I can do now.

Or is there?

Maybe TeamViewer have a smartphone app. I check the App Store: they do. Sitting up the back of the bus, I download the app onto my 2011-era smartphone and give it the credentials. I’m connected, from the back of a bus, to a computer on a ship at sea on the other side of the planet. It’s a bit of a drinking-straw view: I’m panning around the computer screen on my phone, tapping around the UI of the video player.

Turns out the reason they’re getting two copies of one of the cameras? They’ve put two recorders on that camera feed, and they’ve placed both sets of recorded videos under the folder the player is looking in for videos. So it’s behaving exactly as designed.",1,1621434414

Weekend comes, I pay them a visit, found two ancient PCs running Win 7. One salvageable with additional RAM and maybe an SSD with a Win10 upgrade. The second, a Compaq Presario from the before times with 2gb of DDR2. I facepalmed and told them to just replace this one. The third machine, I wanted to yeet into the near by river as soon as I turned it on. After about 5 minutes, it booted up into, get this... VISTA!

I left, got home, went online, found a nice refurbished setup for a decent price, wrote up my recommendations and sent them links so they could order themselves.

They asked me to send a bill but I know their financial situation (I donate when I can) so I told them to spend the money on the replacements instead.

FWD to last night. I get a call from the accountant. Oh good, I think. They placed the order and are calling to tell me when I can come to install and transfer their data. Nope. No such luck.

Guess what, yesterday, that drive died with the only copy of lots of important info on it and they are calling to see if I can *fix* it.

... Adding an ethernet cable to my bag so I can go there and put the darn printer on the network (or just share it!)

Also... Adding a cheap NAS of some sort to the list of recommended things to buy.

2940,I keep them in the trash,"I sincerely hope I'm the only one who has experienced this, but I fear I hope in vain.

Years ago when I worked at a a small business the person who did the accounts and payroll decided to go on their first holiday in years. The temp selected to replace them had the appropriate software skills and experience, handover days were conducted, the holiday passed without incident and all seemed to go very well.

Until the holidaying accounts and payroll person's return.

They came to me, the one person IT JOAT of the company, and they looked most distressed. I was told that something or someone had *deleted a bunch of files that were required for end-of-month accounts and payroll.*

No worries, I thought. That's why we have backups, and we even test them. I confidently went looking for the files in question ... but came up dry. No matches.

This is not unheard of. Users manage to escape their roaming profiles sometimes. So I searched the user's machine too. Nothing there either.

Getting worried, I asked them to show me how they'd find the files.

They laboriously minimized every open window to get to the desktop and double clicked 🗑️. As an empty window of trash contents appeared they turned to me and pointed. ""There. See?""

I was beginning to be very afraid that I did see.

A bit of back and forth confirmed that they did, indeed, keep documents they might still need but would be getting rid of ""soon"" in the trash. To delete things, they would right click on individual documents in the trash to permanent delete just those files.

The trash, being *the trash*, was excluded from backups of roaming profiles, so no backups of these important documents that they *kept in the trash* existed.

I was able to recover slightly outdated ones from older incremental snapshots. So the user went off with much moaning to re-check and repeat a pile of work.

Did they stop putting important documents in the trash? Of course not.

But that's the story of why my old work includes trash in backups.",1,1621423279

So, to the event at hand. I specifically remember it was a day, definitely not a Saturday or a Sunday, and I was at work doing worky things. I'd been over to see one of the users in a test group for the latest print code that was waiting to be rolled out to everyone. It can cause such a stink when it goes wrong that you don't just give it to everyone for fear that now everyone can't print. You select a few. And yes, we cherry-pick. If you can form a sentence in a bug report, and can remember way, way back into the past 2 minutes and recall what you did, you get put in the top group.

2943,Always try the most difficult fix first.,"In my last company in worked as an electrician, but my colleagues and I did network Infrastructure as well (a side from managing the switches) which surprisingly was a lot of work, because somehow there was always some office remodeling going on. Also, we had a million different sites, but this one was different. It was nearly a whole village (around 15 Buildings, 9 of them belonging to us) which formed a children’s home, so everything was really spaced out.

So, we remodeled half of the village over the span of a year and during that one of the offices moved across half the village. After settling in the User complained about problems with the Internet Connection, which IT immediately forwarded to us. 

Considering the connection, nothing to surprising, it was an old phone line running across the village back to the main building, which some mad men had spliced to cat 5E equipment before we arrived. Luckily, we had some fancy signal converters for Ethernet over Phone from another site laying around, so we installed these and send the ticket back to IT.

A month later we had a new complaint, same user, same issue and after verifying with IT that they had looked into it, we estimated that the connection between the main Building and the Off-shot office just had to be to long (around 70m) or might be interfered somewhere and pulled a new Cat 7 cable. The old installation was inside a spacious pipe, so after a long day of driving (did I mention the one hour drive to and from the site), praying and pulling, we had a shiny new cable, swapped all patch-cables and one unmanaged switch for good measure and went home.

Two months later IT asked, when we will fix the issue. I happily told them, what we did and after another week, they confirmed, that it didn’t work as intended.

Cue, a day of desperation and hard decisions. We had tested the connection and it seemed good to us and the user reported sporadic connectivity, so we reconsidered the site and it hit us like bricks. There was a transformer station only a few meters from our cable. Could it be that these madmen had thrown the pipe just in the same trench as the high-voltage lines and the crosstalk just limited the connection severely?

Short jump forward, we installed fiber, had a special company come out to splice the lines and told IT, that we were done with it.

A few weeks later (almost half a year after this madness started) I met the User on occasion and she complained about the not working Connection… definitely not in a unpleasant way, just like some utterly hopeless, who had come to terms with it. By chance I had my Laptop with me (Highly unusual, I only used it to configure our entrance system on a different site), so I decided to give it another crack and start tracing down the Issue, simply by plugging the Laptop into every Port I could find along the way.

First port; her office, everything works fine. I was baffled, switched back to user’s PC and bam, connection gone. Her network card was faulty… These fuckers in IT hadn’t bothered to check her network card in half a year… 

Conclusion: user still offers me cookies every time we meet and I afterwards didn’t talk to IT for about 4 months and later only when they promised me, they actually checked their end first.",1,1621358004

2945,You spend how much on paper?!,"If you worked in a law firm before the 2010s you can skip this next 3 paragraphs, or don't if your blood needs a little reminiscence-boiling. For the rest of you, let me explain paper.

If you've not worked there you might think of law firms as floating in money from the ridiculous fees they charge for the most minor of tasks like a 2-second phone call, and that they probably waste half of it. You're right. When it comes to printing law firms are nuts. They still are, but before the early 2010s they were on an even higher level. I stood still in a spot in a law firms office in 2002ish and I could reach out and touch 4 HP4000 printers, all with 2 additional trays and the manual feed tray in use. 5 types of stationary. And from that same spot there was the big floor-standing HP8000 just 6 feet away. That was for the big-prints and it just had reams (literally) of plain paper in it. The reason for all this? Nothing and everything. 

Law firms *have to* print the first page of the client copy on headed paper, all subsequent pages on continuation paper, which is like headed but usually a smaller logo and address block pushed up to a thin header of the page. File copies are on plain white paper with a ""File Copy"" watermark printed diagonally over it, or in the header, or somewhere else, and the plain paper might be the same plain for normal printing, or the lawyers might have argued they want heavier stock as they're dealing with it every day and they're the ones that bring in the damn money, or maybe it's green paper because reasons. Then you'll have a different watermark for a Copy in the situation where the original was lost, on plain paper, or headed and continuation, or blue, why the hell not? Then there's faxes (yes. Yes. In 2010? Yes. But not now, right? Wrong. Still faxes), compliment slips, and a bunch of other ways of printing that I've therapeutically removed from my memory. 

""How can this ever work?"" I hear you scream. In short, really really complicated printing code, often Word macros, massive print dialogs, and an array of print-like-this buttons. If you've ever wondered why IT is making a big deal about the amazing deal you can get on CompetitorCorp printers and why they're so attached to their printer brand.....ta-dah.

With all of these requirements on printing there's inevitable waste. People load the wrong tray, or print to the wrong tray. There's a lot of thrown away paper, and therefore there's a market for saving printing costs. Enter MyCorp with our amazing software to make printing more accurate, saving time and frustration. I jest, but it really was good. The saving had to be plaid down to make it believable.

As you can imagine, every firm is different, so we'd have to have a couple of ours at the client with questions and calculators to work out how much we thought the product would cost and save. We did so for one company who had the most ridiculous printing requirement I ever saw. They needed 2 copies of a file copy, one for the partners files, and one for the account file. The partners one was to be printed on plain white paper. The accounts file was to be printed on green paper. To solve this, they had botched together some code to print page 1 twice, page 2 twice, page 3 twice, etc, to a specific tray. That tray, ladies and gentlemen was filled with interleafed white and green paper.

What's even better is that every now and then someone would accidentally print an email to that tray. 3 pages in the bin. And now the top page is green. So when someone prints their document the green one is on top, so they throw that away. I could never understand that part. They separate them manually afterwards because they hate their staff I guess, so what does it matter?

So we went over it all and we calculated that our ~£50K software would save them ~£330K every year. And ~£300K of that was the cost and waste cost associated with this green paper. Bristling with pride and thinking about the wonderful case study this could make for our product we presented it to them and it got rejected. I'm sorry. What? They said no? We could not understand it at all. We had suggested a watermark over the green paper, and this was a point they raised. Sure that we could still make enourmous savings and bag ourselves a client we re-did the numbers with a tray of just green paper. It's ridiculous, but if they have to have green paper it will still save a ton of money getting reams of just green paper. The savings were down to about ~£180K. This is annual savings for a one-off cost, with a small annual fee.

Still they said no.

A few months later after another site visit, and most definitely in the pub, my boss was told that one of the partners sons happens to run a printing company that, wouldn't you know it, supplies the firms paper.",1,1621348609

Any time something suspicious happened we had to fill out an incident report, which was a long form that was overly complex and was almost never followed up on. I hated doing them. But if we didn't and our calls were audited, bam disciplinary action. You wouldn't think I would have to do them that often, what could happen when I'm getting calls because people don't know how to turn on their computer?

&amp;#x200B;

Enter stage right, Martha, a very friendly woman who calls me and says she is unable to get into her account. Of course I immediately start to look into it and try and resolve the issue. The account is locked. No big deal, that happens all the time. People enter the passwords wrong, account gets locked, uncheck a box that says it's locked and they are good to go. Start to fill out the quick incident ticket to track what I've been doing before I finish, when she whispers ""Could you hurry? My boss had all my accounts turned off and my last day is today so I really need to get back in there and grab some stuff.""

&amp;#x200B;

Super. Look her up in our system, tell her to please hold while I work on her issue. Call her boss and tell him what's happening and then hear on the other end when she's escorted out of the building. Hang up, file a security report. Not the best way to start the day.",1,1621259948

As much as I'd like to tell an epic tale... The meetings were all in regards to an entirely different access control system... one that had been migrated to the other company's server back in October.

Our company had a stupid naming convention of renaming depreciated systems/ procedures/ whatever by pre-pending the name with a particular letter... a letter that also matches the first letter of  of our company.

Apparently the access control I migrated in October, had been one of 3 systems,  two of them with exactly matching names, except the second one started with the depreciation indicating letter. Fortunately backups were restored and feathers easily unruffled.

The third system? still down. On server backups got wiped out by an enthusiastic tech. Turns out the off-server/off site backups had never been setup, ""since that server is going to be decommissioned anyway""

The guy who is in charge of the 3rd access system? He contacted me Wednesday. The third party vendor will be re-doing everything. he's not happy that he was never listed as a contact or process owner, but accepts what happened.

2960,PC having problem booting up after thunderstorm," 

So as title says, yesterday there was thunderstorm in my area. I had my PC on when it suddenly shuts down. Now when I try to boot it up it's acting weird. I guess some electrical surge have damaged my pc parts. But it's strange.

Firstly I tested all components and I was left with only MB,CPU and PSU. All others are working just fine. Of course there is RAM and disks but they are only for boot in video. So when I try to start it up, I have to hold my power button for 30s which is obviously first thing wrong. (After further testing i discovered that, if i reset my BIOS with CMOS battery it starts normally,but only for that one sequence.) After that PC boots up almost normal way, but few seconds into it power just cuts off. Every led,fan,component is working even ones on MB so I guess it can't be MB or? Only difference is that MB beep sound disappeared. It keeps repeating the boot cycle until i plug off PC. I will post video in coments to show it more. I can't test PSU rn so I thought about asking here. Do you have any idea or experience what might cause it? Is it broken MB or just the PSU? Or something else? Thanks for all advices.

2966,A personal tale of woe that all started with a cheap laptop off ebay.,"Pour a drink this is an account of a 3 week period and much happened.  


So I have a Pioneer casette receiver and some Sony speaker and i've been keeping an eye out for a CD player, HDD based media player and a visualiser as my hi-fi is modelled after the Limoship of Hotblack Desiato which is cool but I like to have a bit of flair when i'm listening to music.  
The combined cost the extras starts at £150 and so i've been looking to add bits as and when, then I had an epiphany why not buyh a cheap laptop and hook it up to the hi-fi, save money and have a better display than any VU meter or other visualisation component.  


So I bought a piece of junk from 2008 that would've been junk the day it rolled out of the factory, it claimed to have 1GB RAM, a DVD multiwriter, a 40GB HDD and wi-fi, it had no declared faiults bar a dead battery but as it's just a hi-fi component it doesn't need to go anywhere.",1,1621116372
2967,Fortunately she had a niece," I do not work in tech support. I did, however, spend this spring volunteering to file people's taxes, and since some of these people are on the elderly side - you would be surprised, or maybe y'all in particular wouldn't, how many of them don't own a computer and don't trust that technology nonsense - I ended up doing more tech support than I ever thought I would need to.

&amp;#x200B;

This particular day starts as usual: I log onto Zoom and the website we use to organize clients, get assigned two people to call about their documents in a hour's window, and go to work. One of the two has a dependent and checked some boxes but doesn’t have the corresponding documents, while the other, an older woman, appears to have her relatively simple documents in order. I call client number two - I'll call her Auntie - first because I decide she will be faster.

&amp;#x200B;

To be fair, the call starts at a good pace, even though Auntie decides 'let me go through some questions with you' means 'read off random lines of information from your documents before I can say anything'. At least, until she mentions a document that I don't have. That's fine, she can send it later, we'll move on. But then there's another missing document. And another. Three documents I need and don't have.

&amp;#x200B;

I ask if she has a computer, as I have already learned that this is not a universal constant. She says yes. I continue with the provided script and tell her I can send her a link for her to upload. I ask if she knows how to do that, again a learned non-universal constant.

&amp;#x200B;

She laughs like I've said something funny. “I don’t know how to download, let alone upload!” she tells me. 

&amp;#x200B;

She suggests mailing them. I ask her to hold on a sec and type a desperate message to the site lead. The lead gets back to me and says no, the documents must be securely uploaded via the provided link. It is now 40 minutes into my hour time slot;   I tell him I'm gonna need him to reschedule my other client, and the one for the next hour just to be safe, and return to Auntie.  

&amp;#x200B;

Auntie is going to need to take pictures of the documents with her phone, get those pictures to her computer, and then get them uploaded via the link I emailed her. I am going to have to guide her through this sight unseen over the phone. I am out of my depth, but fueled by the spirit of volunteerism. Auntie is likewise fueled by the desire not to do her own taxes. We can (probably) do this.

&amp;#x200B;

First I have to hang up for ten minutes because she doesn't know how to take photos and call someone at the same time. This gives me some time to formulate a game plan. When I call her back, I ask if her phone has wifi. According to her, no. I am highly skeptical about this, but rather than argue I move to plan B: I ask her to find her phone charger and see if the cable can unplug from the part that goes into the outlet. I had to explain it several different ways before she got it, but the delighted realization in Auntie's voice when she found out the end of the cord that -doesn't- go in her phone could connect it to her computer was pretty motivating.

&amp;#x200B;

Now that Auntie has the phone connected, I have to walk her through navigating her computer to upload the pictures. Frankly, I do about as terrible a job at this as she does describing her screen to me. All hope seems lost - until she utters these magic words as she systematically lists off the contents of her desktop in hopes of somehow finding the pictures there:

&amp;#x200B;

""something called TeamViewer - oh! My niece installed this thing called TeamViewer for me when she set up this computer for me. Can we use that?""

&amp;#x200B;

Yes, Auntie, yes we can. It might be against regulations, but I am now an hour and a half into this call and emotionally invested in seeing this through; better to ask forgiveness and all that. Again, it took a few tries for her to get me connected, but we got there. Now that I can see her screen, the finish line is in sight!

&amp;#x200B;

Only, when I click on her phone, it shows me an empty folder. Clicking out and clicking back in doesn't change it. Having her disconnect and reconnect the phone doesn't change it. I don't know what's happening, and frantically googling the type of phone she has gives me nothing. It's the last thing I want to do, but I'm about ready to tell her she'll have to go to an in-person site to upload her documents.

&amp;#x200B;

""There's this message on my phone asking me if I want to share with this device, should I do something about that?"" she abruptly asks me like a welcome clue-by-four to the back of the head.

&amp;#x200B;

Oh. Right. That's a thing I forgot you needed to do. Yes Auntie, please click yes for me. Yes, also on the computer.

&amp;#x200B;

Fortunately, that was the last difficult step. I got Auntie's pictures uploaded while she told me all about how her family got her this computer since her old one was slowing down and I told her an explanation of what I was doing that goes in one ear and out the other. I know this because the pictures she first took were too blurry to be used, and when I asked her if she wanted to try uploading them herself the second time around she loudly and panickedly declined before I could finish my sentence.

&amp;#x200B;

After we finished up, she thanked me for bearing with her. I told her I was happy to help, and I was! Auntie happily went on her way with a story to tell her niece and all her documents in order to file her taxes. I went away with a story to tell all of you and a newfound appreciation for elderly women's nieces.",1,1621115604

2973,Thunka-Thunka-Thunka,"Years and years ago, when I was still in high school, I was already doing tech support for my friends. There was this one friend, that while wasn't the smartest, was nice, but broke a lot of things with what he did. This meant that I wasn't surprised when he called saying that his new comp was having issues.

I went over and took a look at his new computer. This was the time when the case was solid metal, the computer cost thousands and weighed a lot.

His father was somewhat rich and had just bought him the computer, but was also doing work on the house. So when I opened the comp up, I found the insides had been coated with sheetrock dust. I told him I'd be back the next day with what I needed to clean the comp.

I left and came back the next day and as I walked into the house, I heard a strange noise, it was like thunka-thunka-thunka, over and over. I asked him what that noise was and he said I should be proud of him, he was cleaning the comp himself. I asked him again what the noise was, a bit worried now, he replied that it was the comp going through the rinse cycle.

Now very worried, I told him to show me and he took me to the laundry room and there in a front loading washing machine was the comp going around in the machine. Each time it slammed into the drum it made a thunka noise.

I watched it for a moment before asking him if that how he would clean his SNES, this made him stop and look at me in shock, as realization set in, and asked what should we do. I said first we needed to get the comp out and see what the damage was. So we got the machine to drain and spin down and pulled out the machine. I also saw that the metal case of the computer had destroyed the washing machine's drum. 

So we opened up the comp and found it was basically green soup inside, every board shattered into small pieces. At this point I put the comp back together and began to walk to the front door, this was last straw in a long line of things he wanted me fix that he broke. As I walked toward the door, he asked what he should do and I told him to rebox the computer and send it back to the manufacturer. When he asked me what he should tell them, I waited till I was in the door and told him, just as I was closing the door behind me, I said, ""Tell them that you're too dumb to own a computer.""

2974,Bought the wrong software and don't want to admit you made a mistake? Cool; pay 5x as much and lose your job.," This happened over 20 years ago.  Conversations from memory may have minor details altered, but the  story's the same. TLDR at the end.

I  had worked about two years at this point for a MSP (at the time called a  systems integrator), and they generously paid for the engineers/techs  to obtain industry certifications. I started out as an on-call  contractor setting up desktops, and they hired me on full-time after  about 3 months.

By the time the MC  occurred, I had worked my way up to junior level engineer, obtained my  MCSE, CNA and was working towards my CNE and Cisco certs. At the time,  Novell and Microsoft were neck and neck in server operating system  dominance, hence getting both certs. With book study and field  experience, I wasn't an expert, but I held my own.

One  day I get called into the boss' office to meet with him, the owner, and  the salesperson. The owner told me with a gleam in his eye that the  company just landed a major, high profile client: our city's pro  basketball team, and they've agreed to give us a small task to prove  ourselves. I was to install and configure backup software on their  Windows Server (important later) and test to ensure it works. The team   offered the carrot of not only signing a long term support contract, but  also a recommendation to their business partners and other teams if I  was successful. This was definitely within my wheelhouse. I figured 1  hour tops, in and out.

I showed up  to the arena, checked in with security, and I'm escorted to the  business office area. A lady we'll call Karen comes out and introduces  herself as the CIO. Karen spent the first 45 minutes of my time there to  take me on a grand tour... of the business office. I saw the owners'  offices, the GM's office, her office, pictures of framed, autographed  jerseys, the nearly empty trophy case, and the big glass window that  overlooks the court. She even said I'm welcome to eat lunch in the staff  dining area. She then said she's taking me to the server room.

In  another circumstance, I would've considered the tour a treat, but three  things. First, I had another client to see that day, and this was  messing up my schedule. Not a big deal, I can have the office call the  client to move the visit back a little. Second, the team hadn't exactly  been playing championship caliber basketball except the last two years  prior. Before that, they made the playoffs twice in 15 years and got  their heads kicked in both times. Third, my favorite basketball team is  this team's rival, so it's cool, but I'm not over the moon.

Then  she asked if I was ready to see the server room. We turn a couple of  corners, and she unlocked the door to... a really small office. Boxes  stacked in one corner, spare furniture in another. At the back wall sat  an old school CRT monitor hooked to an old school KVM switchbox on a  desk connected to two tower computers sitting side by side on the  carpeted floor. Right next to the monitor sat a stack of network  switches with a spaghetti of cables that ran haphazardly up the wall and  into a removed panel of the fake ceiling.

On  top of the towers sat a box with the backup software. Karen waved her  hand at the setup, pointed to a sheet with some handwriting on it, said I  should have everything I need, and she'll be in her office if I had any  questions. She left me to it, and after I called the home office to  reschedule my other client, I started assessing the situation.

I  quickly saw the first problem: the NetWare server was already setup to  run backups but going by the status report date on the screen, backups  hadn't been running for months. The software was only an add-on module  to backup email folders. Using the credentials on the sheet, I logged in  to the Windows server running Exchange to handle all the email. I tried  to look at different settings, and I quickly realized I only had  limited permissions. I logged to the Novell server, and I didn't have  enough permissions. I walked back to the CIO's office.

So  far, Karen's been pretty chill, but suddenly Karen flipped the Karen  switch on. Maybe I didn't seem impressed enough with the tour.

Me: Two problems. First, I need admin permissions to do the work you need done. Second--

Karen: Why do you need admin permissions?

Me: To... install and configure the backup software? The software also--

Karen: Why can't you just use the accounts I gave you?

Me: Because... they don't have enough permissions? Also the backup soft--

Karen:  My other tech (let's call him Paul) uses those accounts fine to run the  backups. Why do YOU need extra permissions? (Picks up the desk phone  and dials) Hey Paul, could you come to my office now, please? Thanks.

Me: Probably because he has backup operator permissions. Higher permissions are needed to install software. Speaking of which--

Karen: (after Paul knocks on the door and enters). Have you had any problems with the daily backups?

Paul: No. Why?

Karen: federalant9 here says he needs extra permissions to install the backup software. Do you agree?

Paul: (Looks side to side) I'm not sure as I just handle the deskto--

Karen: If Paul can manage backups with those accounts, I don't see why you can't install the software, federalant9.

Me: How did you install the software originally?

Karen: All of this was setup before I started here, and I was brought in to clean all of this up.

Me: Is there anyone else who manages the servers?

Karen: No, it's just me and him.

Me: I see. Would you come with me please? I need to show you something.

Karen: Why?

Me: It's easier to show you than explain.

Karen rolls her eyes, gets up from her desk, and motions for Paul to come with. We all go back to the ""server room.""

Me: Ok, first let me ask. My understanding is you want the backup software installed on the Windows server, right?

Karen:  Of course, so it can perform brick-level backups of the email. You guys  said you were sending one of your best; how do you not know about  backups?

Me: That's why I'm  asking. You bought an add-on module for the Novell server (showing her  where it says on the box). I can't install this on Windows.

Karen:  (snatches the box from my hand). I called the software company myself  and ordered it from them directly after I told them the setup here. Are  you saying they lied to me and sold me the wrong product or made a  mistake?

Me: No, I'm not saying  that as I wasn't part of the conversation. I'm only saying this is for  Novell, and I can't install this on Windows.

Karen: So they sold me the wrong software?

Me: Can we go to their website or call them?

Karen: (Rolls her eyes) fine. Let's go back to my office.

Back  at her office, she sat down, went to the website while I stood behind  her, then spun around to me with a smirk on her face after a few mouse  clicks. ""See? This is what I bought. It says right here it will backup  Microsft Exchange servers.""

Me: Well, this doesn't say brick level backups. And, it says for Novell servers. Can you click where it says Microsoft?

Karen:  (Sighs and clicks). This is pointless. I bought what I bought because  it's half the cost. When I called, they said this would also back up my  Exchange server. Why would it backup a Windows Server but not install on  a Windows Server? That makes no sense.

Me:  (pointing to the screen) It says right there the Windows version  performs brick level backups. The NetWare version will backup the  emails, but the entire database. And it will restore the entire database  as one file, but it can't do brick-level backups or restores. A server  can backup anything as long as it can see it on a network and it has  permissions to it.

Karen: Here's  the bottom line. They told me this would work. I'm paying you to make  this work, so make it work. Or tell me you can't make it work and I'll  find someone who can.

Me: It'll  work but not like how you think. And if you want to (air quotes) ""make  it work"" it will only install on Novell. Can I show you?

Karen: (Sighs and hands me the software box).

Me: I still need an admin login.

After  several more minutes of debate over the admin login, she reluctantly  logged me into the Windows server. I put the CD into the Windows server,  and nothing happened. I brought up the CD in Explorer to show her  folders and files, but no executable and no way really to install. She  unlocked the Novell console, I inserted the CD, mounted it, and the  install auto-ran. I didn't look back, but I could feel her eyes burning  holes into the back of my head.

In  about 30 minutes, I installed the software, configured it to backup the  Exchange server boxes as well as the rest of the data on both servers,  and performed a successful test backup all while she hovered over me  with her arms crossed. I noticed that backups hadn't been running, and  after checking the logs to find the problem, I configured the scheduled  service to login with the backup operator account credentials. Tested  again successfully.

Me: By the  way, your backups haven't been running for about 3 months. I fixed that  for you. The scheduled service didn't have a login account configured,  so I plugged in the backup operator username/password.

Karen:  What do you mean?!? You saw the status screen when we walked in and it  said a successful backup?!? And you said you needed admin rights?!?

Me:  Yes, that was the LAST successful backup which was months ago.  (Switching to the logfile on screen) Here's the date and time of the  last successful backup. Configuring a backup job and installing software  are two different tasks that need two different sets of permissions.

Karen  stomped to the door, opened it, and yelled for Paul. When he arrived,  she lit into him so loudly someone from the cubicles came into the room  to see what the problem was. I still feel bad about that because it  wasn't Paul's fault...

After three  hours, I left and immediately called my boss from the car, explaining  exactly what happened. Sure enough, Karen had already called. My boss  reassigned my other client and asked me to come back. When I got back to  the office, the owner, my boss, and I went to the conference room, and  we setup a conference call with Karen and the backup software support  team.

They looked up Karen's  account, and politely explained that according to the notes, they told  Karen to buy the Windows version for brick-level backups of Exchange  email accounts. But Karen balked at the price, so they offered her the  Novell version with the caveat that it would perform entire Exchange  database backups and user folders only. I wasn't completely right but  right enough.

Karen now insisted  that they only sold her what they sold her because she threatened to buy  their competitor's software. After she demanded a supervisor, the  supervisor got on the call and said she needed to buy the correct  software, they would make an exception to their no refunds on opened  software policy, and give her a partial credit. Otherwise, she could go  ahead and buy the competitor's software and she would get no refund at  all. Karen huffed and puffed and tried playing the ""do you know who I  work for"" card, but they wouldn't budge. She had no other choice.

After  the software company hung up, Karen asked the owner when he could send  me out to finish the job. He muted the phone and asked me if I wanted to  go back out there, and I said no. He asked me if I would go if he sent a  senior there with me, and I agreed. He then unmuted and told Karen that  to make sure there are no issues, he was sending me with a senior  engineer, and he made a deal with her. If the senior corrected my work,  there would be no charge for service. However, if I was correct, then  she would pay for my time today plus the time for both me and the senior  on the second visit. Also, she would need to make sure that we had full  administrative access, and not hover while we worked. Agree to all  conditions or we don't come back. Karen agreed and added in that she  would definitely not work with us again then hung up abruptly.

We  went back after Karen got the correct software, I installed it without a  hitch even though she had enabled remote desktop on the server to watch  me. I also wrote up a job aid for Paul with screenshots to manage  backup jobs. The senior saw I knew what I was doing, so to pass the time  he made a list of recommendations for her: server racks, anti-static  mats, UPS, racks for the switches, cable management, adequate  ventilation and temperature controls, physically securing the room,  disaster recovery plan, etc. He emailed them to Karen and cc'ed me, my  boss, and the owner. The invoice we sent her charged her for 3 hours for  my first visit, plus the hour at my rate and another hour for the  senior at the higher rate.

A few  months later, my boss told me they got a call back from the team's new  CIO. He said after the team restructured the business unit, he took  Karen's place and hired additional staff. Paul discovered the  recommendation list among a bunch of emails Karen had deleted with a  brick-level restore of her emails that I setup. The new CIO wanted to  know how soon the company could send someone to complete the  recommendation list and consult his staff on additional recommendations.  Since the new CIO was hiring his own staff, he wouldn't need us for a  long term support contract, but he would definitely call us when he  needed any work done they couldn't handle.

TLDR;  CIO Karen buys the wrong software and won't admit it, pays 5x the  service hours needed to do the work, tried to delete the recommendation  list my coworker emails to her, and the new CIO restores the email of  recommendations from the software I configured after she's fired.",1,1621005477

$Customer: Yes hello, I can't connect to my WiFi, can you help me.

\-after getting customer details 

$Me: Ok madam, so you don't see your network when you try to connect to your WiFi. Do you see any other WiFi networks on your device?

$Customer: Yes I see plenty of others, but not my own network. 

$Me: Alright, let's check if there's anything wrong with the mode. 

\*Does modem test\* 

$Me: Ok, your modem seems fine and connected to the internet. How far are you currently from your modem? 

$Customer: Why? Does that matter?

$Me: (something's up here, starting to realize I didn't really bother to ask where she is). Well... the range from which the modem can spread it's wireless signal is limited, if you're too far away from it and there's too many walls in between then the signal might not reach.

$Customer: Aha.. well I'm a good 150 kilometers away (about 70/80 miles for you Imperialists). We're at our holiday adress near the sea.

$Me: (dying inside, trying not to laugh)... well that explains it. You see, technically the wireless signal from your modem goes about 10-15 meters. Usually enough for most households, but definitely not enough to cover that amount of distance....

$Customer: but... I thought I had wireless internet so I just could connect everywhere. (sad voice) They even advertized it as such. 

$Me: You do have wireless internet, but there are limitations madam. The ""everywhere"" part is referring to the \*ISP name\* hotspots which are available through the country for our customers. But obviously if there's no hotspot near you can't have internet.

$Customer: Oh... so I can't have wireless internet here? 

$Me: \*helps customer through setting up a 2nd internet connection for her vacation adress\*

I did make a sale out of it, which was rare because I liked the technical support stuff more. But damn the moment she said she was a good 150km away from her modem absolutely killed me. Tears of laughter at that time...

$Customer: Hello yeah, we are a big electronics store in Belgium and we received a shipping of your \*multifunctional printers/scanner\* (called MFD from now on), but we can't find the scanners.. Do you know where they are?

\-Already a weird story, but I do the usual and create a ticket, get the customer details, etc. Then the following takes place

$Me: So, can you confirm the model of the product is \*MFD\*? 

$Customer: Yes that's exactly the model we ordered

$Me: ... ok (confused), but sir that model is a multifunctional device, meaning the scanner is part of the printer. What do you mean by you don't know where the scanner is?

$Customer: Well, we opened the box and sure enough we found the printers, but the scanner doesn't seem to be in the box. Is it maybe supposed to come in a different shipment?

*At this point I'm losing it. Because I'm starting to realize, this is an electronics store, that somehow doesn't know the scanner is literally part of the printer, eg the scanning part is usually the lid on the top of the device. Its common for years in our devices and other companies MFD's already, and I don't know how an electronics store employee doesn't know it, let stand the whole freaking floor there.* 

$Me: No no, I mean it's literally part of the printer. It's the lid on the top, do you have one of the \*MFD\* models close to you right now?

$Customer: Yes I'm standing next to it.

$Me: You see the top part, you can open it from, what do you see?

$Customer: I see sort of a glass plate

$Me: Exactly, that is the scanner... the \*MFD\* is multifunctional, e.g. the scanner is integrated with the printer. It's not in some seperate box (trying to supress laughter at this point)

$Customer: ..... ah.. I see...(obviously feels stupid) we opened literally every box here trying to find the scanners, but this explains it. Thank you so much. 

$Me: No problem sir, thank you for calling.

So I hang up and I nearly died laughing, which prompted the supervisor the ask me what happened. When I told him the story he agreed it was hilarious and allowed me to go on a 5 minute break because I couldn't keep it together anymore.

Fast forward to Christmas time. I finally am able to take a day off. Or so I think. About 7:00 am the phone rings. Wakes me up. It's one of our shop guys.

Awesome. 

I tell him thanks for the heads up. Let me know when power is restored. I'll log in and check on everything. While we're on the phone he tells me we lost all phases and now it's pitch black in the building. Great.

she said to me: “[First name] - I’m so sorry. Your hard drive - she is dead!”
She sounded so sad!
And then she sent me a brand new hard drive!

I got a call from a customer who complained that his 16 month old HP Envy kept bluescreening over and over, and had a fan error, and ran very slow.

Me: So, when you power on the computer, you get a ""fan error""?

Customer: Yes, it says ""Fan error: The system has detected that the fan is not functional. Operating the computer can cause potential damage to your computer. Are you sure you want to continue?"" and then it says ""Press F1 to continue"".

Customer: Oh, I really needed to use it. It has another problem, it keeps bluescreening over and over, and if it bluescreens and I reboot, it instantly bluescreens again. Want me to show you the error?

Me: No! You should not be powering on your computer, you can actually break it that way! The warning is telling you that the cooling fan isnt working because if it overheats it will break, and nobody will be able to fix it!"" (Note: I worded it this way to simplify it so he would understand).

Customer: But it was working before.

Me: I will check to see if it has been damaged by overheating. Next time, don't ignore messages like that. 

Customer: Well I was doing that for a few weeks and it was working fine before, but now it won't even boot up. It just says it's booting forever and never finishes. 

Me: Well, first, I will have to fix the fan in order to properly diagnose it after. That will be $55 for the fan, and let's see what else it needs from there.


What was happening, is that after 5 minutes of thermal throttling, it would eventually crash and reboot. Without giving time to cool off, he would try and use it again immediately, rinse and repeat.

But we're just getting to the fun part!

After the fan arrived, and I re-pasted it, installed the fan, and tightened some very loose hinges, booted, Windows would not load from the drive properly. Most of you know what this means... The windows install may be corrupt, or the drive is damaged so, I pull all the files off the NVME drive using an enclosure bridge, and it takes FOREVER. I mean, 1kbps and 100% active time... Checked the drive, and it had tons of CRC errors, AT LEAST 70 COUNTS of over-temp threshold, and it had thousands of re-allocated sectors. AKA, the drive was fucking fried to death. It took me 40 hours to even image the drive, and another 10 hours of testdisk operation to then extract his files from the drive, most of them anyway, along with a partial directory tree. 

Me: Hello, I figured out why windows did not boot even though it booted before. Your SSD is damaged due to severe overheating. You can replace them for about $75, and then I would charge another $35 to install it and install Windows and copy your user files back. I have a drive here in stock, it's an SK Hynix Gold P31, it performs roughly the same as the Intel H10 that is in your computer, but is much cheaper, and not prone to overheating like the Intel one. I also have an ADATA drive which I could use, and would only cost $30, and it's lightly used.

Customer: Used?! Can you just get another Intel one? I want to get a good quality drive. Mine was an SSD, can you make sure it's an SSD?

Me: The SK Hynix is a well known brand, the performance is about as good, and the reliability is better in most tests. Any NVME compatible drive is going to be an SSD, they do not make NVME hard drives, they're not small enough.

Customer: I have not heard of SK Hynix, are you sure they're good? What is the warranty?

Me: They make the SSD's found in many smartphones, and they supply SSD's to Acer, HP, Lenovo, and other companies. You probably never heard of them because they do not sell in stores, but mostly to other companies in bulk. I have one in my own laptop too, for what it's worth. This Intel H10 drive that was in it is a QLC flash, so they also wear out faster than the SK Hynix TLC. QLC means that each little cell that holds data has to hold a little more data, so every time you write a file, it has to do extra wear. (I know I know this is very very dumbed down, but this is about how it went because this customer wanted an answer he couldn't understand). But QLC is cheaper than TLC, except Intel. The 512GB Intel drive is $140 while the SK Hynix is $75. If you would like me to order an exact replacement, I can order one now and it will be here in 3 days, or I can charge you $75 and give you the SK Hynix now, as that's what I keep stocked. 

Customer: Oh that's expensive. Can you not get it cheaper?

Me: I know, Intel drives are overpriced in my opinion and not very good quality. But it's your decision, if you want to. If I put another Intel drive in it, I will probably remove the metal cover over the drive because it traps the heat in and does not let the fan recirculate the air in there.

Customer: Ok bro, fine, I trust you, but if it breaks I will blame you. (I don't like customers like this, who blame you for everything that happens after, but it's part of the job)

Me: Don't worry. They have a 5 year warranty, the same as most drives like this. Alrighty, so the total here is going to be $75 for the drive, $21 for the fan, $35 for the fan replacement, and $35 for the hard drive replacement and Windows installation and file transfer. That makes your total $166, for everything. It will be ready tonight in a few hours, or you can pick it up tomorrow. 

Customer: Oh come on man the computer is only a year old, can't you give me a break? I came to you without any referral or anything

Me: I'm sorry. My prices are as low as they can be, and I already didn't charge you for data recovery, as I hadn't even mentioned the possibility, so I already gave you a discount. Any other shop would have charged at least $200 just to swap your hard drive and install windows alone, even without the fan, so I think my prices are more than fair. 

Customer: OK fine bro thanks

This customer's laptop was dinged up, a huge dent in the back, warped screen, looked like it was sat on... Why do all the worst customers also abuse the shit out of their computers? 

TL;DR Customer ignores BIOS warning message about a broken fan overheating and damaging a computer. Proceeds to damage M.2 SSD drive sitting next to the CPU. Doesn't like the brand I chose because he knows the name ""Intel"" and wants a ""name brand"" ssd, and then only agrees when I tell him Intel drive is twice the cost and slower performance. Replaced the fan and heat pipe, hard drive, recovered data off his failing drive, installed windows and even installed a list of software he asked for, all for $70 + parts, and asked for a discount. If I knew it would be at least 4 hours of total labor, I would have charged him at least $100. 

P.S. SK Hynix Gold benched 3620MB/s read, 3,341MB/s write, which is above advertised. It's actually faster than the Intel H10 according to CrystalDiskInfo. Love these drives. There are lots of good drives by Adata, Teamgroup, Inland, and even Silicon Power, but SK Hynix has had the least compatibility issues, the most consistent performance across different hardware, and both of the failed SK Hynix drives that came in had locked into read-only mode, unable to boot, but was able to successfully image the drive, for easy data recovery, while most just... die.",1,1620951044

Since I don't indulge in caffeine, I call $HT right away. Maybe the endorphin rush of solving a problem would wake me up a bit. ^(it didn't)

**$TM**: Hey $HT, how's it going today?

**$HT**: I'm fine $TM, lemme show you what the heck my email is doing.

$HT proceeds to show me what the heck his email is doing and for once, it is indeed broken. So broken that $HT was unable to do a big part of his job. The problem was strange and the error message was cryptic, so we're gonna skip the 30 minutes of uninterrupted troubleshooting.

**$HT**: $TM, my boss is calling and I need to take this. I'm gonna mute myself, give me a shout if you need me to do something.

Happy with the silence, I continue to troubleshoot for another 15 minutes without needing $HT to do anything. I finally find a temporary^(TM) workaround and attempt to hail $HT to no avail. After trying a few more times, I assume that he left his desk and leave the call, updating the ticket (CYA CYA CYA) with the very simple workaround explained. I also left a note in the ticket (users can't see this, only the helpdesk team and $SB can) explaining that I pulled up the ticket on his machine, made the window fullscreen and highlighted my update, along with a notepad file on his other screen telling him to read the update to my ticket. I minimized all other windows so I thought there was no way he could miss this ^((he did)) and I covered my ass enough ^((I didn't)).

Few situations rustle up a feeling of uncertain ambivalence like a quiet day on helpdesk. Either everything is working or everything is so broken they can't even report an issue. Lucky for me, it was the former today. Until $SB called, of course.

**$SB**: What's going on with $HT? He reached out to me and said that you left the call this morning without fixing his issue or scheduling a follow up.

**$TM**: I'm still working on his issue but I gave him a workaround. I know it works, I tested it multiple times and left an update in the ticket explaining it.

**$SB**: He never mentioned a workaround. Let me conference him in and see what he says.

**$SB**: Hey $HT, I've got $TM here with me. He said he updated your ticket with a workaround, were you able to try that out?

**$HT**: A workaround?? I was never given one, $TM left our call when I was away for a minute and left me hanging!

**$TM**: I'm sorry for leaving our call, I tried to get your attention several times. I assumed that you had left your desk or your call was too important to be pulled away from so I updated your ticket, opened it up on your main screen, left a note on your other screen, and went on my way.

**$HT**: You did?? I didn't see any of that! Well let's see this workaround buddy, I got emails to send!

I proceed to show him the workaround, explaining each step (all 3!) in detail and have him do it multiple times to make sure he gets it. $HaplessTexan exits stage left happily on his way and $SB picks up where we left off.

**$SB**: So I read the ticket while you were helping him out just now.

**$TM**: Yeah? So you can see that I tried my best to make it easy for him.

**$SB**: I can see that you made it *look* like you tried your best. Maybe take a screenshot next time.

2985,"Ez Debug VGA LED, PC crash when gaming (no overheating), GPU usage fluctuates between 0-100% quiclkly!!!! HELP!!!!"," PC Specs:

* CPU: Ryzen 5 2600
* GPU: AMD Radeon Rx570
* Mobo: MSI x470 Gaming Pro
* RAMS: HyperX Fury DDR4
* PSU: Aresgame AGW 600W (80+ Bronze)

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Problems:

\- Ez Debug VGA led comes on everytime when powering the PC on

1. When that happens: Black screen, peripherals all aren't working

* Temporary fixes I made that sometimes work:  

   * Laid the pc on its side and insert GPU so that there is no sag (I think)
   * Clear CMOS via battery, almost everytime when booting the PC after long shutdowns  

      * Only the battery method works
      * The Jbait1 short circuiting and CMOS clearing via button push doesn't work
      * The PC is temporarily working as of now (typing this via PC)

\- PC crashes -&gt; black screen (PC still running)

* There is no overheating, checked with MSI afterburner overlay  

   * GPU temps: around 40-50%
   * CPU temps: around 50-60%
* GPU usage goes to like 99% and down to 1% instantly and back up, never between them like 50% or 60% or 70%

\- Can't access Mobo BIOS (it think is corrupted or something):

* Tried all the keys: DEL, F11, Ctrl + F5  

   * All just takes me to nowhere, the DEL took be to partial BIOS -&gt; can't do anything there, can't selecting anything, can't even escape back to booting -&gt; always have to press the PC button to turn it off and restart it
   * F11 took me to just MSI logo, nothing happening
   * Ctrl + F5 (for Flashing BIOS) -&gt; showed two boxes, no text on it and all blank

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What I've tried doing:

* Hardware related:  

   * Switch up PCIE cables, just breaking the splits and connecting the 6pin with the other's 2pin
   * Changed 2 ram sticks' places, just took the second one and insert it at the first one's slot
   * Moved GPU PCIE slots, now using the second PCIE express slot
* Software related:  

   * Uninstall and install GPU drivers
   * Reset Windows
   * Installed Directx12
   * Updated all the possible drivers
* Tried to stress test GPU -&gt; started glitching before even overheating and crashed after like 1 minute (black screen)",1,1620944326
2986,"A nice, but misguided user","One of our users was scanning documents and was trying to send it to their external personal email address and typo'd it. Since there was personal financial information on it he was understandably concerned.

I check all sorts of logs, before I decide to login to the account that we use to send the scans from all out copiers. This is an account we do not monitor at all.

In there I see that someone in our Accounting office replies to each scanned document confirming that they have received the scan and thanking...someone?

I guess she thinks that the documents go to us and we then email them directly to her? I mean at least she was saying thank you. Probably the nicest inbox that we actually manage.

TL:DR; Someone thinks we sit around all day waiting for scanned documents to come in and immediately email them to the appropriate person, confirms that they received the scan and says thank you.",1,1620935367
2987,"""My scanner isn't working""","This didn't happen directly to me but a coworker on my team.  At the time we were tier 2 local support and there's tons of people there.  Anyways my coworker comes back from helping a customer with a scanner issue and you could tell he had a story.  


So we all gathered around and wanted to hear it.  

He said, ""Well I had a scanner ticket and went to this lady's desk."" He worked hardware breakfix so that makes sense.

""I asked the lady to show me the issue.""

2988,“Where has the search box gone?”,"I doubt I am alone with this one ;)

I’m not sure about anyone else, but recently our organisation updated Outlook to a much newer version which moved the search box from the top of the email list (below the ribbon) to the very top of the window itself (above the ribbon). 

Ahh yes - *that* update, I hear the support desk officers say. 

I don’t work at the service desk but I’m know as ‘that computer guy’ in my department. 

So far I have had 5 people in 24 hours ask “where has the search box gone??” to which the response has been “look up, yep the very, very top... okey got it?”

It’s interesting how much a simple UI design wave can cause such waves.

So - how’s your week going?",1,1620928826
2989,Call the exterminator!,"This is my favorite story to tell. Other persons name is not really C Hickens, pinky promise.

A few years ago I was working as a casework supervisor/desktop support tech on a major disaster. We're talking one if the biggest disasters to ever hit this area, and in the top for the country. One town had over 30 inches of rain, and much of the area is at or below sea level so it sat there for weeks, and people were in emergency shelters for months. I was there at the start but got called away for a different disaster a couple weeks in, ended up closing out two smaller operations, and then came back a few months later (about 4 months after the flooding). This happened during my second time there.

For some reason the organization I was there for decided that part way through they’d try their new model of having caseworkers work virtually rather than meeting clients in person. This was intended to save money as we could have caseworkers work from home rather than flying a few dozen people to the disaster location and putting them in hotels and giving them rental cars for months, but as this was the first rollout they had everyone working at a central office so we could iron out the kinks as they came along (and there were *a lot* of them, every day). Also, because if some irregularities from previous case workers that meant we wouldn’t pass audit we had to rework every case so they’d pass muster— something like 25,000 cases. 

I had a fairly solid understanding of how our systems worked and computers in general, and had just left a job as a desktop support tech in a major library, I became the point person for any tech issues that didn’t require needing new hardware or modifying the systems- mainly helping users, that had little to no knowledge about some of the programs we were using, figure out how to do what they need to do. 

As it always goes, some of the people deploying caseworkers didn’t get the memo about how the site worked and the qualifications needed to come work with us. This mainly led to them sending us people that generally knew how to use computers but were far from experts at our systems. Not a big issue, they were great at learning how to do everything and stuck around for months so we weren’t having to train new people every few weeks like they were doing when this project started. The exception to this was Carol.

Carol was a wonderful old lady. I hadn’t worked with her before but had heard she was a wonderful caseworker and did great with clients. She would work cases thoroughly, get aid out, and close the case quickly. The only issue was that Carol always did the work on paper and handed it off to her supervisor to be entered into the database. This wasn’t normally a problem when she worked at her local office as there was only a few cases a month so the supervisor had plenty of time to get everything done, but we were working entirely virtually, with almost no face to face contact, and had far too many cases to have another person sit with her and enter everything.

I was put in charge of training Carol. I met with her early in the morning gave her her credential, training manual, and phone, and showed her to her work space. I had some very urgent work that was going to take about 30 minutes so I told her to login and read a few pages of the training manual and I’d be right back.

I get my tasks done and make a cup of coffee and head back to get started with Carol and find her sitting at the work station with the computer off.

Me: Where you able to get through those pages in the training binder and sign in?

Carol: I read the pages but the computer isn’t turned on.

My brain immediately just to the week prior. We had some power issues but everything seemed to be working fine over the past few days. I *really* hope it’s not happening again as it was going to take us 3-4 days to make up the work and it largely fell on the supervisors and managers who were already working 12-16 hours days, 6 days a week. I had been getting about 4 hours of sleep every day for 3-4 weeks at this point, so my brain immediately went to the worst before even beginning to find the problem.

I jump into troubleshoot mode and press the power button to see what happens and… it boots right up. No problems at all.

Carol: How did you do that?

Me: I just pressed the power button.

Carol: Oh, I just thought it’d be on already. I didn’t know I needed to do that.

Alright, this is going to be a fun training session 🙃

Me: Okay, go ahead and log in.

Carol: How do I do that?

Me: Just use the mouse and click into the top box and put in your username and then put your password in the bottom box.

Carol: My what name? Is it just “Carol Hickens?”

Me: Your username. It’s the first line in the paper I gave you.

Carol: My what name?

Me: Just type what’s on the top line into the top box and then put what’s on the second line on the second box.

Carol: Oh okay, how do I do that?

Me: Use the mouse to cl-

Carol quickly jumped up and screamed while simultaneously flinging the training binder directly at my genitals.

Carol: THERE'S A MOUSE?! Where??!? I don't see it!!

Everyone on the floor's attention immediately came to the screaming woman, except the couple of the people nearby that started looking for the mouse.

Carol was transferred to a different department a few hours later where she didn’t have to use a computer and I hear she did great work. I worked with her supervisor a couple weeks later and found out that in her 82 years of life she had never used a computer. Shocking, I know. Who would've guessed? Definitely not as shocking as finding out she was 82 though, she looked like she was in her 60s.

The mouse was never found.",1,1620921902

2991,A short struggle involving screenshots,"Background: I work for a small-ish CRM company as a support analyst (fancy term for 1st/2nd line support). Our customers are usually between 50 and 500 users. We have a couple of partner companies that service our smaller customers, or those where we expect them not to require much support, but they can always forward tickets to us if it is too specific for them. 

This happened last week, while I was working through tickets as normal. We get a small burst of new tickets that need to be prioritised, so I open up the first email. It was from one of our partners, and it was their usual email template detailing the issue as raised by the customer, and a section for additional notes that their support guys can fill in.

Additional Notes: Sorry, can't read the screenshot.

The email had an image attached, and it was an exceptionally blurry, side-angle photo of the corner of the customer's monitor - no way anyone on earth could have made out what the error message said. 

We had to email them back essentially saying ""yeah us neither."" What did they expect? We don't have the ability to zoom and enhance like on crime shows!

What makes it worse is that the customer has to pay £200 per case they raise with this partner's support team...I think they might incur extra charges as well if they have to escalate to us.

I've also had to deal with customers emailing in a screenshot on their phone of their WhatsApp messages where someone has attached a blurry photo of their monitor...really makes me question my own sanity.",1,1620912676
2992,Wassup fellas?,"I work as tech support for a company that provides system administration and automation equipment for shops and supermarkets. 

Recently, a woman called me and said that their main server is not working and the OPS makes a strange noise. 

As usual, I asked her to restart the equipment and see what happens. She said nothing happened. Then, I asked her to check the power source cause if OPS makes a strange noise, it may be the lack of power. She said everything is ok. 

Then she called her son to help her. Maybe that guy was about 15 y.o. and I told him to do the same, but nothing really happened. Their ""sysadmin"" was in the hospital, so there where nobody to help them. It took about 2 hours to explain what they need to find and how it looks. I already had 1 hour of overtime, and nobody was in the office, but I couldn't let those people alone without any help.

They asked me to come to their town, it was 100km from the city, but they were ready to pay me. So, I decided to go there and help them. The road took one hour and a half. When I arrived, I went straight to the server and connected my laptop. Guess what the problem was? The skin power! The server sent the signal through OPS that he needs 220V. I told them from the beginning to check the power source. Anyways... Their whole equipment was ancient, and it couldn't withstand 220V anymore. Sometimes it was turning off automatically. They used old PLC-2 on Intel 8080. 

In the end, I decided to unplug their equipment and replace it with new microprocessors. Unfortunately, their budget was limited, so we decided to sell the old tools on, add a bit of money, and buy new ones. 

Now everything works well. But I can't get the point. Wtf this server responsible guy did the whole year? Their system was stopping 3-4 times a week, and he was always turning the power on again and again. Really??",1,1620907273
2993,My keyboard won't read my ID card,"This happened at an IT support job I had a couple of years ago. The only context needed is that our clients required specific ID-cards issues to them, to log into various system. This is my first post, and English is not my native language, so please be kind!  

The call started in the most amazing way possible. I answered the phone, and was immediately greeted by a man who sounded very nervous, and a woman screaming hysterically in the background that she was ""having a psychosis"". The man explained that his wife had called us 8 times this morning (we had received a total of 5 calls this morning, all from different users) and that she had waited 30 minutes in queue to even get to speak to us (our support line did not have a queue). I asked him to explain what the problem is.

man: my wife can't access critical systems that she needs.

me: what are these systems? Is she getting any error messages?

man: \*to woman\* what are the sys-

woman: THEY'RE NOT WORKING!

man: They're not working!

me: Could you explain what is happening when she is trying to access the systems? Could I speak to her directly?

man: She doesn't want to talk to you

woman: I REFUSE TO TALK TO THEM AGAIN

The call basically went on like this. I was trying to ask questions to get information to solve their problem, but they kept throwing accusations or other unrelated pieces of information, and we were unfortunately not allowed to hang up on clients, and after a while it came to this:

me: is there a problem with her internet access? is her login card not working? 

woman: THEY ARE BREAKING THE LAW

man: she says you are breaking the law!

woman: THEIR SYSTEMS NEED TO BE AVAILABLE

me: I'm sorry. This call has gone on for 15 minutes now and you still haven't told me what system you're trying to acc-

man: The systems need to be available

me:  Yes, but there are no servers or services reported down in our system. I need to at least know what system she's trying to access if I'm going to escalate this. But before I can do that I need to be sure that it's not just a client-side issue.

man: \*to woman\* He says he needs to know what systems are you trying to access, can you show m-

woman: TELL THEM! 

man: You should know that she has friends in \*insert generic management group\*, and if this isn't solved now they will get involved.

woman: THEY WILL FIRE THE \*\*\*\* OUT OF HIM

\*I was quiet for a few seconds because I did not expect this, although the thought of being fired from the job seemed kinda nice at this point!\*

me: I'm sorry, I don't know who they are. But could you please tell me what the issue is when she's trying to access the systems.

Instead of answering the question, the man asked for the number of my boss. Which I provided. He then proceeded to threaten to call that number that I had just given him, unless I solved the issue, and fast! 

me: alright. Just try to access the system now and tell me what happens.

man: he says to try and log in now

\*a few seconds pass\*

woman: ITS NOT WORKING

\*loud bangs\*

Now im not sure if all these years in customer support has destroyed my brain, or if this genuinely makes sense, but as soon as I heard that noise, I realized she was slamming her login card on the keyboard.

me: what card reader is she using?

man: card reader?

\*loud bangs continue\*

woman: WHY CANT IT JUST \*\*\*\*\*\*\* WORK

me: if her computer does not have a slot for cards, she needs to plug a card reader into the computer.

him: That sounds overkill. why?

me: so it can read the card and log her into the system

him: then why don't we need a card reader everywhere?

me: you only need them for some of our systems

him: no, like in general. This is bullshit. We don't even own a card reader.

\*caller hangs up\*

They called again later, and my colleague was the lucky guy this time. It turned out she wasn't even using the login card that the company had issued for her. She was slamming her drivers license against a laptop keyboard and expecting that to authenticate her to the systems she was trying to access.

Most of our clients were better than this. But there were a few calls that, when I write them out, they just look completely unbelievable. Even so, I have found that being a tech support guy is often like being a free therapist that you're allowed to shout at. Even so I did generally like the job for the remaining time I had it, and eventually switched to work with back end msp.",1,1620904053
